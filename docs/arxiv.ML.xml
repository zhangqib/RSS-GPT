Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are proven effective in extracting complex node and structural information from graph data. While current GNNs perform well in node classification tasks within in-distribution (ID) settings, real-world scenarios often present distribution shifts, leading to the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes. OOD detection in graphs is a crucial and challenging task. Most existing research focuses on homogeneous graphs, but real-world graphs are often heterogeneous, consisting of diverse node and edge types. This heterogeneity adds complexity and enriches the informational content. To the best of our knowledge, OOD detection in heterogeneous graphs remains an underexplored area. In this context, we propose a novel methodology for OOD detection in heterogeneous graphs (OODHG) that aims to achieve two main objectives: 1) detecting OOD nodes and 2) classifying all ID nodes based on the first task's results. Specifically, we learn representations for each node in the heterogeneous graph, calculate energy values to determine whether nodes are OOD, and then classify ID nodes. To leverage the structural information of heterogeneous graphs, we introduce a meta-path-based energy propagation mechanism and an energy constraint to enhance the distinction between ID and OOD nodes. Extensive experimental findings substantiate the simplicity and effectiveness of OODHG, demonstrating its superiority over baseline models in OOD detection tasks and its accuracy in ID node classification.

<div> Hierarchical Multi-Label Generation, generative framework, Probabilistic Level Constraints, taxonomy, SOTA performance
Summary:
Hierarchical Extreme Multi-Label Classification is challenging due to complex hierarchical label connections and a large number of labels. Traditional methods like clustering and multistage classification have limitations in controlling generative model outputs. This paper introduces a Hierarchical Multi-Label Generation (HMG) approach using a generative framework with Probabilistic Level Constraints (PLC) to accurately generate hierarchical labels within a taxonomy. By generating all relevant labels across levels for each document without clustering, the model can precisely control output count, length, and level. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in HMG tasks and significantly improves model output control compared to previous research.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical Extreme Multi-Label Classification poses greater difficulties compared to traditional multi-label classification because of the intricate hierarchical connections of labels within a domain-specific taxonomy and the substantial number of labels. Some of the prior research endeavors centered on classifying text through several ancillary stages such as the cluster algorithm and multiphase classification. Others made attempts to leverage the assistance of generative methods yet were unable to properly control the output of the generative model. We redefine the task from hierarchical multi-Label classification to Hierarchical Multi-Label Generation (HMG) and employ a generative framework with Probabilistic Level Constraints (PLC) to generate hierarchical labels within a specific taxonomy that have complex hierarchical relationships. The approach we proposed in this paper enables the framework to generate all relevant labels across levels for each document without relying on preliminary operations like clustering. Meanwhile, it can control the model output precisely in terms of count, length, and level aspects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves a new SOTA performance in the HMG task, but also has a much better performance in constrained the output of model than previous research work.

<br>
Summary: <br>
This article introduces a novel Proximity Attention mechanism in an encoder-decoder architecture (PAPN) for route prediction in last-mile delivery and first-mile pickup logistics. The model combines local and global attention via a multi-head transformer encoder. Proximity attention is used to prioritize locations during decoding for improved prediction accuracy. Tested on a real-world dataset, LaDE, the PAPN model outperforms existing supervised systems and is on par with a reinforcement learning method, DRL4Route. This approach shows promise in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of last-mile delivery optimization processes. <div>
arXiv:2505.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization of the last-mile delivery and first-mile pickup of parcels is an integral part of the broader logistics optimization pipeline as it entails both cost and resource efficiency as well as a heightened service quality. Such optimization requires accurate route and time prediction systems to adapt to different scenarios in advance. This work tackles the first building block, namely route prediction. This is done by introducing a novel Proximity Attention mechanism in an encoder-decoder architecture utilizing a Pointer Network in the decoding process (Proximity Attention Encoder and Pointer Network decoder: PAPN) to leverage the underlying connections between the different visitable pickup positions at each timestep. To this local attention process is coupled global context computing via a multi-head attention transformer encoder. The obtained global context is then mixed to an aggregated version of the local embedding thus achieving a mix of global and local attention for complete modeling of the problems. Proximity attention is also used in the decoding process to skew predictions towards the locations with the highest attention scores and thus using inter-connectivity of locations as a base for next-location prediction. This method is trained, validated and tested on a large industry-level dataset of real-world, large-scale last-mile delivery and first-mile pickup named LaDE[1]. This approach shows noticeable promise, outperforming all state-of-the-art supervised systems in terms of most metrics used for benchmarking methods on this dataset while still being competitive with the best-performing reinforcement learning method named DRL4Route[2].

Abstract: The extraction of molecular structures and reaction data from scientific documents is challenging due to their varied, unstructured chemical formats and complex document layouts. To address this, we introduce MolMole, a vision-based deep learning framework that unifies molecule detection, reaction diagram parsing, and optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) into a single pipeline for automating the extraction of chemical data directly from page-level documents. Recognizing the lack of a standard page-level benchmark and evaluation metric, we also present a testset of 550 pages annotated with molecule bounding boxes, reaction labels, and MOLfiles, along with a novel evaluation metric. Experimental results demonstrate that MolMole outperforms existing toolkits on both our benchmark and public datasets. The benchmark testset will be publicly available, and the MolMole toolkit will be accessible soon through an interactive demo on the LG AI Research website.

Abstract: We propose a neural network-based computational framework for the simultaneous optimization of structural topology, curved layers, and path orientations to achieve strong anisotropic strength in fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites while ensuring manufacturability. Our framework employs three implicit neural fields to represent geometric shape, layer sequence, and fiber orientation. This enables the direct formulation of both design and manufacturability objectives - such as anisotropic strength, structural volume, machine motion control, layer curvature, and layer thickness - into an integrated and differentiable optimization process. By incorporating these objectives as loss functions, the framework ensures that the resultant composites exhibit optimized mechanical strength while remaining its manufacturability for filament-based multi-axis 3D printing across diverse hardware platforms. Physical experiments demonstrate that the composites generated by our co-optimization method can achieve an improvement of up to 33.1% in failure loads compared to composites with sequentially optimized structures and manufacturing sequences.

Summary: 
This study aimed to develop a method for predicting insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes, using wearable device data and blood biomarkers. The researchers used a large dataset of 1,165 participants to train deep neural network models that can predict insulin resistance better when combining wearable data and blood biomarkers. The models showed promising results in predicting insulin resistance, with high sensitivity and specificity, especially in obese and sedentary individuals. The performance of the models was validated on an independent cohort, demonstrating their generalizability. Additionally, the study integrated the predicted insulin resistance values into a large language model agent to aid in interpretation and personalized recommendations. This research opens up possibilities for early detection of individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes, allowing for timely interventions to prevent the disease. <br> <div>

Abstract: Insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes, is characterized by impaired insulin action in tissues. Current methods for measuring insulin resistance, while effective, are expensive, inaccessible, not widely available and hinder opportunities for early intervention. In this study, we remotely recruited the largest dataset to date across the US to study insulin resistance (N=1,165 participants, with median BMI=28 kg/m2, age=45 years, HbA1c=5.4%), incorporating wearable device time series data and blood biomarkers, including the ground-truth measure of insulin resistance, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We developed deep neural network models to predict insulin resistance based on readily available digital and blood biomarkers. Our results show that our models can predict insulin resistance by combining both wearable data and readily available blood biomarkers better than either of the two data sources separately (R2=0.5, auROC=0.80, Sensitivity=76%, and specificity 84%). The model showed 93% sensitivity and 95% adjusted specificity in obese and sedentary participants, a subpopulation most vulnerable to developing type 2 diabetes and who could benefit most from early intervention. Rigorous evaluation of model performance, including interpretability, and robustness, facilitates generalizability across larger cohorts, which is demonstrated by reproducing the prediction performance on an independent validation cohort (N=72 participants). Additionally, we demonstrated how the predicted insulin resistance can be integrated into a large language model agent to help understand and contextualize HOMA-IR values, facilitating interpretation and safe personalized recommendations. This work offers the potential for early detection of people at risk of type 2 diabetes and thereby facilitate earlier implementation of preventative strategies.

- The study compares a reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, with non-reasoning LLMs for candidate evaluation in a text-to-SQL task.
- DeepSeek-R1 outperforms CodeLlama-7B and CodeLlama-13B in discrimination accuracy and execution accuracy despite having fewer parameters.
- Providing more context or compute budget for reasoning does not significantly improve discrimination performance.
- Reasoning models struggle more with generation compared to discrimination, unlike non-reasoning LLMs.
- The study suggests that reasoning models excel as discriminators in planning frameworks, offering insights into their optimal role within LLM infrastructures.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) with reasoning capabilities offer a promising path for improving candidate evaluation in planning frameworks, but their relative performance against traditional non-reasoning models remains largely underexplored. In this study, we benchmark a distilled 1.5B parameter reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1) against several state-of-the-art non-reasoning LLMs within a generator-discriminator LLM planning framework for the text-to-SQL task. For this, we introduce a novel method for extracting soft scores from the chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs from reasoning that enables fine-grained ranking of candidates. Our central hypothesis is that reasoning models are more effective discriminators than non-reasoning LLMs. Our results show that distilled DeepSeek-R1-1.5B achieves up to $87\%$ higher F1 and $3.7\%$ better discrimination accuracy than CodeLlama-7B, as well as $3.7\%$ higher execution accuracy than CodeLlama-13B, despite having significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, we find that there is a limit to the logical capabilities of reasoning models, and only providing more context or allowing more compute budget for reasoning is not enough to improve their discrimination performance. Finally, we demonstrate that, unlike non-reasoning LLMs, reasoning models find generation more challenging than discrimination and may underperform as generators compared to smaller non-reasoning LLMs. Our work highlights the potential of reasoning models as discriminators in agentic frameworks, far outweighing their capabilities as generators, offering insights into their optimal role within LLM planning infrastructures.

Summary: 
The article introduces two novel lightweight 1D convolutional neural networks, ArrhythmiNet V1 and V2, designed for real-time arrhythmia classification on edge devices. These models have small memory footprints and high classification accuracies across five classes of cardiac arrhythmias. They incorporate interpretability techniques to highlight physiologically meaningful patterns in ECG signals. The study demonstrates the feasibility of combining interpretability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency in wearable and embedded ECG monitoring systems. The models offer efficient automated analysis of ECG signals, addressing the need for accurate and timely detection of cardiac arrhythmias. However, there are limitations related to dataset diversity and generalizability that need to be addressed in future research. <div>

Abstract: Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of life-threatening cardiac events, highlighting the urgent need for accurate and timely detection. Electrocardiography (ECG) remains the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia diagnosis; however, manual interpretation is time-consuming, dependent on clinical expertise, and prone to human error. Although deep learning has advanced automated ECG analysis, many existing models abstract away the signal's intrinsic temporal and morphological features, lack interpretability, and are computationally intensive-hindering their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this work, we propose two novel lightweight 1D convolutional neural networks, ArrhythmiNet V1 and V2, optimized for efficient, real-time arrhythmia classification on edge devices. Inspired by MobileNet's depthwise separable convolutional design, these models maintain memory footprints of just 302.18 KB and 157.76 KB, respectively, while achieving classification accuracies of 0.99 (V1) and 0.98 (V2) on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset across five classes: Normal Sinus Rhythm, Left Bundle Branch Block, Right Bundle Branch Block, Atrial Premature Contraction, and Premature Ventricular Contraction. In order to ensure clinical transparency and relevance, we integrate Shapley Additive Explanations and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, enabling both local and global interpretability. These techniques highlight physiologically meaningful patterns such as the QRS complex and T-wave that contribute to the model's predictions. We also discuss performance-efficiency trade-offs and address current limitations related to dataset diversity and generalizability. Overall, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of combining interpretability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency in practical, wearable, and embedded ECG monitoring systems.

The article introduces a novel deep-learning neural network architecture for stochastic differential equations (SDEs), specifically designed to efficiently learn martingales in deep learning models. By leveraging high-order weak approximation algorithms, the architecture allows for the accurate pricing of financial derivatives. Central to this new approach is the use of explicit Runge-Kutta type algorithms, which approximate the SDEs through iterative compositions and linear combinations of vector fields. The study explores the behavior of deep neural networks based on this architecture, shedding light on their effectiveness in tackling complex financial problems. <div>

Abstract: A new deep-learning neural network architecture based on high-order weak approximation algorithms for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is proposed. The architecture enables the efficient learning of martingales by deep learning models. The behaviour of deep neural networks based on this architecture, when applied to the problem of pricing financial derivatives, is also examined. The core of this new architecture lies in the high-order weak approximation algorithms of the explicit Runge--Kutta type, wherein the approximation is realised solely through iterative compositions and linear combinations of vector fields of the target SDEs.

Abstract: With the development of Artificial Intelligence, numerous real-world tasks have been accomplished using technology integrated with deep learning. To achieve optimal performance, deep neural networks typically require large volumes of data for training. Although advances in data augmentation have facilitated the acquisition of vast datasets, most of this data is concentrated in domains like images and speech. However, there has been relatively less focus on augmenting time-series data. To address this gap and generate a substantial amount of time-series data, we propose a simple and effective method that combines the Diffusion and Transformer models. By utilizing an adjusted diffusion denoising model to generate a large volume of initial time-step action data, followed by employing a Transformer model to predict subsequent actions, and incorporating a weighted loss function to achieve convergence, the method demonstrates its effectiveness. Using the performance improvement of the model after applying augmented data as a benchmark, and comparing the results with those obtained without data augmentation or using traditional data augmentation methods, this approach shows its capability to produce high-quality augmented data.

Boolean neural networks offer hardware-efficient alternatives to real-valued models, with the use of quantization commonly seen. This study introduces a practical method for purely Boolean backpropagation for networks based on a specific chosen gate, operating directly in Boolean algebra without any numerical computations. Initial experiments confirm the feasibility of this approach. The benefits include the potential for more efficient hardware implementation and reduced resource usage. By focusing on Boolean operations, the training process becomes less complex and may lead to improved performance in specific tasks.

Abstract: Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains. The code is available at https://github.com/langfengQ/CoSo.

Abstract: The proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse downstream tasks necessitates efficient model selection, given the impracticality of fine-tuning all candidates due to computational constraints. Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a Hessian-based PAC-Bayes generalization bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel(NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods. We open-source our proposed LENSLLM model and corresponding results at the Github link: https://github.com/Susan571/LENSLLM.git.

Summary: 
Partial Bayesian neural networks (pBNNs) have shown promising performance by incorporating stochastic parameters within neural networks. A new training method using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers with guided proposals and gradient-based Markov kernels has been introduced. This method allows for non-parametric probabilistic estimation of stochastic parameters, leading to improved predictive performance and optimal loss compared to parametric methods. pBNNs also exhibit scalability on high-dimensional problems, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, pBNNs show efficiency in handling larger batch sizes, resulting in reduced training times and enhanced performance. <div>

Abstract: Partial Bayesian neural networks (pBNNs) have been shown to perform competitively with fully Bayesian neural networks while only having a subset of the parameters be stochastic. Using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers as the inference method for pBNNs gives a non-parametric probabilistic estimation of the stochastic parameters, and has shown improved performance over parametric methods. In this paper we introduce a new SMC-based training method for pBNNs by utilising a guided proposal and incorporating gradient-based Markov kernels, which gives us better scalability on high dimensional problems. We show that our new method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of predictive performance and optimal loss. We also show that pBNNs scale well with larger batch sizes, resulting in significantly reduced training times and often better performance.

<div> digital twin, foundation models, multimodal data, domain knowledge, spatial-temporal dynamics

Summary:
This position paper critiques current foundation models (FMs) for their reliance on token representations that fragment continuous real-world multimodal data. It argues that FMs should consider digital twin (DT) representations, which are outcome-driven digital replicas of physical processes, as an alternative. The limitations of current FMs include struggles in maintaining semantic coherence across modalities, capturing fine-grained spatial-temporal dynamics, and performing causal reasoning. Scaling up model size or expanding datasets cannot address these challenges. The machine learning community should adopt DT representations that provide physically grounded representations and preserve the continuous nature of real-world processes. DT representations explicitly encode domain knowledge, offering a solution to the limitations of token representations in FMs. <div>

Abstract: Current foundation models (FMs) rely on token representations that directly fragment continuous real-world multimodal data into discrete tokens. They limit FMs to learning real-world knowledge and relationships purely through statistical correlation rather than leveraging explicit domain knowledge. Consequently, current FMs struggle with maintaining semantic coherence across modalities, capturing fine-grained spatial-temporal dynamics, and performing causal reasoning. These limitations cannot be overcome by simply scaling up model size or expanding datasets. This position paper argues that the machine learning community should consider digital twin (DT) representations, which are outcome-driven digital representations that serve as building blocks for creating virtual replicas of physical processes, as an alternative to the token representation for building FMs. Finally, we discuss how DT representations can address these challenges by providing physically grounded representations that explicitly encode domain knowledge and preserve the continuous nature of real-world processes.

Summary: 
The article introduces SDM-InstructGLM, a novel framework for Graph Language Models (GLMs) that enhances scalability and efficiency without using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It proposes a similarity-degree-based biased random walk mechanism that selectively samples and encodes graph information within Large Language Models (LLMs) based on node-feature similarity and degree centrality. This approach improves token efficiency, reduces information loss, and enhances performance on graph-based tasks like node classification and link prediction. The results demonstrate the feasibility of processing graphs with LLMs alone, allowing for scalable and interpretable GLMs through instruction-based fine-tuning. This work opens up possibilities for GNN-free approaches to graph learning, utilizing LLMs as standalone graph reasoning models. The source code for this framework is available on GitHub. <br> <br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various natural language processing tasks; however, their application to graph-related problems remains limited, primarily due to scalability constraints and the absence of dedicated mechanisms for processing graph structures. Existing approaches predominantly integrate LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), using GNNs as feature encoders or auxiliary components. However, directly encoding graph structures within LLMs has been underexplored, particularly in the context of large-scale graphs where token limitations hinder effective representation. To address these challenges, we propose SDM-InstructGLM, a novel instruction-tuned Graph Language Model (InstructGLM) framework that enhances scalability and efficiency without relying on GNNs. Our method introduces a similarity-degree-based biased random walk mechanism, which selectively samples and encodes graph information based on node-feature similarity and degree centrality, ensuring an adaptive and structured representation within the LLM. This approach significantly improves token efficiency, mitigates information loss due to random sampling, and enhances performance on graph-based tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-only graph processing, enabling scalable and interpretable Graph Language Models (GLMs) optimized through instruction-based fine-tuning. This work paves the way for GNN-free approaches to graph learning, leveraging LLMs as standalone graph reasoning models. Our source code is available on GitHub.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel two-stage method for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) through low-rank and sparse composite approximation. The method addresses challenges related to the interaction between low-rank and sparse matrices, as well as weight allocation across different layers with varying redundancy levels. In the first stage, robust principal component analysis decomposes weight matrices into low-rank and sparse components. The second stage utilizes a probabilistic global optimization technique to identify low-rank and sparse structures within the optimized spaces. The method automatically detects redundancy across layers and manages the interaction between sparse and low-rank components, leading to superior performance compared to existing techniques for sparsification and composite approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Low-rank and sparse composite approximation is a natural idea to compress Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such an idea faces two primary challenges that adversely affect the performance of existing methods. The first challenge relates to the interaction and cooperation between low-rank and sparse matrices, while the second involves determining weight allocation across different layers, as redundancy varies considerably among them. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage LLM compression method with the capability of global rank and sparsity optimization. It is noteworthy that the overall optimization space is vast, making comprehensive optimization computationally prohibitive. Therefore, to reduce the optimization space, our first stage utilizes robust principal component analysis to decompose the weight matrices of LLMs into low-rank and sparse components, which span the low dimensional and sparse spaces containing the resultant low-rank and sparse matrices, respectively. In the second stage, we propose a probabilistic global optimization technique to jointly identify the low-rank and sparse structures within the above two spaces. The appealing feature of our approach is its ability to automatically detect the redundancy across different layers and to manage the interaction between the sparse and low-rank components. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art techniques for sparsification and composite approximation.

Summary: 
The article introduces QR-Adaptor, a novel approach that combines low-bit quantization and LoRA for efficient fine-tuning of large language models. Unlike previous methods based on SVD, QR-Adaptor leverages dynamic mixed precision to continuously improve model performance by jointly optimizing quantization components and low-rank spaces for each layer. By treating precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by downstream performance and memory usage, QR-Adaptor achieves a 4.89% accuracy improvement on GSM8K compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in some cases, it even outperforms the 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting. This unified, gradient-free strategy offers a promising solution for memory-efficient fine-tuning of quantized large language models. 
<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QLoRA effectively combines low-bit quantization and LoRA to achieve memory-friendly fine-tuning for large language models (LLM). Recently, methods based on SVD for continuous update iterations to initialize LoRA matrices to accommodate quantization errors have generally failed to consistently improve performance. Dynamic mixed precision is a natural idea for continuously improving the fine-tuning performance of quantized models, but previous methods often optimize low-rank subspaces or quantization components separately, without considering their synergy. To address this, we propose \textbf{QR-Adaptor}, a unified, gradient-free strategy that uses partial calibration data to jointly search the quantization components and the rank of low-rank spaces for each layer, thereby continuously improving model performance. QR-Adaptor does not minimize quantization error but treats precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by actual downstream performance and memory usage. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantized LoRA fine-tuning methods, our approach achieves a 4.89\% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, and in some cases even outperforms the 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting.

Abstract: RWKV is a modern RNN architecture with comparable performance to Transformer, but still faces challenges when deployed to resource-constrained devices. Post Training Quantization (PTQ), which is a an essential technique to reduce model size and inference latency, has been widely used in Transformer models. However, it suffers significant degradation of performance when applied to RWKV. This paper investigates and identifies two key constraints inherent in the properties of RWKV: (1) Non-linear operators hinder the parameter-fusion of both smooth- and rotation-based quantization, introducing extra computation overhead. (2) The larger amount of uniformly distributed weights poses challenges for cluster-based quantization, leading to reduced accuracy. To this end, we propose RWKVQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for RWKV models, consisting of two novel techniques: (1) a coarse-to-fine proxy capable of adaptively selecting different quantization approaches by assessing the uniformity and identifying outliers in the weights, and (2) a codebook optimization algorithm that enhances the performance of cluster-based quantization methods for element-wise multiplication in RWKV. Experiments show that RWKVQuant can quantize RWKV-6-14B into about 3-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss and 2.14x speed up.

<div> quantization, Mixture-of-Experts, large language models, efficiency, scalability

Summary:
Expert-Balanced Self-Sampling (EBSS) and Affinity-Guided Quantization (AGQ) are proposed in MoEQuant to address challenges faced by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs) during post-training quantization (PTQ). MoE models have sparse and dynamic characteristics that pose difficulties for traditional quantization methods, leading to accuracy degradation and limited generalization performance. EBSS creates a calibration set with balanced expert distributions by considering token probabilities and expert balance metrics. AGQ incorporates affinities between experts and samples, accurately evaluating the impact of samples on different experts within the MoE layer. Through experiments, MoEQuant achieves significant performance gains, with more than a 10-point accuracy improvement in HumanEval for DeepSeekMoE-16B under 4-bit quantization. This novel quantization framework enhances efficiency and scalability of MoE LLMs, overcoming challenges related to inter-expert and intra-expert imbalances in sample distribution and aggregation mechanisms. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs), which leverage dynamic routing and sparse activation to enhance efficiency and scalability, have achieved higher performance while reducing computational costs. However, these models face significant memory overheads, limiting their practical deployment and broader adoption. Post-training quantization (PTQ), a widely used method for compressing LLMs, encounters severe accuracy degradation and diminished generalization performance when applied to MoE models. This paper investigates the impact of MoE's sparse and dynamic characteristics on quantization and identifies two primary challenges: (1) Inter-expert imbalance, referring to the uneven distribution of samples across experts, which leads to insufficient and biased calibration for less frequently utilized experts; (2) Intra-expert imbalance, arising from MoE's unique aggregation mechanism, which leads to varying degrees of correlation between different samples and their assigned experts. To address these challenges, we propose MoEQuant, a novel quantization framework tailored for MoE LLMs. MoE-Quant includes two novel techniques: 1) Expert-Balanced Self-Sampling (EBSS) is an efficient sampling method that efficiently constructs a calibration set with balanced expert distributions by leveraging the cumulative probabilities of tokens and expert balance metrics as guiding factors. 2) Affinity-Guided Quantization (AGQ), which incorporates affinities between experts and samples into the quantization process, thereby accurately assessing the impact of individual samples on different experts within the MoE layer. Experiments demonstrate that MoEQuant achieves substantial performance gains (more than 10 points accuracy gain in the HumanEval for DeepSeekMoE-16B under 4-bit quantization) and boosts efficiency.

Summary: 
Randomized Uphill Climbing (RUC) has been successful in generating state-of-the-art equity alpha factors for hedge funds. The proposal aims to expand RUC into a versatile feature optimization framework for multivariate time series forecasting. By randomly combining operators from a specific grammar, candidate feature programs are synthesized and assessed using surrogate models on rolling windows. The method leverages nested cross-validation and information theoretic shrinkage to ensure stability and filter out unreliable features. By separating feature discovery from GPU-intensive deep learning, the approach offers faster iteration cycles, reduced energy consumption, and improved interpretability. This methodology not only allows for accurate forecasting but also promotes transparency, enabling various organizations such as energy regulators and climate risk NGOs to make informed decisions without relying on black-box models.

Abstract: Randomized Uphill Climbing is a lightweight, stochastic search heuristic that has delivered state of the art equity alpha factors for quantitative hedge funds. I propose to generalize RUC into a model agnostic feature optimization framework for multivariate time series forecasting. The core idea is to synthesize candidate feature programs by randomly composing operators from a domain specific grammar, score candidates rapidly with inexpensive surrogate models on rolling windows, and filter instability via nested cross validation and information theoretic shrinkage. By decoupling feature discovery from GPU heavy deep learning, the method promises faster iteration cycles, lower energy consumption, and greater interpretability. Societal relevance: accurate, transparent forecasting tools empower resource constrained institutions, energy regulators, climate risk NGOs to make data driven decisions without proprietary black box models.

Abstract: This article introduces Perception-Informed Neural Networks (PrINNs), a framework designed to incorporate perception-based information into neural networks, addressing both systems with known and unknown physics laws or differential equations. Moreover, PrINNs extend the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their variants, offering a platform for the integration of diverse forms of perception precisiation, including singular, probability distribution, possibility distribution, interval, and fuzzy graph. In fact, PrINNs allow neural networks to model dynamical systems by integrating expert knowledge and perception-based information through loss functions, enabling the creation of modern data-driven models. Some of the key contributions include Mixture of Experts Informed Neural Networks (MOEINNs), which combine heterogeneous expert knowledge into the network, and Transformed-Knowledge Informed Neural Networks (TKINNs), which facilitate the incorporation of meta-information for enhanced model performance. Additionally, Fuzzy-Informed Neural Networks (FINNs) as a modern class of fuzzy deep neural networks leverage fuzzy logic constraints within a deep learning architecture, allowing online training without pre-training and eliminating the need for defuzzification. PrINNs represent a significant step forward in bridging the gap between traditional physics-based modeling and modern data-driven approaches, enabling neural networks to learn from both structured physics laws and flexible perception-based rules. This approach empowers neural networks to operate in uncertain environments, model complex systems, and discover new forms of differential equations, making PrINNs a powerful tool for advancing computational science and engineering.

Abstract: Harmful algal blooms are a growing threat to inland water quality and public health worldwide, creating an urgent need for efficient, accurate, and cost-effective detection methods. This research introduces a high-performing methodology that integrates multiple open-source remote sensing data with advanced artificial intelligence models. Key data sources include Copernicus Sentinel-2 optical imagery, the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and NOAA's High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) climate data, all efficiently retrieved using platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Microsoft Planetary Computer (MPC). The NIR and two SWIR bands from Sentinel-2, the altitude from the elevation model, the temperature and wind from NOAA as well as the longitude and latitude were the most important features. The approach combines two types of machine learning models, tree-based models and a neural network, into an ensemble for classifying algal bloom severity. While the tree models performed strongly on their own, incorporating a neural network added robustness and demonstrated how deep learning models can effectively use diverse remote sensing inputs. The method leverages high-resolution satellite imagery and AI-driven analysis to monitor algal blooms dynamically, and although initially developed for a NASA competition in the U.S., it shows potential for global application. The complete code is available for further adaptation and practical implementation, illustrating the convergence of remote sensing data and AI to address critical environmental challenges (https://github.com/IoannisNasios/HarmfulAlgalBloomDetection).

<div> Joint distribution, local density, multimodal semantic consistency, dynamic data selection, data augmentation

Summary:
The article introduces a novel online data training framework that combines dynamic data selection and data augmentation for improved training efficiency and performance. By estimating each sample's joint distribution of local density and multimodal semantic consistency, the method can select augmentation-suitable samples while filtering out noisy or ambiguous data. This results in a significant reduction in dataset size without compromising model generalization. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets and architectures, such as achieving a 50% reduction in training costs on ImageNet-1k with no loss in performance. Additionally, the method enhances noise resistance and improves model robustness, showcasing its practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Dynamic data selection aims to accelerate training with lossless performance. However, reducing training data inherently limits data diversity, potentially hindering generalization. While data augmentation is widely used to enhance diversity, it is typically not optimized in conjunction with selection. As a result, directly combining these techniques fails to fully exploit their synergies. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel online data training framework that, for the first time, unifies dynamic data selection and augmentation, achieving both training efficiency and enhanced performance. Our method estimates each sample's joint distribution of local density and multimodal semantic consistency, allowing for the targeted selection of augmentation-suitable samples while suppressing the inclusion of noisy or ambiguous data. This enables a more significant reduction in dataset size without sacrificing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on various benchmark datasets and architectures, e.g., reducing 50\% training costs on ImageNet-1k with lossless performance. Furthermore, our approach enhances noise resistance and improves model robustness, reinforcing its practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Summary: ScarceGAN addresses the identification of extremely rare samples in multi-dimensional longitudinal telemetry data with small label prior. It deals with severe scarcity in the positive class, multi-class negative samples, and unlabelled data. By re-formulating semi-supervised GAN to accommodate weakly labelled multi-class negative samples, ScarceGAN improves recall to over 85% for the scarce class, surpassing vanilla GAN by 60%. It outperforms benchmarks in identifying positive imbalanced classes and achieves a new benchmark in identifying rare attack classes in the KDDCUP99 dataset. <div>
arXiv:2505.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ScarceGAN which focuses on identification of extremely rare or scarce samples from multi-dimensional longitudinal telemetry data with small and weak label prior. We specifically address: (i) severe scarcity in positive class, stemming from both underlying organic skew in the data, as well as extremely limited labels; (ii) multi-class nature of the negative samples, with uneven density distributions and partially overlapping feature distributions; and (iii) massively unlabelled data leading to tiny and weak prior on both positive and negative classes, and possibility of unseen or unknown behavior in the unlabelled set, especially in the negative class. Although related to PU learning problems, we contend that knowledge (or lack of it) on the negative class can be leveraged to learn the compliment of it (i.e., the positive class) better in a semi-supervised manner. To this effect, ScarceGAN re-formulates semi-supervised GAN by accommodating weakly labelled multi-class negative samples and the available positive samples. It relaxes the supervised discriminator's constraint on exact differentiation between negative samples by introducing a 'leeway' term for samples with noisy prior. We propose modifications to the cost objectives of discriminator, in supervised and unsupervised path as well as that of the generator. For identifying risky players in skill gaming, this formulation in whole gives us a recall of over 85% (~60% jump over vanilla semi-supervised GAN) on our scarce class with very minimal verbosity in the unknown space. Further ScarceGAN outperforms the recall benchmarks established by recent GAN based specialized models for the positive imbalanced class identification and establishes a new benchmark in identifying one of rare attack classes (0.09%) in the intrusion dataset from the KDDCUP99 challenge.

Abstract: Information Filtering Networks (IFNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems through globally sparse yet locally dense and interpretable structures that capture multivariate dependencies. This review offers a comprehensive account of IFNs, covering their theoretical foundations, construction methodologies, and diverse applications. Tracing their origins from early network-based models to advanced formulations such as the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph (TMFG) and the Maximally Filtered Clique Forest (MFCF), the paper highlights how IFNs address key challenges in high-dimensional data-driven modeling. IFNs and their construction methodologies are intrinsically higher-order networks that generate simplicial complexes-structures that are only now becoming popular in the broader literature. Applications span fields including finance, biology, psychology, and artificial intelligence, where IFNs improve interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive performance. Special attention is given to their role in graphical modeling, where IFNs enable the estimation of sparse inverse covariance matrices with greater accuracy and scalability than traditional approaches like Graphical LASSO. Finally, the review discusses recent developments that integrate IFNs with machine learning and deep learning, underscoring their potential not only to bridge classical network theory with contemporary data-driven paradigms, but also to shape the architectures of deep learning models themselves.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in everyday coding tasks but struggle with more complex tasks requiring deep understanding of program semantics. To address this, a method is proposed to synthetically generate code reasoning training data using a semantic inequivalence game (SInQ). In this game, a generator agent creates program variants that differ semantically, while an evaluator agent identifies input examples causing divergence in behavior between the original programs and variants. Through semi-adversarial training, this approach allows for unlimited improvement through self-play with infinite computational resources. Evaluation on various benchmarks, including cross-language vulnerability detection and Python identifier swap, demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in enhancing LLM performance. The code and synthetic data generated are released for replication and fine-tuning of LLMs.

arXiv:2505.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on everyday coding tasks, but they can fail on complex tasks that require non-trivial reasoning about program semantics. Finding training examples to teach LLMs to solve these tasks can be challenging.
  In this work, we explore a method to synthetically generate code reasoning training data based on a semantic inequivalence game SInQ: a generator agent creates program variants that are semantically distinct, derived from a dataset of real-world programming tasks, while an evaluator agent has to identify input examples that cause the original programs and the generated variants to diverge in their behaviour, with the agents training each other semi-adversarially. We prove that this setup enables theoretically unlimited improvement through self-play in the limit of infinite computational resources.
  We evaluated our approach on multiple code generation and understanding benchmarks, including cross-language vulnerability detection (Lu et al., 2021), where our method improves vulnerability detection in C/C++ code despite being trained exclusively on Python code, and the challenging Python builtin identifier swap benchmark (Miceli-Barone et al., 2023), showing that whereas modern LLMs still struggle with this benchmark, our approach yields substantial improvements.
  We release the code needed to replicate the experiments, as well as the generated synthetic data, which can be used to fine-tune LLMs.

Summary: 
The article introduces two new test-time fine-tuning methods to enhance uncertain model predictions without needing additional data. Instead of simply choosing the most likely class during inference, the methods incorporate a focus on likely classes and use single-step gradient descent to adjust predictions for high uncertainty cases. This helps align predictions with the goal of assigning lower probability to less plausible outcomes. The theoretical discussion explores the impact of shared and non-shared features among focus classes. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy on samples with high decision uncertainty across a variety of models in text and image domains, using the same hyperparameters. <div>

Abstract: We propose two novel test-time fine-tuning methods to improve uncertain model predictions. Our methods require no auxiliary data and use the given test instance only. Instead of performing a greedy selection of the most likely class to make a prediction, we introduce an additional focus on the likely classes step during inference. By applying a single-step gradient descent, we refine predictions when an initial forward pass indicates high uncertainty. This aligns predictions more closely with the ideal of assigning zero probability to less plausible outcomes. Our theoretical discussion provides a deeper understanding highlighting the impact on shared and non-shared features among (focus) classes. The experimental evaluation highlights accuracy gains on samples exhibiting high decision uncertainty for a diverse set of models from both the text and image domain using the same hyperparameters.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the double regularized second-order latent factor (DRSLF) model as a novel approach for improving Quality-of-Service (QoS) prediction accuracy in cloud service selection. By integrating L1-norm and L2-norm regularization terms, the DRSLF model enhances the low-rank representation performance of high-dimensional and incomplete QoS matrices. Additionally, the model incorporates second-order information by calculating the Hessian-vector product in each conjugate gradient step. Experimental results on real-world response-time QoS datasets show that the DRSLF model outperforms two baseline models in terms of low-rank representation capability, highlighting its efficacy in addressing the challenges of QoS data analysis in cloud service selection.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-of-Service (QoS) data plays a crucial role in cloud service selection. Since users cannot access all services, QoS can be represented by a high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) matrix. Latent factor analysis (LFA) models have been proven effective as low-rank representation techniques for addressing this issue. However, most LFA models rely on first-order optimizers and use L2-norm regularization, which can lead to lower QoS prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a double regularized second-order latent factor (DRSLF) model with two key ideas: a) integrating L1-norm and L2-norm regularization terms to enhance the low-rank representation performance; b) incorporating second-order information by calculating the Hessian-vector product in each conjugate gradient step. Experimental results on two real-world response-time QoS datasets demonstrate that DRSLF has a higher low-rank representation capability than two baselines.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF) for learning representations from multi-dimensional time series data with low training data availability. This framework incorporates a contrastive loss optimization that induces similarity learning and class-awareness into the representations learned by the tensor factorization module. It also utilizes an ITA module to generate targeted augmentations that highlight intra-class patterns in the data, enabling the recognition of complex intra-class variations. By intelligently mixing patterns between class prototypes and query samples, the ITA-CTF method improves classification performance by up to 18.7% compared to standard tensor factorization and deep learning benchmarks. The proposed approach shows promise in effectively capturing cross-dimensional dependencies and intra-class variations in real-world systems with limited training data. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification of multi-dimensional time series from real-world systems require fine-grained learning of complex features such as cross-dimensional dependencies and intra-class variations-all under the practical challenge of low training data availability. However, standard deep learning (DL) struggles to learn generalizable features in low-data environments due to model overfitting. We propose a versatile yet data-efficient framework, Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF), to learn effective representations from multi-dimensional time series. The CTF module learns core explanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal factors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard tensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss optimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt representations for better classification performance. To strengthen this contrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but informative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the original data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by dynamically sampling a "soft" class prototype to guide the warping of each query data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently pattern-mixed between the "soft" class prototype and the query sample. These augmentations enable the CTF module to recognize complex intra-class variations despite the limited original training data, and seek out invariant class-wise properties for accurate classification performance. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on five different classification tasks. Compared to standard TF and several DL benchmarks, notable performance improvements up to 18.7% were achieved.

Summary:
This study introduces a new task in social media analysis aimed at estimating specific stressors from users' posts. Traditional classification methods have limitations due to the diversity and evolving nature of stressors. The proposed meta-learning based framework utilizes a meta-knowledge inheritance mechanism to effectively estimate stressors with few examples. This approach not only generalizes well to new stressors but also prevents catastrophic forgetting when adapting to them. The experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, a social media-based stressor estimation dataset has been constructed and made public to train AI models for improving human well-being. The dataset is available on Kaggle and Hugging Face platforms.  <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Stress haunts people in modern society, which may cause severe health issues if left unattended. With social media becoming an integral part of daily life, leveraging social media to detect stress has gained increasing attention. While the majority of the work focuses on classifying stress states and stress categories, this study introduce a new task aimed at estimating more specific stressors (like exam, writing paper, etc.) through users' posts on social media. Unfortunately, the diversity of stressors with many different classes but a few examples per class, combined with the consistent arising of new stressors over time, hinders the machine understanding of stressors. To this end, we cast the stressor estimation problem within a practical scenario few-shot learning setting, and propose a novel meta-learning based stressor estimation framework that is enhanced by a meta-knowledge inheritance mechanism. This model can not only learn generic stressor context through meta-learning, but also has a good generalization ability to estimate new stressors with little labeled data. A fundamental breakthrough in our approach lies in the inclusion of the meta-knowledge inheritance mechanism, which equips our model with the ability to prevent catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new stressors. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with the baselines. Additionally, we construct a social media-based stressor estimation dataset that can help train artificial intelligence models to facilitate human well-being. The dataset is now public at \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xinwangcs/stressor-cause-of-mental-health-problem-dataset}{\underline{Kaggle}} and \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/XinWangcs/Stressor}{\underline{Hugging Face}}.

Summary: Inverse problems in nuclear fusion and high-energy astrophysics involve large uncertainties and high-dimensional parameter spaces. This paper suggests using Monte Carlo sampling with dimensionality reduction techniques to analyze these problems but highlights the need for ensuring the resulting parameter combinations are physically valid. The proposed hybrid approach combines formal verification methods for numerical algorithms to restrict parameter spaces with provably correct mathematical and physical properties. By considering experimental uncertainties and uncertainties in physical models, this approach aims to optimize tokamak reactor geometries and infer black hole parameters accurately. This strategy offers a way to balance mathematical consistency with respect to physical reality in solving complex inverse problems. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: Many inverse problems in nuclear fusion and high-energy astrophysics research, such as the optimization of tokamak reactor geometries or the inference of black hole parameters from interferometric images, necessitate high-dimensional parameter scans and large ensembles of simulations to be performed. Such inverse problems typically involve large uncertainties, both in the measurement parameters being inverted and in the underlying physics models themselves. Monte Carlo sampling, when combined with modern non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques such as autoencoders and manifold learning, can be used to reduce the size of the parameter spaces considerably. However, there is no guarantee that the resulting combinations of parameters will be physically valid, or even mathematically consistent. In this position paper, we advocate adopting a hybrid approach that leverages our recent advances in the development of formal verification methods for numerical algorithms, with the goal of constructing parameter space restrictions with provable mathematical and physical correctness properties, whilst nevertheless respecting both experimental uncertainties and uncertainties in the underlying physical processes.

Abstract: Tensor networks, a class of variational quantum many-body wave functions have attracted considerable research interest across many disciplines, including classical machine learning. Recently, Aizpurua et al. demonstrated explainable anomaly detection with matrix product states on a discrete-valued cyber-security task, using quantum-inspired methods to gain insight into the learned model and detected anomalies. Here, we extend this framework to real-valued data domains. We furthermore introduce tree tensor networks for the task of explainable anomaly detection. We demonstrate these methods with three benchmark problems, show adequate predictive performance compared to several baseline models and both tensor network architectures' ability to explain anomalous samples. We thereby extend the application of tensor networks to a broader class of potential problems and open a pathway for future extensions to more complex tensor network architectures.

<div> feature selection, neural network training, automatic clustering, Gaussian noise, machine learning

Summary:
This article introduces a novel feature selection layer for neural networks that automatically identifies and selects the most informative features during training. The layer operates by applying a simple mathematical formula that induces a clustering effect, driving some gains to select informative features and discarding redundant ones through noise distortion and gain normalization. Despite its simplicity, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark and real-world datasets without the need for hyperparameter search or retraining. Theoretical analysis in linear regression further supports its effectiveness, demonstrating that simplicity and performance can coexist in feature selection for machine learning. <div>

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in data-driven applications, reducing input dimensionality to enhance learning accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Existing state-of-the-art methods often require post-selection retraining and extensive hyperparameter tuning, complicating their adoption. We introduce a novel, non-intrusive feature selection layer that, given a target feature count $k$, automatically identifies and selects the $k$ most informative features during neural network training. Our method is uniquely simple, requiring no alterations to the loss function, network architecture, or post-selection retraining. The layer is mathematically elegant and can be fully described by: \begin{align} \nonumber \tilde{x}_i = a_i x_i + (1-a_i)z_i \end{align} where $x_i$ is the input feature, $\tilde{x}_i$ the output, $z_i$ a Gaussian noise, and $a_i$ trainable gain such that $\sum_i{a_i^2}=k$. This formulation induces an automatic clustering effect, driving $k$ of the $a_i$ gains to $1$ (selecting informative features) and the rest to $0$ (discarding redundant ones) via weighted noise distortion and gain normalization. Despite its extreme simplicity, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets and a novel real-world dataset, outperforming or matching existing approaches without requiring hyperparameter search for $k$ or retraining. Theoretical analysis in the context of linear regression further validates its efficacy. Our work demonstrates that simplicity and performance are not mutually exclusive, offering a powerful yet straightforward tool for feature selection in machine learning.

Abstract: When solving optimization problems under uncertainty with contextual data, utilizing machine learning to predict the uncertain parameters is a popular and effective approach. Decision-focused learning (DFL) aims at learning a predictive model such that decision quality, instead of prediction accuracy, is maximized. Common practice here is to predict a single value for each uncertain parameter, implicitly assuming that there exists a (single-scenario) deterministic problem approximation (proxy) that is sufficient to obtain an optimal decision. Other work assumes the opposite, where the underlying distribution needs to be estimated. However, little is known about when either choice is valid. This paper investigates for the first time problem properties that justify using either assumption. Using this, we present effective decision proxies for DFL, with very limited compromise on the complexity of the learning task. We show the effectiveness of presented approaches in experiments on problems with continuous and discrete variables, as well as uncertainty in the objective function and in the constraints.

<div> FlowRec, hierarchical forecasting, reconciliation, network flow optimization, structured relationships
<br>
Summary: FlowRec introduces a new method for hierarchical forecasting reconciliation, addressing the issue of ensuring structural relationships between forecast values in a hierarchy. It reformulates reconciliation as a network flow optimization, allowing forecasting on generalized network structures. It proves polynomial-time solvability for certain loss functions and achieves significantly improved complexity over existing methods. FlowRec extends previous approaches to handle general networks and dynamic scenarios, providing efficient updates with optimality guarantees. It also offers error-bounded approximate reconciliation for time-critical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowRec improves accuracy, runtime, and memory usage, making it a powerful tool for large-scale hierarchical forecasting applications. 
<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical forecasting with reconciliation requires forecasting values of a hierarchy (e.g.~customer demand in a state and district), such that forecast values are linked (e.g.~ district forecasts should add up to the state forecast). Basic forecasting provides no guarantee for these desired structural relationships. Reconciliation addresses this problem, which is crucial for organizations requiring coherent predictions across multiple aggregation levels. Current methods like minimum trace (MinT) are mostly limited to tree structures and are computationally expensive. We introduce FlowRec, which reformulates hierarchical forecast reconciliation as a network flow optimization, enabling forecasting on generalized network structures. While reconciliation under the $\ell_0$ norm is NP-hard, we prove polynomial-time solvability for all $\ell_{p > 0}$ norms and , for any strictly convex and continuously differentiable loss function. For sparse networks, FlowRec achieves $O(n^2\log n)$ complexity, significantly improving upon MinT's $O(n^3)$. Furthermore, we prove that FlowRec extends MinT to handle general networks, replacing MinT's error-covariance estimation step with direct network structural information. A key novelty of our approach is its handling of dynamic scenarios: while traditional methods recompute both base forecasts and reconciliation, FlowRec provides efficient localised updates with optimality guarantees. Monotonicity ensures that when forecasts improve incrementally, the initial reconciliation remains optimal. We also establish efficient, error-bounded approximate reconciliation, enabling fast updates in time-critical applications. Experiments on both simulated and real benchmarks demonstrate that FlowRec improves accuracy, runtime by 3-40x and memory usage by 5-7x. These results establish FlowRec as a powerful tool for large-scale hierarchical forecasting applications.

Summary:
Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for discovering interpretable mathematical expressions. The updated version of SRBench expands the benchmark by including more methods, refining evaluation metrics, and using improved visualizations. Trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and energy consumption are analyzed, showing that no single algorithm dominates across all datasets. A call for action is made to maintain and evolve SRBench as a living benchmark for symbolic regression. Standardizing hyperparameter tuning, execution constraints, and resource allocation is proposed, along with deprecation criteria and best practices for improving SR algorithms such as adaptive hyperparameter tuning and energy-efficient implementations. <div>

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for discovering interpretable mathematical expressions. However, benchmarking SR methods remains challenging due to the diversity of algorithms, datasets, and evaluation criteria. In this work, we present an updated version of SRBench. Our benchmark expands the previous one by nearly doubling the number of evaluated methods, refining evaluation metrics, and using improved visualizations of the results to understand the performances. Additionally, we analyze trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and energy consumption. Our results show that no single algorithm dominates across all datasets. We propose a call for action from SR community in maintaining and evolving SRBench as a living benchmark that reflects the state-of-the-art in symbolic regression, by standardizing hyperparameter tuning, execution constraints, and computational resource allocation. We also propose deprecation criteria to maintain the benchmark's relevance and discuss best practices for improving SR algorithms, such as adaptive hyperparameter tuning and energy-efficient implementations.

Summary:
Statistical methods like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) have traditionally been used to estimate parameters of stochastic differential equations. However, the rise of deep learning technology has led to the exploration of alternative models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for parameter estimation. This study compares the accuracy and computational efficiency of MLE and RNN in estimating parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a commonly used model for probabilistic events like stock prices and temperature fluctuations. Through a series of experiments, the researchers evaluate the performance of both approaches. The results aim to shed light on the potential of leveraging deep learning models in improving parameter estimation in stochastic differential equations. <div>

While statistical methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Kalman Filtering, Inverse Variable Method, and more have historically been used to estimate the parameters of stochastic differential equations, the recent explosion of deep learning technology suggests that models such as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) could produce more precise estimators. We present a series of experiments that compare the estimation accuracy and computational expensiveness of a statistical method (MLE) with a deep learning model (RNN) for the parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

<br>
Autospeculative decoding is introduced as an extension of the speculative decoding algorithm to DDPMs, eliminating the need for auxiliary draft models. The theoretical analysis reveals that Autospeculative Decoding achieves a significant parallel runtime speedup of $\tilde{O} (K^{\frac{1}{3}})$ over the sequential DDPM. By leveraging the connection between DDPMs and Stochastic Localization, the study demonstrates that the increments of DDPM satisfy an exchangeability property, facilitating the application of performance optimization techniques from autoregressive models to the diffusion setting. This near-black-box adaptation enables efficient inference-time optimizations in DDPMs. Practical implementation of Autospeculative Decoding shows notable acceleration of DDPM inference in various domains.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling. However, their sequential computation requirements lead to significant inference-time bottlenecks. In this work, we utilize the connection between DDPMs and Stochastic Localization to prove that, under an appropriate reparametrization, the increments of DDPM satisfy an exchangeability property. This general insight enables near-black-box adaptation of various performance optimization techniques from autoregressive models to the diffusion setting. To demonstrate this, we introduce \emph{Autospeculative Decoding} (ASD), an extension of the widely used speculative decoding algorithm to DDPMs that does not require any auxiliary draft models. Our theoretical analysis shows that ASD achieves a $\tilde{O} (K^{\frac{1}{3}})$ parallel runtime speedup over the $K$ step sequential DDPM. We also demonstrate that a practical implementation of autospeculative decoding accelerates DDPM inference significantly in various domains.

Abstract: Evaluating machine learning models is crucial not only for determining their technical accuracy but also for assessing their potential societal implications. While the potential for low-sample-size bias in algorithms is well known, we demonstrate the significance of sample-size bias induced by combinatorics in classification metrics. This revelation challenges the efficacy of these metrics in assessing bias with high resolution, especially when comparing groups of disparate sizes, which frequently arise in social applications. We provide analyses of the bias that appears in several commonly applied metrics and propose a model-agnostic assessment and correction technique. Additionally, we analyze counts of undefined cases in metric calculations, which can lead to misleading evaluations if improperly handled. This work illuminates the previously unrecognized challenge of combinatorics and probability in standard evaluation practices and thereby advances approaches for performing fair and trustworthy classification methods.

Summary:
This study examines the training of Transformer-based language models on algorithmic tasks and identifies pronounced phase transitions in their loss curves. Unlike expected power-law scaling trends, the models show minimal improvement in validation loss over large compute ranges, followed by a sudden drop. Internal representation analysis reveals the learning of quiet features before the acquisition of loud features, coinciding with the loss decrease. Ablation experiments demonstrate that disrupting a single learned feature significantly impairs performance, indicating their causal role. The findings challenge the assumption that next-token predictive loss directly reflects progress and suggest that critical internal features may develop discreetly before driving rapid performance gains. <div>
arXiv:2505.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We train Transformer-based language models on ten foundational algorithmic tasks and observe pronounced phase transitions in their loss curves that deviate from established power-law scaling trends. Over large ranges of compute, the validation loss barely improves, then abruptly decreases. Probing the models' internal representations reveals the learning of quiet features during the stagnant phase, followed by sudden acquisition of loud features that coincide with the sharp drop in loss. Our ablation experiments show that disrupting a single learned feature can dramatically degrade performance, providing evidence of their causal role in task performance. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that next-token predictive loss reliably tracks incremental progress; instead, key internal features may be developing below the surface until they coalesce, triggering a rapid performance gain.

Research has focused on understanding the scaling laws of hyper-parameters like weight decay and learning rate under muon. However, at larger scales, an issue arises with the iterative orthogonalization procedure in muon due to shrinking singular values of random matrices.

Abstract: The muon optimizer has picked up much attention as of late as a possible replacement to the seemingly omnipresent Adam optimizer. Recently, care has been taken to document the scaling laws of hyper-parameters under muon such as weight decay and learning rate. However, at much larger scales the iterative orthogonalization procedure present in muon may suffer a possible issue as the singular values of random matrices shrink with scale. This paper shows this scaling behavior theoretically and empirically on random matrices but does not suggest what to do about it.

arXiv:2505.04046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, trustworthy multi-view learning has attracted extensive attention because evidence learning can provide reliable uncertainty estimation to enhance the credibility of multi-view predictions. Existing trusted multi-view learning methods implicitly assume that multi-view data is secure. In practice, however, in safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and security monitoring, multi-view data often faces threats from adversarial perturbations, thereby deceiving or disrupting multi-view learning models. This inevitably leads to the adversarial unreliability problem (AUP) in trusted multi-view learning. To overcome this tricky problem, we propose a novel multi-view learning framework, namely Reliable Disentanglement Multi-view Learning (RDML). Specifically, we first propose evidential disentanglement learning to decompose each view into clean and adversarial parts under the guidance of corresponding evidences, which is extracted by a pretrained evidence extractor. Then, we employ the feature recalibration module to mitigate the negative impact of adversarial perturbations and extract potential informative features from them. Finally, to further ignore the irreparable adversarial interferences, a view-level evidential attention mechanism is designed. Extensive experiments on multi-view classification tasks with adversarial attacks show that our RDML outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-view learning methods by a relatively large margin.

Abstract: We introduce LlamaPIE, the first real-time proactive assistant designed to enhance human conversations through discreet, concise guidance delivered via hearable devices. Unlike traditional language models that require explicit user invocation, this assistant operates in the background, anticipating user needs without interrupting conversations. We address several challenges, including determining when to respond, crafting concise responses that enhance conversations, leveraging knowledge of the user for context-aware assistance, and real-time, on-device processing. To achieve this, we construct a semi-synthetic dialogue dataset and propose a two-model pipeline: a small model that decides when to respond and a larger model that generates the response. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing helpful, unobtrusive assistance. User studies with our assistant, implemented on Apple Silicon M2 hardware, show a strong preference for the proactive assistant over both a baseline with no assistance and a reactive model, highlighting the potential of LlamaPie to enhance live conversations.

Abstract: This paper examines whether large language model (LLM) capabilities can continue to advance without additional compute by analyzing the development and role of algorithms used in state-of-the-art LLMs. Motivated by regulatory efforts that have largely focused on restricting access to high-performance hardware, we ask: Can LLMs progress in a compute-constrained environment, and how do algorithmic innovations perform under such conditions?
  To address these questions, we introduce a novel classification framework that distinguishes between compute-dependent innovations -- which yield disproportionate benefits at high compute levels (e.g., the Transformer architecture and mixture-of-experts models) and compute-independent innovations, which improve efficiency across all compute scales (e.g., rotary positional encoding, FlashAttention, or layer normalization). We quantify these contributions using a metric called compute-equivalent gain (CEG), which estimates the additional compute that would be required to achieve similar improvements without these algorithmic advancements.
  To validate this framework, we conduct small-scale training experiments with a scaled-down GPT-2 model. Our results confirm that compute-independent advancements yield meaningful performance gains even in resource-constrained settings, with a CEG of up to $3.5\times$ over a baseline model. By contrast, compute-dependent advancements provided little benefit or even degraded performance at the small scale, reinforcing the importance of compute availability for certain algorithmic gains.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a potent class of neural networks capable of leveraging the connectivity and structure of real-world graphs to learn intricate properties and relationships between nodes. Many real-world graphs exceed the memory capacity of a GPU due to their sheer size, and using GNNs on them requires techniques such as mini-batch sampling to scale. However, this can lead to reduced accuracy in some cases, and sampling and data transfer from the CPU to the GPU can also slow down training. On the other hand, distributed full-graph training suffers from high communication overhead and load imbalance due to the irregular structure of graphs. We propose Plexus, a three-dimensional (3D) parallel approach for full-graph training that tackles these issues and scales to billion-edge graphs. Additionally, we introduce optimizations such as a permutation scheme for load balancing, and a performance model to predict the optimal 3D configuration. We evaluate Plexus on several graph datasets and show scaling results for up to 2048 GPUs on Perlmutter, which is 33% of the machine, and 2048 GCDs on Frontier. Plexus achieves unprecedented speedups of 2.3x-12.5x over existing methods and a reduction in the time to solution by 5.2-8.7x on Perlmutter and 7-54.2x on Frontier.

Abstract: This position paper argues that achieving meaningful scientific and societal advances with artificial intelligence (AI) requires a responsible, application-driven approach (RAD) to AI research. As AI is increasingly integrated into society, AI researchers must engage with the specific contexts where AI is being applied. This includes being responsive to ethical and legal considerations, technical and societal constraints, and public discourse. We present the case for RAD-AI to drive research through a three-staged approach: (1) building transdisciplinary teams and people-centred studies; (2) addressing context-specific methods, ethical commitments, assumptions, and metrics; and (3) testing and sustaining efficacy through staged testbeds and a community of practice. We present a vision for the future of application-driven AI research to unlock new value through technically feasible methods that are adaptive to the contextual needs and values of the communities they ultimately serve.

Abstract: This study presents a novel benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) using challenges derived from the Financial Modeling World Cup (FMWC) Excel competitions. We introduce a methodology for converting 113 existing FMWC challenges into programmatically evaluable JSON formats and use this dataset to compare the performance of several leading LLMs. Our findings demonstrate significant variations in performance across different challenge categories, with models showing specific strengths in pattern recognition tasks but struggling with complex numerical reasoning. The benchmark provides a standardized framework for assessing LLM capabilities in realistic business-oriented tasks rather than abstract academic problems. This research contributes to the growing field of AI benchmarking by establishing proficiency among the 1.5 billion people who daily use Microsoft Excel as a meaningful evaluation metric that bridges the gap between academic AI benchmarks and practical business applications.

<title>LHT: Statistically-Driven Oblique Decision Trees for Interpretable Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04139</link>

arXiv:2505.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Learning Hyperplane Tree (LHT), a novel oblique decision tree model designed for expressive and interpretable classification. LHT fundamentally distinguishes itself through a non-iterative, statistically-driven approach to constructing splitting hyperplanes. Unlike methods that rely on iterative optimization or heuristics, LHT directly computes the hyperplane parameters, which are derived from feature weights based on the differences in feature expectations between classes within each node. This deterministic mechanism enables a direct and well-defined hyperplane construction process. Predictions leverage a unique piecewise linear membership function within leaf nodes, obtained via local least-squares fitting. We formally analyze the convergence of the LHT splitting process, ensuring that each split yields meaningful, non-empty partitions. Furthermore, we establish that the time complexity for building an LHT up to depth $d$ is $O(mnd)$, demonstrating the practical feasibility of constructing trees with powerful oblique splits using this methodology. The explicit feature weighting at each split provides inherent interpretability. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate LHT's competitive accuracy, positioning it as a practical, theoretically grounded, and interpretable alternative in the landscape of tree-based models. The implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/Hongyi-Li-sz/LHT_model.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial across various industries, where accurate extraction of complex periodic and trend components can significantly enhance prediction performance. However, existing models often struggle to capture these intricate patterns. To address these challenges, we propose FilterTS, a novel forecasting model that utilizes specialized filtering techniques based on the frequency domain. FilterTS introduces a Dynamic Cross-Variable Filtering Module, a key innovation that dynamically leverages other variables as filters to extract and reinforce shared variable frequency components across variables in multivariate time series. Additionally, a Static Global Filtering Module captures stable frequency components, identified throughout the entire training set. Moreover, the model is built in the frequency domain, converting time-domain convolutions into frequency-domain multiplicative operations to enhance computational efficiency. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that FilterTS significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Globally, the outbreaks of infectious diseases have exerted an extremely profound and severe influence on health security and the economy. During the critical phases of epidemics, devising effective intervention measures poses a significant challenge to both the academic and practical arenas. There is numerous research based on reinforcement learning to optimize intervention measures of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, most of these efforts have been confined within the differential equation based on infectious disease models. Although a limited number of studies have incorporated reinforcement learning methodologies into individual-based infectious disease models, the models employed therein have entailed simplifications and limitations, rendering it incapable of modeling the complexity and dynamics inherent in infectious disease transmission. We establish a decision-making framework based on an individual agent-based transmission model, utilizing reinforcement learning to continuously explore and develop a strategy function. The framework's validity is verified through both experimental and theoretical approaches. Covasim, a detailed and widely used agent-based disease transmission model, was modified to support reinforcement learning research. We conduct an exhaustive exploration of the application efficacy of multiple algorithms across diverse action spaces. Furthermore, we conduct an innovative preliminary theoretical analysis concerning the issue of "time coverage". The results of the experiment robustly validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the methodological framework of this study. The coping strategies gleaned therefrom prove highly efficacious in suppressing the expansion of the epidemic scale and safeguarding the stability of the economic system, thereby providing crucial reference perspectives for the formulation of global public health security strategies.

Abstract: Time series forecasting uses historical data to predict future trends, leveraging the relationships between past observations and available features. In this paper, we propose RAFT, a retrieval-augmented time series forecasting method to provide sufficient inductive biases and complement the model's learning capacity. When forecasting the subsequent time frames, we directly retrieve historical data candidates from the training dataset with patterns most similar to the input, and utilize the future values of these candidates alongside the inputs to obtain predictions. This simple approach augments the model's capacity by externally providing information about past patterns via retrieval modules. Our empirical evaluations on ten benchmark datasets show that RAFT consistently outperforms contemporary baselines with an average win ratio of 86%.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in real-world applications across many fields, where varying sensor frequencies and asynchronous measurements pose significant modeling challenges. Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.

Abstract: Recent advancements in layout pattern generation have been dominated by deep generative models. However, relying solely on neural networks for legality guarantees raises concerns in many practical applications. In this paper, we present \tool{DiffPattern}-Flex, a novel approach designed to generate reliable layout patterns efficiently. \tool{DiffPattern}-Flex incorporates a new method for generating diverse topologies using a discrete diffusion model while maintaining a lossless and compute-efficient layout representation. To ensure legal pattern generation, we employ {an} optimization-based, white-box pattern assessment process based on specific design rules. Furthermore, fast sampling and efficient legalization technologies are employed to accelerate the generation process. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that \tool{DiffPattern}-Flex significantly outperforms existing methods and excels at producing reliable layout patterns.

Abstract: Wireless roaming is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.

Abstract: Simplicity is a critical inductive bias for designing data-driven controllers, especially when robustness is important. Despite the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning in complex control tasks, it is prone to capturing intricate and spurious correlations between observations and actions, leading to failure under slight perturbations to the environment. To tackle this problem, in this work we introduce a novel inductive bias towards simple policies in reinforcement learning. The simplicity inductive bias is introduced by minimizing the entropy of entire action trajectories, corresponding to the number of bits required to describe information in action trajectories after the agent observes state trajectories. Our reinforcement learning agent, Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning, is optimized to minimize the trajectory entropy while maximizing rewards. We show that the trajectory entropy can be effectively estimated by learning a variational parameterized action prediction model, and use the prediction model to construct an information-regularized reward function. Furthermore, we construct a practical algorithm that enables the joint optimization of models, including the policy and the prediction model. Experimental evaluations on several high-dimensional locomotion tasks show that our learned policies produce more cyclical and consistent action trajectories, and achieve superior performance, and robustness to noise and dynamic changes than the state-of-the-art.

<title>A Large Language Model for Feasible and Diverse Population Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Generating a synthetic population that is both feasible and diverse is crucial for ensuring the validity of downstream activity schedule simulation in activity-based models (ABMs). While deep generative models (DGMs), such as variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, have been applied to this task, they often struggle to balance the inclusion of rare but plausible combinations (i.e., sampling zeros) with the exclusion of implausible ones (i.e., structural zeros). To improve feasibility while maintaining diversity, we propose a fine-tuning method for large language models (LLMs) that explicitly controls the autoregressive generation process through topological orderings derived from a Bayesian Network (BN). Experimental results show that our hybrid LLM-BN approach outperforms both traditional DGMs and proprietary LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-4o) with few-shot learning. Specifically, our approach achieves approximately 95% feasibility, significantly higher than the ~80% observed in DGMs, while maintaining comparable diversity, making it well-suited for practical applications. Importantly, the method is based on a lightweight open-source LLM, enabling fine-tuning and inference on standard personal computing environments. This makes the approach cost-effective and scalable for large-scale applications, such as synthesizing populations in megacities, without relying on expensive infrastructure. By initiating the ABM pipeline with high-quality synthetic populations, our method improves overall simulation reliability and reduces downstream error propagation. The source code for these methods is available for research and practical application.

<title>Estimating Causal Effects in Networks with Cluster-Based Bandits</title>

Abstract: The gold standard for estimating causal effects is randomized controlled trial (RCT) or A/B testing where a random group of individuals from a population of interest are given treatment and the outcome is compared to a random group of individuals from the same population. However, A/B testing is challenging in the presence of interference, commonly occurring in social networks, where individuals can impact each others outcome. Moreover, A/B testing can incur a high performance loss when one of the treatment arms has a poor performance and the test continues to treat individuals with it. Therefore, it is important to design a strategy that can adapt over time and efficiently learn the total treatment effect in the network. We introduce two cluster-based multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms to gradually estimate the total treatment effect in a network while maximizing the expected reward by making a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We compare the performance of our MAB algorithms with a vanilla MAB algorithm that ignores clusters and the corresponding RCT methods on semi-synthetic data with simulated interference. The vanilla MAB algorithm shows higher reward-action ratio at the cost of higher treatment effect error due to undesired spillover. The cluster-based MAB algorithms show higher reward-action ratio compared to their corresponding RCT methods without sacrificing much accuracy in treatment effect estimation.

Abstract: Cybersecurity has become essential worldwide and at all levels, concerning individuals, institutions, and governments. A basic principle in cybersecurity is to be always alert. Therefore, automation is imperative in processes where the volume of daily operations is large. Several cybersecurity applications can be addressed as binary classification problems, including anomaly detection, fraud detection, intrusion detection, spam detection, or malware detection. We present three experiments. In the first experiment, we evaluate single classifiers including Random Forests, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree. In the second experiment, we test different sampling techniques including over-sampling, under-sampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, and Self-Paced Ensembling. In the last experiment, we evaluate Self-Paced Ensembling and its number of base classifiers. We found that imbalance learning techniques had positive and negative effects, as reported in related studies. Thus, these techniques should be applied with caution. Besides, we found different best performers for each dataset. Therefore, we recommend testing single classifiers and imbalance learning techniques for each new dataset and application involving imbalanced datasets as is the case in several cyber security applications.

<title>FRAIN to Train: A Fast-and-Reliable Solution for Decentralized Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data locality. Although FedAvg pioneered synchronous rounds for global model averaging, slower devices can delay collective progress. Asynchronous FL (e.g., FedAsync) addresses stragglers by continuously integrating client updates, yet naive implementations risk client drift due to non-IID data and stale contributions. Some Blockchain-based FL approaches (e.g., BRAIN) employ robust weighting or scoring of updates to resist malicious or misaligned proposals. However, performance drops can still persist under severe data heterogeneity or high staleness, and synchronization overhead has emerged as a new concern due to its aggregator-free architectures.
  We introduce Fast-and-Reliable AI Network, FRAIN, a new asynchronous FL method that mitigates these limitations by incorporating two key ideas. First, our FastSync strategy eliminates the need to replay past model versions, enabling newcomers and infrequent participants to efficiently approximate the global model. Second, we adopt spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) when merging parameters, preserving models' directions and alleviating destructive interference from divergent local training.
  Experiments with a CNN image-classification model and a Transformer-based language model demonstrate that FRAIN achieves more stable and robust convergence than FedAvg, FedAsync, and BRAIN, especially under harsh environments: non-IID data distributions, networks that experience delays and require frequent re-synchronization, and the presence of malicious nodes.

Abstract: We develop a novel physics informed deep learning approach for solving nonlinear drift-diffusion equations on metric graphs. These models represent an important model class with a large number of applications in areas ranging from transport in biological cells to the motion of human crowds. While traditional numerical schemes require a large amount of tailoring, especially in the case of model design or parameter identification problems, physics informed deep operator networks (DeepONet) have emerged as a versatile tool for the solution of partial differential equations with the particular advantage that they easily incorporate parameter identification questions. We here present an approach where we first learn three DeepONet models for representative inflow, inner and outflow edges, resp., and then subsequently couple these models for the solution of the drift-diffusion metric graph problem by relying on an edge-based domain decomposition approach. We illustrate that our framework is applicable for the accurate evaluation of graph-coupled physics models and is well suited for solving optimization or inverse problems on these coupled networks.

Abstract: Due to the dynamics of underlying physics and external influences, the uncertainty of time series often varies over time. However, existing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) often fail to capture this non-stationary nature, constrained by their constant variance assumption from the additive noise model (ANM). In this paper, we innovatively utilize the Location-Scale Noise Model (LSNM) to relax the fixed uncertainty assumption of ANM. A diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, termed Non-stationary Diffusion (NsDiff), is designed based on LSNM that is capable of modeling the changing pattern of uncertainty. Specifically, NsDiff combines a denoising diffusion-based conditional generative model with a pre-trained conditional mean and variance estimator, enabling adaptive endpoint distribution modeling. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware noise schedule, which dynamically adjusts the noise levels to accurately reflect the data uncertainty at each step and integrates the time-varying variances into the diffusion process. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NsDiff compared to existing approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/wwy155/NsDiff.

Abstract: As the adoption of deep learning models has grown beyond human capacity for verification, meta-algorithms are needed to ensure reliable model inference. Concept drift detection is a field dedicated to identifying statistical shifts that is underutilized in monitoring neural networks that may encounter inference data with distributional characteristics diverging from their training data. Given the wide variety of model architectures, applications, and datasets, it is important that concept drift detection algorithms are adaptable to different inference scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an application of the $\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Hypothesis Test as a drift detection meta-algorithm applied to a multilayer perceptron, a convolutional neural network, and a transformer trained for machine vision as they are exposed to simulated drift during inference. To that end, we demonstrate how unexpected drops in accuracy due to concept drift can be detected without directly examining the inference outputs. Our approach enhances safety by ensuring models are continually evaluated for reliability across varying conditions.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms play a pivotal role in unsupervised learning by identifying and grouping similar objects based on shared characteristics. While traditional clustering techniques, such as hard and fuzzy center-based clustering, have been widely used, they struggle with complex, high-dimensional, and non-Euclidean datasets. In particular, the Fuzzy $C$-Means (FCM) algorithm, despite its efficiency and popularity, exhibits notable limitations in non-Euclidean spaces. Euclidean spaces assume linear separability and uniform distance scaling, limiting their effectiveness in capturing complex, hierarchical, or non-Euclidean structures in fuzzy clustering. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Filtration-based Hyperbolic Fuzzy $C$-Means (HypeFCM), a novel clustering algorithm tailored for better representation of data relationships in non-Euclidean spaces. HypeFCM integrates the principles of fuzzy clustering with hyperbolic geometry and employs a weight-based filtering mechanism to improve performance. The algorithm initializes weights using a Dirichlet distribution and iteratively refines cluster centroids and membership assignments based on a hyperbolic metric in the Poincar\'e Disc model. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HypeFCM significantly outperforms conventional fuzzy clustering methods in non-Euclidean settings, underscoring its robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: We propose Riemannian Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (RDDPMs) for learning distributions on submanifolds of Euclidean space that are level sets of functions, including most of the manifolds relevant to applications. Existing methods for generative modeling on manifolds rely on substantial geometric information such as geodesic curves or eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and, as a result, they are limited to manifolds where such information is available. In contrast, our method, built on a projection scheme, can be applied to more general manifolds, as it only requires being able to evaluate the value and the first order derivatives of the function that defines the submanifold. We provide a theoretical analysis of our method in the continuous-time limit, which elucidates the connection between our RDDPMs and score-based generative models on manifolds. The capability of our method is demonstrated on datasets from previous studies and on new datasets sampled from two high-dimensional manifolds, i.e. $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ and the configuration space of molecular system alanine dipeptide with fixed dihedral angle.

Abstract: DBSCAN, a well-known density-based clustering algorithm, has gained widespread popularity and usage due to its effectiveness in identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noisy data. However, it encounters challenges in producing satisfactory cluster results when confronted with datasets of varying density scales, a common scenario in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive and Robust DBSCAN with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning cluster framework, namely AR-DBSCAN. First, we model the initial dataset as a two-level encoding tree and categorize the data vertices into distinct density partitions according to the information uncertainty determined in the encoding tree. Each partition is then assigned to an agent to find the best clustering parameters without manual assistance. The allocation is density-adaptive, enabling AR-DBSCAN to effectively handle diverse density distributions within the dataset by utilizing distinct agents for different partitions. Second, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning guided automatic parameter searching process is designed. The process of adjusting the parameter search direction by perceiving the clustering environment is modeled as a Markov decision process. Using a weakly-supervised reward training policy network, each agent adaptively learns the optimal clustering parameters by interacting with the clusters. Third, a recursive search mechanism adaptable to the data's scale is presented, enabling efficient and controlled exploration of large parameter spaces. Extensive experiments are conducted on nine artificial datasets and a real-world dataset. The results of offline and online tasks show that AR-DBSCAN not only improves clustering accuracy by up to 144.1% and 175.3% in the NMI and ARI metrics, respectively, but also is capable of robustly finding dominant parameters.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HeteGNNs) have demonstrated strong abilities to learn node representations by effectively extracting complex structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. Most of the prevailing HeteGNNs follow the neighborhood aggregation paradigm, leveraging meta-path based message passing to learn latent node representations. However, due to the pairwise nature of meta-paths, these models fail to capture high-order relations among nodes, resulting in suboptimal performance. Additionally, the challenge of ``over-squashing'', where long-range message passing in HeteGNNs leads to severe information distortion, further limits the efficacy of these models. To address these limitations, this paper proposes MGA-HHN, a Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural Network for heterogeneous graph representation learning. MGA-HHN introduces two key innovations: (1) a novel approach for constructing meta-path based heterogeneous hypergraphs that explicitly models higher-order semantic information in heterogeneous graphs through multiple views, and (2) a multi-granular attention mechanism that operates at both the node and hyperedge levels. This mechanism enables the model to capture fine-grained interactions among nodes sharing the same semantic context within a hyperedge type, while preserving the diversity of semantics across different hyperedge types. As such, MGA-HHN effectively mitigates long-range message distortion and generates more expressive node representations. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGA-HHN outperforms state-of-the-art models, showcasing its effectiveness in node classification, node clustering and visualization tasks.

Abstract: Clustering aims to form groups of similar data points in an unsupervised regime. Yet, clustering complex datasets containing critically intertwined shapes poses significant challenges. The prevailing clustering algorithms widely depend on evaluating similarity measures based on Euclidean metrics. Exploring topological characteristics to perform clustering of complex datasets inevitably presents a better scope. The topological clustering algorithms predominantly perceive the point set through the lens of Simplicial complexes and Persistent homology. Despite these approaches, the existing topological clustering algorithms cannot somehow fully exploit topological structures and show inconsistent performances on some highly complicated datasets. This work aims to mitigate the limitations by identifying topologically similar neighbors through the Vietoris-Rips complex and Betti number filtration. In addition, we introduce the concept of the Betti sequences to capture flexibly essential features from the topological structures. Our proposed algorithm is adept at clustering complex, intertwined shapes contained in the datasets. We carried out experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets. Our algorithm demonstrated commendable performances across the datasets compared to some of the well-known topology-based clustering algorithms.

Abstract: The global energy landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, often referred to as the energy transition, driven by the urgent need to mitigate climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and ensure sustainable energy supplies. However, the undoubted complexity of new investments in renewables, as well as the phase out of high CO2-emission energy sources, hampers the pace of the energy transition and raises doubts as to whether new renewable energy sources are capable of solely meeting the climate target goals. This highlights the need to investigate alternative pathways to accelerate the energy transition, by identifying human activity domains with higher/excessive energy demands. Two notable examples where there is room for improvement, in the sense of reducing energy consumption and consequently CO2 emissions, are residential energy consumption and road transport. This dissertation investigates the development of novel Deep Learning techniques to create tools which solve limitations in these two key energy domains. Reduction of residential energy consumption can be achieved by empowering end-users with the user of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring, whereas optimization of EV charging with Deep Reinforcement Learning can tackle road transport decarbonization.

<title>Extending a Quantum Reinforcement Learning Exploration Policy with Flags to Connect Four</title>

Abstract: Action selection based on flags is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) exploration policy that improves the exploration of the state space through the use of flags, which can identify the most promising actions to take in each state. The quantum counterpart of this exploration policy further improves upon this by taking advantage of a quadratic speedup for sampling flagged actions. This approach has already been successfully employed for the game of Checkers. In this work, we describe the application of this method to the context of Connect Four, in order to study its performance in a different setting, which can lead to a better generalization of the technique. We also kept track of a metric that wasn't taken into account in previous work: the average number of iterations to obtain a flagged action. Since going second is a significant disadvantage in Connect Four, we also had the intent of exploring how this more complex scenario would impact the performance of our approach. The experiments involved training and testing classical and quantum RL agents that played either going first or going second against a Randomized Negamax opponent. The results showed that both flagged exploration policies were clearly superior to a simple epsilon-greedy policy. Furthermore, the quantum agents did in fact sample flagged actions in less iterations. Despite obtaining tagged actions more consistently, the win rates between the classical and quantum versions of the approach were identical, which could be due to the simplicity of the training scenario chosen.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in data mining and machine learning, particularly for analyzing large-scale data. In this paper, we introduce Clust-Splitter, an efficient algorithm based on nonsmooth optimization, designed to solve the minimum sum-of-squares clustering problem in very large datasets. The clustering task is approached through a sequence of three nonsmooth optimization problems: two auxiliary problems used to generate suitable starting points, followed by a main clustering formulation. To solve these problems effectively, the limited memory bundle method is combined with an incremental approach to develop the Clust-Splitter algorithm. We evaluate Clust-Splitter on real-world datasets characterized by both a large number of attributes and a large number of data points and compare its performance with several state-of-the-art large-scale clustering algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method for clustering very large datasets, as well as the high quality of its solutions, which are on par with those of the best existing methods.

Abstract: The planning and operation of renewable energy, especially wind power, depend crucially on accurate, timely, and high-resolution weather information. Coarse-grid global numerical weather forecasts are typically downscaled to meet these requirements, introducing challenges of scale inconsistency, process representation error, computation cost, and entanglement of distinct uncertainty sources from chaoticity, model bias, and large-scale forcing. We address these challenges by learning the climatological distribution of a target wind farm using its high-resolution numerical weather simulations. An optimal combination of this learned high-resolution climatological prior with coarse-grid large scale forecasts yields highly accurate, fine-grained, full-variable, large ensemble of weather pattern forecasts. Using observed meteorological records and wind turbine power outputs as references, the proposed methodology verifies advantageously compared to existing numerical/statistical forecasting-downscaling pipelines, regarding either deterministic/probabilistic skills or economic gains. Moreover, a 100-member, 10-day forecast with spatial resolution of 1 km and output frequency of 15 min takes < 1 hour on a moderate-end GPU, as contrast to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ CPU hours for conventional numerical simulation. By drastically reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy, our method paves the way for more efficient and reliable renewable energy planning and operation.

Abstract: Manifold learning aims to discover and represent low-dimensional structures underlying high-dimensional data while preserving critical topological and geometric properties. Existing methods often fail to capture local details with global topological integrity from noisy data or construct a balanced dimensionality reduction, resulting in distorted or fractured embeddings. We present an AutoEncoder-based method that integrates a manifold reconstruction layer, which uncovers latent manifold structures from noisy point clouds, and further provides regularizations on topological and geometric properties during dimensionality reduction, whereas the two components promote each other during training. Experiments on point cloud datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines like t-SNE, UMAP, and Topological AutoEncoders in discovering manifold structures from noisy data and preserving them through dimensionality reduction, as validated by visualization and quantitative metrics. This work demonstrates the significance of combining manifold reconstruction with manifold learning to achieve reliable representation of the latent manifold, particularly when dealing with noisy real-world data.

Abstract: Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art tools for various generative tasks. However, estimating high-dimensional score functions makes them potentially suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). This underscores the importance of better understanding and exploiting low-dimensional structure in the target distribution. In this work, we consider locality structure, which describes sparse dependencies between model components. Under locality structure, the score function is effectively low-dimensional, so that it can be estimated by a localized neural network with significantly reduced sample complexity. This motivates the localized diffusion model, where a localized score matching loss is used to train the score function within a localized hypothesis space. We prove that such localization enables diffusion models to circumvent CoD, at the price of additional localization error. Under realistic sample size scaling, we show both theoretically and numerically that a moderate localization radius can balance the statistical and localization error, leading to a better overall performance. The localized structure also facilitates parallel training of diffusion models, making it potentially more efficient for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed Machine Learning (ML) setup, where a shared model is collaboratively trained by various clients using their local datasets while keeping the data private. Considering resource-constrained devices, FL clients often suffer from restricted transmission capacity. Aiming to enhance the system performance, the communication between clients and server needs to be diminished. Current FL strategies transmit a tremendous amount of data (model weights) within the FL process, which needs a high communication bandwidth. Considering resource constraints, increasing the number of clients and, consequently, the amount of data (model weights) can lead to a bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce the Federated Black Widow Optimization (FedBWO) technique to decrease the amount of transmitted data by transmitting only a performance score rather than the local model weights from clients. FedBWO employs the BWO algorithm to improve local model updates. The conducted experiments prove that FedBWO remarkably improves the performance of the global model and the communication efficiency of the overall system. According to the experimental outcomes, FedBWO enhances the global model accuracy by an average of 21% over FedAvg, and 12% over FedGWO. Furthermore, FedBWO dramatically decreases the communication cost compared to other methods.

<title>Towards Initialization-Agnostic Clustering with Iterative Adaptive Resonance Theory</title>

Abstract: The clustering performance of Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (Fuzzy ART) is highly dependent on the preset vigilance parameter, where deviations in its value can lead to significant fluctuations in clustering results, severely limiting its practicality for non-expert users. Existing approaches generally enhance vigilance parameter robustness through adaptive mechanisms such as particle swarm optimization and fuzzy logic rules. However, they often introduce additional hyperparameters or complex frameworks that contradict the original simplicity of the algorithm. To address this, we propose Iterative Refinement Adaptive Resonance Theory (IR-ART), which integrates three key phases into a unified iterative framework: (1) Cluster Stability Detection: A dynamic stability detection module that identifies unstable clusters by analyzing the change of sample size (number of samples in the cluster) in iteration. (2) Unstable Cluster Deletion: An evolutionary pruning module that eliminates low-quality clusters. (3) Vigilance Region Expansion: A vigilance region expansion mechanism that adaptively adjusts similarity thresholds. Independent of the specific execution of clustering, these three phases sequentially focus on analyzing the implicit knowledge within the iterative process, adjusting weights and vigilance parameters, thereby laying a foundation for the next iteration. Experimental evaluation on 15 datasets demonstrates that IR-ART improves tolerance to suboptimal vigilance parameter values while preserving the parameter simplicity of Fuzzy ART. Case studies visually confirm the algorithm's self-optimization capability through iterative refinement, making it particularly suitable for non-expert users in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising performance on various programming tasks, including Automatic Program Repair (APR). However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.

Abstract: Temporal interaction graphs (TIGs), defined by sequences of timestamped interaction events, have become ubiquitous in real-world applications due to their capability to model complex dynamic system behaviors. As a result, temporal interaction graph representation learning (TIGRL) has garnered significant attention in recent years. TIGRL aims to embed nodes in TIGs into low-dimensional representations that effectively preserve both structural and temporal information, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering within constantly evolving data environments. In this paper, we begin by introducing the foundational concepts of TIGs and emphasize the critical role of temporal dependencies. We then propose a comprehensive taxonomy of state-of-the-art TIGRL methods, systematically categorizing them based on the types of information utilized during the learning process to address the unique challenges inherent to TIGs. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we curate the source of datasets and benchmarks, providing valuable resources for empirical investigations. Finally, we examine key open challenges and explore promising research directions in TIGRL, laying the groundwork for future advancements that have the potential to shape the evolution of this field.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of clustering models is a challenging task where the outcome depends on the definition of what constitutes a cluster. Due to this design, current existing metrics rarely handle multiple clustering models with diverse cluster definitions, nor do they comply with the integration of constraints when available. In this work, we take inspiration from consensus clustering and assume that a set of clustering models is able to uncover hidden structures in the data. We propose to construct a discriminative ordering through ensemble clustering based on the distance between the connectivity of a clustering model and the consensus matrix. We first validate the proposed method with synthetic scenarios, highlighting that the proposed score ranks the models that best match the consensus first. We then show that this simple ranking score significantly outperforms other scoring methods when comparing sets of different clustering algorithms that are not restricted to a fixed number of clusters and is compatible with clustering constraints.

Abstract: This paper introduces the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that addresses the challenge of preserving performance in DP-SGD, where added noise typically degrades model utility. FFTKF integrates frequency-domain noise shaping with Kalman filtering to enhance gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. It employs a high-frequency shaping mask in the Fourier domain to concentrate differential privacy noise in less informative spectral components, preserving low-frequency gradient signals. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. With a per-iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$, FFTKF demonstrates improved test accuracy over DP-SGD and DiSK across MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets using CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis confirms that FFTKF maintains equivalent privacy guarantees while achieving a tighter privacy-utility trade-off through reduced noise and controlled bias.

Abstract: Many conservative physical systems can be described using the Hamiltonian formalism. A notable example is the Vlasov-Poisson equations, a set of partial differential equations that govern the time evolution of a phase-space density function representing collisionless particles under a self-consistent potential. These equations play a central role in both plasma physics and cosmology. Due to the complexity of the potential involved, analytical solutions are rarely available, necessitating the use of numerical methods such as Particle-In-Cell. In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on Hamiltonian-informed Normalizing Flows, specifically a variant of Fixed-Kinetic Neural Hamiltonian Flows. Our method transforms an initial Gaussian distribution in phase space into the final distribution using a sequence of invertible, volume-preserving transformations derived from Hamiltonian dynamics. The model is trained on a dataset comprising initial and final states at a fixed time T, generated via numerical simulations. After training, the model enables fast sampling of the final distribution from any given initial state. Moreover, by automatically learning an interpretable physical potential, it can generalize to intermediate states not seen during training, offering insights into the system's evolution across time.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) makes it possible to train models on data that would otherwise remain untapped and inaccessible. Simultaneously, pre-trained language models (LMs) have emerged as indispensable tools in modern workflows. These models exhibit extraordinary capabilities and are easily adapted to downstream tasks. This opens one of the most exciting frontiers in FL: fine-tuning LMs. However, a persistent challenge in FL is the frequent, rigid communication of parameters, a problem which is magnified by the sheer size of these modern models. Currently, the FedOpt family of algorithms is the prevailing approach in FL, though it relies on fixed, heuristic intervals for model synchronization. Recently, the FDA algorithm introduced a dynamic alternative by monitoring training progress, but it came with its own drawbacks; namely, a hard-to-tune threshold parameter and a rigid synchronization scheme. In this work, we introduce the FDA-Opt family of algorithms -- a unified generalization that extends the principles behind both FDA and FedOpt, while resolving their core limitations. We evaluate our approach on fine-tuning LMs across a range of downstream NLP tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms FedOpt -- even when FDA-Opt operates under hyper-parameter settings originally optimized for its competitors. In other words, we show that FDA-Opt is a practical, drop-in replacement for FedOpt in modern FL libraries and systems: it requires no additional configuration and delivers superior performance out of the box.

Abstract: Achieving generalization in neural approaches across different scales and distributions remains a significant challenge for the Traveling Salesman Problem~(TSP). A key obstacle is that neural networks often fail to learn robust principles for identifying universal patterns and deriving optimal solutions from diverse instances. In this paper, we first uncover Purity Law (PuLa), a fundamental structural principle for optimal TSP solutions, defining that edge prevalence grows exponentially with the sparsity of surrounding vertices. Statistically validated across diverse instances, PuLa reveals a consistent bias toward local sparsity in global optima. Building on this insight, we propose Purity Policy Optimization~(PUPO), a novel training paradigm that explicitly aligns characteristics of neural solutions with PuLa during the solution construction process to enhance generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PUPO can be seamlessly integrated with popular neural solvers, significantly enhancing their generalization performance without incurring additional computational overhead during inference.

<title>ABKD: Pursuing a Proper Allocation of the Probability Mass in Knowledge Distillation via $\alpha$-$\beta$-Divergence</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model by minimizing the divergence between their output distributions, typically using forward Kullback-Leibler divergence (FKLD) or reverse KLD (RKLD). It has become an effective training paradigm due to the broader supervision information provided by the teacher distribution compared to one-hot labels. We identify that the core challenge in KD lies in balancing two mode-concentration effects: the \textbf{\textit{Hardness-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on modes with large errors, and the \textbf{\textit{Confidence-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on modes with high student confidence. Through an analysis of how probabilities are reassigned during gradient updates, we observe that these two effects are entangled in FKLD and RKLD, but in extreme forms. Specifically, both are too weak in FKLD, causing the student to fail to concentrate on the target class. In contrast, both are too strong in RKLD, causing the student to overly emphasize the target class while ignoring the broader distributional information from the teacher. To address this imbalance, we propose ABKD, a generic framework with $\alpha$-$\beta$-divergence. Our theoretical results show that ABKD offers a smooth interpolation between FKLD and RKLD, achieving an effective trade-off between these effects. Extensive experiments on 17 language/vision datasets with 12 teacher-student settings confirm its efficacy. The code is available at https://github.com/ghwang-s/abkd.

Abstract: This paper presents a multitask learning approach based on long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks for the joint prediction of arboviral outbreaks and case counts of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Recife, Brazil. Leveraging historical public health data from DataSUS (2017-2023), the proposed model concurrently performs binary classification (outbreak detection) and regression (case forecasting) tasks. A sliding window strategy was adopted to construct temporal features using varying input lengths (60, 90, and 120 days), with hyperparameter optimization carried out using Keras Tuner. Model evaluation used time series cross-validation for robustness and a held-out test from 2023 for generalization assessment. The results show that longer windows improve dengue regression accuracy, while classification performance peaked at intermediate windows, suggesting an optimal trade-off between sequence length and generalization. The multitask architecture delivers competitive performance across diseases and tasks, demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of unified modeling strategies for scalable epidemic forecasting in data-limited public health scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning transforms large language models while creating a vulnerability we experimentally verify: Our experiment shows that malicious RL fine-tuning dismantles safety guardrails with remarkable efficiency, requiring only 50 steps and minimal adversarial prompts, with harmful escalating from 0-2 to 7-9. This attack vector particularly threatens open-source models with parameter-level access. Existing defenses targeting supervised fine-tuning prove ineffective against RL's dynamic feedback mechanisms. We introduce Reward Neutralization, the first defense framework specifically designed against RL fine-tuning attacks, establishing concise rejection patterns that render malicious reward signals ineffective. Our approach trains models to produce minimal-information rejections that attackers cannot exploit, systematically neutralizing attempts to optimize toward harmful outputs. Experiments validate that our approach maintains low harmful scores (no greater than 2) after 200 attack steps, while standard models rapidly deteriorate. This work provides the first constructive proof that robust defense against increasingly accessible RL attacks is achievable, addressing a critical security gap for open-weight models.

<title>Complexity Lower Bounds of Adaptive Gradient Algorithms for Non-convex Stochastic Optimization under Relaxed Smoothness</title>

Abstract: Recent results in non-convex stochastic optimization demonstrate the convergence of popular adaptive algorithms (e.g., AdaGrad) under the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, but the rate of convergence is a higher-order polynomial in terms of problem parameters like the smoothness constants. The complexity guaranteed by such algorithms to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point may be significantly larger than the optimal complexity of $\Theta \left( \Delta L \sigma^2 \epsilon^{-4} \right)$ achieved by SGD in the $L$-smooth setting, where $\Delta$ is the initial optimality gap, $\sigma^2$ is the variance of stochastic gradient. However, it is currently not known whether these higher-order dependencies can be tightened. To answer this question, we investigate complexity lower bounds for several adaptive optimization algorithms in the $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth setting, with a focus on the dependence in terms of problem parameters $\Delta, L_0, L_1$. We provide complexity bounds for three variations of AdaGrad, which show at least a quadratic dependence on problem parameters $\Delta, L_0, L_1$. Notably, we show that the decorrelated variant of AdaGrad-Norm requires at least $\Omega \left( \Delta^2 L_1^2 \sigma^2 \epsilon^{-4} \right)$ stochastic gradient queries to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. We also provide a lower bound for SGD with a broad class of adaptive stepsizes. Our results show that, for certain adaptive algorithms, the $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth setting is fundamentally more difficult than the standard smooth setting, in terms of the initial optimality gap and the smoothness constants.

Abstract: We prove tight upper and lower bounds of $\Theta\left(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}\left( \sqrt{2^k \log\binom{n}{k} } + \log\binom{n}{k} \right)\right)$ on the number of samples required for distribution-free $k$-junta testing. This is the first tight bound for testing a natural class of Boolean functions in the distribution-free sample-based model. Our bounds also hold for the feature selection problem, showing that a junta tester must learn the set of relevant variables. For tolerant junta testing, we prove a sample lower bound of $\Omega(2^{(1-o(1)) k} + \log\binom{n}{k})$ showing that, unlike standard testing, there is no large gap between tolerant testing and learning.

arXiv:2505.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Responsibly deploying artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) systems in high-stakes settings arguably requires not only proof of system reliability, but moreover continual, post-deployment monitoring to quickly detect and address any unsafe behavior. Statistical methods for nonparametric change-point detection -- especially the tools of conformal test martingales (CTMs) and anytime-valid inference -- offer promising approaches to this monitoring task. However, existing methods are restricted to monitoring limited hypothesis classes or ``alarm criteria,'' such as data shifts that violate certain exchangeability assumptions, or do not allow for online adaptation in response to shifts. In this paper, we expand the scope of these monitoring methods by proposing a weighted generalization of conformal test martingales (WCTMs), which lay a theoretical foundation for online monitoring for any unexpected changepoints in the data distribution while controlling false-alarms. For practical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms that accommodate online adaptation to mild covariate shifts (in the marginal input distribution) while raising alarms in response to more severe shifts, such as concept shifts (in the conditional label distribution) or extreme (out-of-support) covariate shifts that cannot be easily adapted to. On real-world datasets, we demonstrate improved performance relative to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Vision is well-known for its use in manipulation, especially using visual servoing. To make it robust, multiple cameras are needed to expand the field of view. That is computationally challenging. Merging multiple views and using Q-learning allows the design of more effective representations and optimization of sample efficiency. Such a solution might be expensive to deploy. To mitigate this, we introduce a Merge And Disentanglement (MAD) algorithm that efficiently merges views to increase sample efficiency while augmenting with single-view features to allow lightweight deployment and ensure robust policies. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach using Meta-World and ManiSkill3. For project website and code, see https://aalmuzairee.github.io/mad

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success in the natural language processing (NLP) field, driving a growing demand to extend their deployment from the cloud to edge devices. However, deploying LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices poses significant challenges, including (1) intensive computations and huge model sizes, (2) great memory and bandwidth demands introduced by the autoregressive generation process, and (3) limited scalability for handling long sequences. To address these challenges, we propose AccLLM, a comprehensive acceleration framework that enables efficient and fast long-context LLM inference through algorithm and hardware co-design. At the algorithmic level, we integrate (1) pruning, (2) {\Lambda}-shaped attention, and (3) an innovative W2A8KV4 (2-bit weights, 8-bit activations, and 4-bit KV cache) quantization scheme, thus effectively reducing memory and bandwidth requirements while facilitating LLMs' long-sequence generation. At the hardware level, we design a dedicated FPGA-based accelerator with a reconfigurable computing engine to effectively and flexibly accommodate diverse operations arising from our compression algorithm, thereby fully translating the algorithmic innovations into tangible hardware efficiency. We validate AccLLM on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA, demonstrating a 4.07x energy efficiency and a 2.98x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art work FlightLLM.

<title>Improving the Serving Performance of Multi-LoRA Large Language Models via Efficient LoRA and KV Cache Management</title>

Abstract: Multiple Low-Rank Adapters (Multi-LoRAs) are gaining popularity for task-specific Large Language Model (LLM) applications. For multi-LoRA serving, caching hot KV caches and LoRA adapters in high bandwidth memory of accelerations can improve inference performance. However, existing Multi-LoRA inference systems fail to optimize serving performance like Time-To-First-Toke (TTFT), neglecting usage dependencies when caching LoRAs and KVs. We therefore propose FASTLIBRA, a Multi-LoRA caching system to optimize the serving performance. FASTLIBRA comprises a dependency-aware cache manager and a performance-driven cache swapper. The cache manager maintains the usage dependencies between LoRAs and KV caches during the inference with a unified caching pool. The cache swapper determines the swap-in or out of LoRAs and KV caches based on a unified cost model, when the HBM is idle or busy, respectively. Experimental results show that ELORA reduces the TTFT by 63.4% on average, compared to state-of-the-art works.

Abstract: Coordinate transformation models often fail to account for nonlinear and spatially dependent distortions, leading to significant residual errors in geospatial applications. Here we propose a residual-based neural correction strategy, in which a neural network learns to model only the systematic distortions left by an initial geometric transformation. By focusing solely on residual patterns, the proposed method reduces model complexity and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with sparse or structured control point configurations. We evaluate the method using both simulated datasets with varying distortion intensities and sampling strategies, as well as under the real-world image georeferencing tasks. Compared with direct neural network coordinate converter and classical transformation models, the residual-based neural correction delivers more accurate and stable results under challenging conditions, while maintaining comparable performance in ideal cases. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of residual modelling as a lightweight and robust alternative for improving coordinate transformation accuracy.

Abstract: Efficient inference of LLMs remains a crucial challenge, with two main phases: a compute-intensive prompt computation and a memory-intensive token generation. Despite existing batching and scheduling techniques, token generation phases fail to fully utilize compute resources, especially when compared to prompt computation phases. To address these challenges, we propose Splitwiser, a methodology that splits the two phases of an LLM inference request onto the same GPU, thereby reducing overhead and improving memory access and cache utilization. By eliminating the need to transfer data across devices, Splitwiser aims to minimize network-related overheads. In this report, we describe the basic structure of our proposed pipeline while sharing preliminary results and analysis. We implement our proposed multiprocessing design on two widely-used and independent LLM architectures: Huggingface and vLLM. We open-source our code for the respective implementations: 1) Huggingface (https://github.com/asad-aali/splitwiser), and 2) vLLM (https://github.com/adney11/vllm-sysml).

Abstract: As foundation models continue to scale, the size of trained models grows exponentially, presenting significant challenges for their evaluation. Current evaluation practices involve curating increasingly large datasets to assess the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, there is a lack of systematic analysis and guidance on determining the sufficiency of test data or selecting informative samples for evaluation. This paper introduces a certifiable and cost-efficient evaluation framework for LLMs. Our framework adapts to different evaluation objectives and outputs confidence intervals that contain true values with high probability. We use ``test sample complexity'' to quantify the number of test points needed for a certifiable evaluation and derive tight bounds on test sample complexity. Based on the developed theory, we develop a partition-based algorithm, named Cer-Eval, that adaptively selects test points to minimize the cost of LLM evaluation. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Cer-Eval can save 20% to 40% test points across various benchmarks, while maintaining an estimation error level comparable to the current evaluation process and providing a 95% confidence guarantee.

Abstract: This paper presents a holistic approach to attacker preference modeling from system-level audit logs using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Adversary modeling is an important capability in cybersecurity that lets defenders characterize behaviors of potential attackers, which enables attribution to known cyber adversary groups. Existing approaches rely on documenting an ever-evolving set of attacker tools and techniques to track known threat actors. Although attacks evolve constantly, attacker behavioral preferences are intrinsic and less volatile. Our approach learns the behavioral preferences of cyber adversaries from forensics data on their tools and techniques. We model the attacker as an expert decision-making agent with unknown behavioral preferences situated in a computer host. We leverage attack provenance graphs of audit logs to derive a state-action trajectory of the attack. We test our approach on open datasets of audit logs containing real attack data. Our results demonstrate for the first time that low-level forensics data can automatically reveal an adversary's subjective preferences, which serves as an additional dimension to modeling and documenting cyber adversaries. Attackers' preferences tend to be invariant despite their different tools and indicate predispositions that are inherent to the attacker. As such, these inferred preferences can potentially serve as unique behavioral signatures of attackers and improve threat attribution.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms generate vast volumes of user feedback, such as star ratings, written reviews, and comments. However, most recommendation engines rely primarily on numerical scores, often overlooking the nuanced opinions embedded in free text. This paper comprehensively reviews sentiment-aware recommendation systems from a natural language processing perspective, covering advancements from 2023 to early 2025. It highlights the benefits of integrating sentiment analysis into e-commerce recommenders to enhance prediction accuracy and explainability through detailed opinion extraction. Our survey categorizes recent work into four main approaches: deep learning classifiers that combine sentiment embeddings with user item interactions, transformer based methods for nuanced feature extraction, graph neural networks that propagate sentiment signals, and conversational recommenders that adapt in real time to user feedback. We summarize model architectures and demonstrate how sentiment flows through recommendation pipelines, impacting dialogue-based suggestions. Key challenges include handling noisy or sarcastic text, dynamic user preferences, and bias mitigation. Finally, we outline research gaps and provide a roadmap for developing smarter, fairer, and more user-centric recommendation tools.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized email filtering, which is critical to protect users from cyber threats such as spam, malware, and phishing. However, the increasing sophistication of adversarial attacks poses a significant challenge to the effectiveness of these filters. This study investigates the impact of adversarial attacks on deep learning-based spam detection systems using real-world datasets. Six prominent deep learning models are evaluated on these datasets, analyzing attacks at the word, character sentence, and AI-generated paragraph-levels. Novel scoring functions, including spam weights and attention weights, are introduced to improve attack effectiveness. This comprehensive analysis sheds light on the vulnerabilities of spam filters and contributes to efforts to improve their security against evolving adversarial threats.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have shown potential in analyzing digitized hand-drawn signals for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. However, the lack of clear interpretability in existing diagnostic methods presents a challenge to clinical trust. In this paper, we propose PointExplainer, an explainable diagnostic strategy to identify hand-drawn regions that drive model diagnosis. Specifically, PointExplainer assigns discrete attribution values to hand-drawn segments, explicitly quantifying their relative contributions to the model's decision. Its key components include: (i) a diagnosis module, which encodes hand-drawn signals into 3D point clouds to represent hand-drawn trajectories, and (ii) an explanation module, which trains an interpretable surrogate model to approximate the local behavior of the black-box diagnostic model. We also introduce consistency measures to further address the issue of faithfulness in explanations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and a newly constructed dataset show that PointExplainer can provide intuitive explanations with no diagnostic performance degradation. The source code is available at https://github.com/chaoxuewang/PointExplainer.

Abstract: Clustering bandits have gained significant attention in recommender systems by leveraging collaborative information from neighboring users to better capture target user preferences. However, these methods often lack a clear definition of similar users and face challenges when users with unique preferences lack appropriate neighbors. In such cases, relying on divergent preferences of misidentified neighbors can degrade recommendation quality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive Collaborative Combinatorial Bandits algorithm (CoCoB). CoCoB employs an innovative two-sided bandit architecture, applying bandit principles to both the user and item sides. The user-bandit employs an enhanced Bayesian model to explore user similarity, identifying neighbors based on a similarity probability threshold. The item-bandit treats items as arms, generating diverse recommendations informed by the user-bandit's output. CoCoB dynamically adapts, leveraging neighbor preferences when available or focusing solely on the target user otherwise. Regret analysis under a linear contextual bandit setting and experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate CoCoB's effectiveness, achieving an average 2.4% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, manifesting with motor and non-motor symptoms. Depressive symptoms are prevalent in PD, affecting up to 45% of patients. They are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping motor features, such as hypomimia. This study explores deep learning (DL) models-ViViT, Video Swin Tiny, and 3D CNN-LSTM with attention layers-to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms, as detected by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), in PD patients through facial video analysis. The same parameters were assessed in a secondary analysis taking into account whether patients were one hour after (ON-medication state) or 12 hours without (OFF-medication state) dopaminergic medication. Using a dataset of 1,875 videos from 178 patients, the Video Swin Tiny model achieved the highest performance, with up to 94% accuracy and 93.7% F1-score in binary classification (presence of absence of depressive symptoms), and 87.1% accuracy with an 85.4% F1-score in multiclass tasks (absence or mild or severe depressive symptoms).

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing generates vast amounts of image data, crucial for defect identification and yield optimization, yet often exceeds manual inspection capabilities. Traditional clustering techniques struggle with high-dimensional, unlabeled data, limiting their effectiveness in capturing nuanced patterns. This paper introduces an advanced clustering framework that integrates deep Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with self-supervised and transfer learning techniques, offering a novel approach to unsupervised image clustering. TDA captures intrinsic topological features, while self-supervised learning extracts meaningful representations from unlabeled data, reducing reliance on labeled datasets. Transfer learning enhances the framework's adaptability and scalability, allowing fine-tuning to new datasets without retraining from scratch. Validated on synthetic and open-source semiconductor image datasets, the framework successfully identifies clusters aligned with defect patterns and process variations. This study highlights the transformative potential of combining TDA, self-supervised learning, and transfer learning, providing a scalable solution for proactive process monitoring and quality control in semiconductor manufacturing and other domains with large-scale image datasets.

<title>Differentially Private Densest-$k$-Subgraph</title>

Abstract: Many graph datasets involve sensitive network data, motivating the need for privacy-preserving graph mining. The Densest-$k$-subgraph (D$k$S) problem is a key primitive in graph mining that aims to extract a subset of $k$ vertices with the maximum internal connectivity. Although non-private algorithms are known for D$k$S, this paper is the first to design algorithms that offer formal differential privacy (DP) guarantees for the problem. We base our general approach on using the principal component (PC) of the graph adjacency matrix to output a subset of $k$ vertices under edge DP. For this task, we first consider output perturbation, which traditionally offer good scalability, but at the expense of utility. Our tight on the local sensitivity indicate a big gap with the global sensitivity, motivating the use of instance specific sensitive methods for private PC. Next, we derive a tight bound on the smooth sensitivity and show that it can be close to the global sensitivity. This leads us to consider the Propose-Test-Release (PTR) framework for private PC. Although computationally expensive in general, we design a novel approach for implementing PTR in the same time as computation of a non-private PC, while offering good utility for \DkS{}. Additionally, we also consider the iterative private power method (PPM) for private PC, albeit it is significantly slower than PTR on large networks. We run our methods on diverse real-world networks, with the largest having 3 million vertices, and show good privacy-utility trade-offs. Although PTR requires a slightly larger privacy budget, on average, it achieves a 180-fold improvement in runtime over PPM.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving towards multi-agent systems where numerous AI agents collaborate and interact with external tools. Two key open standards, Google's Agent to Agent (A2A) protocol for inter-agent communication and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool access, promise to overcome the limitations of fragmented, custom integration approaches. While their potential synergy is significant, this paper argues that effectively integrating A2A and MCP presents unique, emergent challenges at their intersection, particularly concerning semantic interoperability between agent tasks and tool capabilities, the compounded security risks arising from combined discovery and execution, and the practical governance required for the envisioned "Agent Economy". This work provides a critical analysis, moving beyond a survey to evaluate the practical implications and inherent difficulties of combining these horizontal and vertical integration standards. We examine the benefits (e.g., specialization, scalability) while critically assessing their dependencies and trade-offs in an integrated context. We identify key challenges increased by the integration, including novel security vulnerabilities, privacy complexities, debugging difficulties across protocols, and the need for robust semantic negotiation mechanisms. In summary, A2A+MCP offers a vital architectural foundation, but fully realizing its potential requires substantial advancements to manage the complexities of their combined operation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development through code generation capabilities, yet their effectiveness for high-performance computing (HPC) remains limited. HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9% performance improvement over the base MARCO system. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Humans excel in navigating diverse, complex environments with agile motor skills, exemplified by parkour practitioners performing dynamic maneuvers, such as climbing up walls and jumping across gaps. Reproducing these agile movements with simulated characters remains challenging, in part due to the scarcity of motion capture data for agile terrain traversal behaviors and the high cost of acquiring such data. In this work, we introduce PARC (Physics-based Augmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Character Controllers), a framework that leverages machine learning and physics-based simulation to iteratively augment motion datasets and expand the capabilities of terrain traversal controllers. PARC begins by training a motion generator on a small dataset consisting of core terrain traversal skills. The motion generator is then used to produce synthetic data for traversing new terrains. However, these generated motions often exhibit artifacts, such as incorrect contacts or discontinuities. To correct these artifacts, we train a physics-based tracking controller to imitate the motions in simulation. The corrected motions are then added to the dataset, which is used to continue training the motion generator in the next iteration. PARC's iterative process jointly expands the capabilities of the motion generator and tracker, creating agile and versatile models for interacting with complex environments. PARC provides an effective approach to develop controllers for agile terrain traversal, which bridges the gap between the scarcity of motion data and the need for versatile character controllers.

Abstract: This paper provides a formulation of the particle flow particle filter from the perspective of variational inference. We show that the transient density used to derive the particle flow particle filter follows a time-scaled trajectory of the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in the space of probability densities. The Fisher-Rao gradient flow is obtained as a continuous-time algorithm for variational inference, minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational density and the true posterior density.

Abstract: Structured outputs are essential for large language models (LLMs) in critical applications like agents and information extraction. Despite their capabilities, LLMs often generate outputs that deviate from predefined schemas, significantly hampering reliable application development. We present SLOT (Structured LLM Output Transformer), a model-agnostic approach that transforms unstructured LLM outputs into precise structured formats. While existing solutions predominantly rely on constrained decoding techniques or are tightly coupled with specific models, SLOT employs a fine-tuned lightweight language model as a post-processing layer, achieving flexibility across various LLMs and schema specifications. We introduce a systematic pipeline for data curation and synthesis alongside a formal evaluation methodology that quantifies both schema accuracy and content fidelity. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned Mistral-7B model with constrained decoding achieves near perfect schema accuracy (99.5%) and content similarity (94.0%), outperforming Claude-3.5-Sonnet by substantial margins (+25 and +20 percentage points, respectively). Notably, even compact models like Llama-3.2-1B can match or exceed the structured output capabilities of much larger proprietary models when equipped with SLOT, enabling reliable structured generation in resource-constrained environments.

<title>Prism: Unleashing GPU Sharing for Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving</title>

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is expensive, especially for providers hosting many models, making cost reduction essential. The unique workload patterns of serving multiple LLMs (i.e., multi-LLM serving) create new opportunities and challenges for this task. The long-tail popularity of models and their long idle periods present opportunities to improve utilization through GPU sharing. However, existing GPU sharing systems lack the ability to adjust their resource allocation and sharing policies at runtime, making them ineffective at meeting latency service-level objectives (SLOs) under rapidly fluctuating workloads.
  This paper presents Prism, a multi-LLM serving system that unleashes the full potential of GPU sharing to achieve both cost efficiency and SLO attainment. At its core, Prism tackles a key limitation of existing systems$\unicode{x2014}$the lack of $\textit{cross-model memory coordination}$, which is essential for flexibly sharing GPU memory across models under dynamic workloads. Prism achieves this with two key designs. First, it supports on-demand memory allocation by dynamically mapping physical to virtual memory pages, allowing flexible memory redistribution among models that space- and time-share a GPU. Second, it improves memory efficiency through a two-level scheduling policy that dynamically adjusts sharing strategies based on models' runtime demands. Evaluations on real-world traces show that Prism achieves more than $2\times$ cost savings and $3.3\times$ SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit diverse temporal spike patterns, which are believed to support efficient, robust, and adaptive neural information processing. While models such as Izhikevich can replicate a wide range of these firing dynamics, their complexity poses challenges for directly integrating them into scalable spiking neural networks (SNN) training pipelines. In this work, we propose two probabilistically driven, input-level temporal spike transformations: Poisson-Burst and Delayed-Burst that introduce biologically inspired temporal variability directly into standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This enables scalable training and systematic evaluation of how spike timing dynamics affect privacy, generalization, and learning performance. Poisson-Burst modulates burst occurrence based on input intensity, while Delayed-Burst encodes input strength through burst onset timing. Through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Poisson-Burst maintains competitive accuracy and lower resource overhead while exhibiting enhanced privacy robustness against membership inference attacks, whereas Delayed-Burst provides stronger privacy protection at a modest accuracy trade-off. These findings highlight the potential of biologically grounded temporal spike dynamics in improving the privacy, generalization and biological plausibility of neuromorphic learning systems.

Abstract: We propose an input convex neural network (ICNN)-based self-supervised learning framework to solve continuous constrained optimization problems. By integrating the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) with the constraint correction mechanism, our framework ensures \emph{non-strict constraint feasibility}, \emph{better optimality gap}, and \emph{best convergence rate} with respect to the state-of-the-art learning-based methods. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis, showing that the algorithm converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original problem even when the internal solver is a neural network, and the approximation error is bounded. We test our approach on a range of benchmark tasks including quadratic programming (QP), nonconvex programming, and large-scale AC optimal power flow problems. The results demonstrate that compared to existing solvers (e.g., \texttt{OSQP}, \texttt{IPOPT}) and the latest learning-based methods (e.g., DC3, PDL), our approach achieves a superior balance among accuracy, feasibility, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to classify T1-weighted brain MRI scans as healthy or Alzheimer. The network comprises 3D convolution, pooling, batch normalization, dense ReLU layers, and a sigmoid output. Using stochastic noise injection and five-fold cross-validation, the model achieved test set accuracy of 0.912 and area under the ROC curve of 0.961, an improvement of approximately 0.027 over resizing alone. Sensitivity and specificity both exceeded 0.90. These results align with prior work reporting up to 0.10 gain via synthetic augmentation. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of simple augmentation for 3D MRI classification and motivate future exploration of advanced augmentation methods and architectures such as 3D U-Net and vision transformers.

Abstract: Evaluating the regeneration process of damaged muscle tissue is a fundamental analysis in muscle research to measure experimental effect sizes and uncover mechanisms behind muscle weakness due to aging and disease. The conventional approach to assessing muscle tissue regeneration involves whole-slide imaging and expert visual inspection of the recovery stages based on the morphological information of cells and fibers. There is a need to replace these tasks with automated methods incorporating machine learning techniques to ensure a quantitative and objective analysis. Given the limited availability of fully labeled data, a possible approach is Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a weakly supervised learning method using class label proportions. However, current LLP methods have two limitations: (1) they cannot adapt the feature extractor for muscle tissues, and (2) they treat the classes representing recovery stages and cell morphological changes as nominal, resulting in the loss of ordinal information. To address these issues, we propose Ordinal Scale Learning from Similarity Proportion (OSLSP), which uses a similarity proportion loss derived from two bag combinations. OSLSP can update the feature extractor by using class proportion attention to the ordinal scale of the class. Our model with OSLSP outperforms large-scale pre-trained and fine-tuning models in classification tasks of skeletal muscle recovery stages.

Abstract: E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models~(LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps mitigate this, but at a high computational cost while risking misinformation. Adaptive retrieval aims to retrieve only when necessary, but existing approaches rely on LLM-based uncertainty estimation, which remain inefficient and impractical. In this study, we introduce lightweight LLM-independent adaptive retrieval methods based on external information. We investigated 27 features, organized into 7 groups, and their hybrid combinations. We evaluated these methods on 6 QA datasets, assessing the QA performance and efficiency. The results show that our approach matches the performance of complex LLM-based methods while achieving significant efficiency gains, demonstrating the potential of external information for adaptive retrieval.

Abstract: Biologically-informed neural networks typically leverage pathway annotations to enhance performance in biomedical applications. We hypothesized that the benefits of pathway integration does not arise from its biological relevance, but rather from the sparsity it introduces. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of all relevant pathway-based neural network models for predictive tasks, critically evaluating each study's contributions. From this review, we curated a subset of methods for which the source code was publicly available. The comparison of the biologically informed state-of-the-art deep learning models and their randomized counterparts showed that models based on randomized information performed equally well as biologically informed ones across different metrics and datasets. Notably, in 3 out of the 15 analyzed models, the randomized versions even outperformed their biologically informed counterparts. Moreover, pathway-informed models did not show any clear advantage in interpretability, as randomized models were still able to identify relevant disease biomarkers despite lacking explicit pathway information. Our findings suggest that pathway annotations may be too noisy or inadequately explored by current methods. Therefore, we propose a methodology that can be applied to different domains and can serve as a robust benchmark for systematically comparing novel pathway-informed models against their randomized counterparts. This approach enables researchers to rigorously determine whether observed performance improvements can be attributed to biological insights.

<title>Balancing Accuracy, Calibration, and Efficiency in Active Learning with Vision Transformers Under Label Noise</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional neural networks on ImageNet for downstream tasks is well-established. Still, the impact of model size on the performance of vision transformers in similar scenarios, particularly under label noise, remains largely unexplored. Given the utility and versatility of transformer architectures, this study investigates their practicality under low-budget constraints and noisy labels. We explore how classification accuracy and calibration are affected by symmetric label noise in active learning settings, evaluating four vision transformer configurations (Base and Large with 16x16 and 32x32 patch sizes) and three Swin Transformer configurations (Tiny, Small, and Base) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, under varying label noise rates. Our findings show that larger ViT models (ViTl32 in particular) consistently outperform their smaller counterparts in both accuracy and calibration, even under moderate to high label noise, while Swin Transformers exhibit weaker robustness across all noise levels. We find that smaller patch sizes do not always lead to better performance, as ViTl16 performs consistently worse than ViTl32 while incurring a higher computational cost. We also find that information-based Active Learning strategies only provide meaningful accuracy improvements at moderate label noise rates, but they result in poorer calibration compared to models trained on randomly acquired labels, especially at high label noise rates. We hope these insights provide actionable guidance for practitioners looking to deploy vision transformers in resource-constrained environments, where balancing model complexity, label noise, and compute efficiency is critical in model fine-tuning or distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we address the voice conversion (VC) task using a vector-based interface. To align audio embeddings between speakers, we employ discrete optimal transport mapping. Our evaluation results demonstrate the high quality and effectiveness of this method. Additionally, we show that applying discrete optimal transport as a post-processing step in audio generation can lead to the incorrect classification of synthetic audio as real.

Abstract: We propose a deep product-unit residual neural network (PURe) that integrates product units into residual blocks to improve the expressiveness and parameter efficiency of deep convolutional networks. Unlike standard summation neurons, product units enable multiplicative feature interactions, potentially offering a more powerful representation of complex patterns. PURe replaces conventional convolutional layers with 2D product units in the second layer of each residual block, eliminating nonlinear activation functions to preserve structural information. We validate PURe on three benchmark datasets. On Galaxy10 DECaLS, PURe34 achieves the highest test accuracy of 84.89%, surpassing the much deeper ResNet152, while converging nearly five times faster and demonstrating strong robustness to Poisson noise. On ImageNet, PURe architectures outperform standard ResNet models at similar depths, with PURe34 achieving a top-1 accuracy of 80.27% and top-5 accuracy of 95.78%, surpassing deeper ResNet variants (ResNet50, ResNet101) while utilizing significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. On CIFAR-10, PURe consistently outperforms ResNet variants across varying depths, with PURe272 reaching 95.01% test accuracy, comparable to ResNet1001 but at less than half the model size. These results demonstrate that PURe achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Compared to traditional residual networks, PURe not only achieves competitive classification performance with faster convergence and fewer parameters, but also demonstrates greater robustness to noise. Its effectiveness across diverse datasets highlights the potential of product-unit-based architectures for scalable and reliable deep learning in computer vision.

Abstract: Optimizing discrete phase shifts in large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is challenging due to their non-convex and non-linear nature. In this letter, we propose a heuristic-integrated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that (1) leverages accumulated actions over multiple steps in the double deep Q-network (DDQN) for RIS column-wise control and (2) integrates a greedy algorithm (GA) into each DRL step to refine the state via fine-grained, element-wise optimization of RIS configurations. By learning from GA-included states, the proposed approach effectively addresses RIS optimization within a small DRL action space, demonstrating its capability to optimize phase-shift configurations of large-scale RISs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained over extensive corpora risk memorizing sensitive, copyrighted, or toxic content. To address this, we propose OBLIVIATE, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA), it ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including the Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: forget quality (new document-level memorization score), model utility, and fluency. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Ornamentations, embellishments, or microtonal inflections are essential to melodic expression across many musical traditions, adding depth, nuance, and emotional impact to performances. Recognizing ornamentations in singing voices is key to MIR, with potential applications in music pedagogy, singer identification, genre classification, and controlled singing voice generation. However, the lack of annotated datasets and specialized modeling approaches remains a major obstacle for progress in this research area. In this work, we introduce R\=aga Ornamentation Detection (ROD), a novel dataset comprising Indian classical music recordings curated by expert musicians. The dataset is annotated using a custom Human-in-the-Loop tool for six vocal ornaments marked as event-based labels. Using this dataset, we develop an ornamentation detection model based on deep time-series analysis, preserving ornament boundaries during the chunking of long audio recordings. We conduct experiments using different train-test configurations within the ROD dataset and also evaluate our approach on a separate, manually annotated dataset of Indian classical concert recordings. Our experimental results support the superior performance of our proposed approach over the baseline CRNN.

Abstract: Automatic music transcription (AMT) is the problem of analyzing an audio recording of a musical piece and detecting notes that are being played. AMT is a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to polyphonic music. The goal of AMT is to produce a score representation of a music piece, by analyzing a sound signal containing multiple notes played simultaneously. In this work, we design a processing pipeline that can transform classical piano audio files in .wav format into a music score representation. The features from the audio signals are extracted using the constant-Q transform, and the resulting coefficients are used as an input to the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

Abstract: To cluster data is to separate samples into distinctive groups that should ideally have some cohesive properties. Today, numerous clustering algorithms exist, and their differences lie essentially in what can be perceived as ``cohesive properties''. Therefore, hypotheses on the nature of clusters must be set: they can be either generative or discriminative. As the last decade witnessed the impressive growth of deep clustering methods that involve neural networks to handle high-dimensional data often in a discriminative manner; we concentrate mainly on the discriminative hypotheses. In this paper, our aim is to provide an accessible historical perspective on the evolution of discriminative clustering methods and notably how the nature of assumptions of the discriminative models changed over time: from decision boundaries to invariance critics. We notably highlight how mutual information has been a historical cornerstone of the progress of (deep) discriminative clustering methods. We also show some known limitations of mutual information and how discriminative clustering methods tried to circumvent those. We then discuss the challenges that discriminative clustering faces with respect to the selection of the number of clusters. Finally, we showcase these techniques using the dedicated Python package, GemClus, that we have developed for discriminative clustering.

Abstract: Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. Building upon the ideas of continuous normalizing flows, flow matching models generalize the transport path of the diffusion models from a simple prior distribution to the data. Most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying structure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating manifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often require expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we present \texttt{Latent-CFM}, which provides simplified training/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal synthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that \texttt{Latent-CFM} exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training ($\sim 50\%$ less in some cases) and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning by combining recent advances in regularized linear programming formulations with the classical theory of stochastic approximation. Motivated by the challenge of designing algorithms that leverage off-policy data while maintaining on-policy exploration, we propose PGDA-RL, a novel primal-dual Projected Gradient Descent-Ascent algorithm for solving regularized Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). PGDA-RL integrates experience replay-based gradient estimation with a two-timescale decomposition of the underlying nested optimization problem. The algorithm operates asynchronously, interacts with the environment through a single trajectory of correlated data, and updates its policy online in response to the dual variable associated with the occupation measure of the underlying MDP. We prove that PGDA-RL converges almost surely to the optimal value function and policy of the regularized MDP. Our convergence analysis relies on tools from stochastic approximation theory and holds under weaker assumptions than those required by existing primal-dual RL approaches, notably removing the need for a simulator or a fixed behavioral policy.

Abstract: Cost-effective machine vision systems dedicated to real-time and accurate face detection and recognition in public places are crucial for many modern applications. However, despite their high performance, which could be reached using specialized edge or cloud AI hardware accelerators, there is still room for improvement in throughput and power consumption. This paper aims to suggest a combined hardware-software approach that optimizes face detection and recognition systems on one of the latest edge GPUs, namely NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. First, it leverages the simultaneous usage of all its hardware engines to improve processing time. This offers an improvement over previous works where these tasks were mainly allocated automatically and exclusively to the CPU or, to a higher extent, to the GPU core. Additionally, the paper suggests integrating a face tracker module to avoid redundantly running the face recognition algorithm for every frame but only when a new face appears in the scene. The results of extended experiments suggest that simultaneous usage of all the hardware engines that are available in the Orin GPU and tracker integration into the pipeline yield an impressive throughput of 290 FPS (frames per second) on 1920 x 1080 input size frames containing in average of 6 faces/frame. Additionally, a substantial saving of power consumption of around 800 mW was achieved when compared to running the task on the CPU/GPU engines only and without integrating a tracker into the Orin GPU\'92s pipeline. This hardware-codesign approach can pave the way to design high-performance machine vision systems at the edge, critically needed in video monitoring in public places where several nearby cameras are usually deployed for a same scene.

Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) aims to learn from non-stationary data streams across domains while retaining and utilizing past knowledge. Although prompt-based methods effectively store multi-domain knowledge in prompt parameters and obtain advanced performance through cross-domain prompt fusion, we reveal an intrinsic limitation: component-wise misalignment between domain-specific prompts leads to conflicting knowledge integration and degraded predictions. This arises from the random positioning of knowledge components within prompts, where irrelevant component fusion introduces interference.To address this, we propose Componential Prompt-Knowledge Alignment (KA-Prompt), a novel prompt-based DIL method that introduces component-aware prompt-knowledge alignment during training, significantly improving both the learning and inference capacity of the model. KA-Prompt operates in two phases: (1) Initial Componential Structure Configuring, where a set of old prompts containing knowledge relevant to the new domain are mined via greedy search, which is then exploited to initialize new prompts to achieve reusable knowledge transfer and establish intrinsic alignment between new and old prompts. (2) Online Alignment Preservation, which dynamically identifies the target old prompts and applies adaptive componential consistency constraints as new prompts evolve. Extensive experiments on DIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our KA-Prompt. Our source code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICML2025-KA-Prompt

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, autonomous agents fall short of humans in their capability to quickly adapt to new and unfamiliar teammates. We posit that a limiting factor for zero-shot coordination is the lack of shared task abstractions, a mechanism humans rely on to implicitly align with teammates. To address this gap, we introduce HA$^2$: Hierarchical Ad Hoc Agents, a framework leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to mimic the structured approach humans use in collaboration. We evaluate HA$^2$ in the Overcooked environment, demonstrating statistically significant improvement over existing baselines when paired with both unseen agents and humans, providing better resilience to environmental shifts, and outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Rehabilitation robots are often used in game-like interactions for rehabilitation to increase a person's motivation to complete rehabilitation exercises. By adjusting exercise difficulty for a specific user throughout the exercise interaction, robots can maximize both the user's rehabilitation outcomes and the their motivation throughout the exercise. Previous approaches have assumed exercises have generic difficulty values that apply to all users equally, however, we identified that stroke survivors have varied and unique perceptions of exercise difficulty. For example, some stroke survivors found reaching vertically more difficult than reaching farther but lower while others found reaching farther more challenging than reaching vertically. In this paper, we formulate a causal tree-based method to calculate exercise difficulty based on the user's performance. We find that this approach accurately models exercise difficulty and provides a readily interpretable model of why that exercise is difficult for both users and caretakers.

Abstract: Despite the superior diagnostic capability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), its use as a Point-of-Care (PoC) device remains limited by high cost and complexity. To enable such a future by reducing the magnetic field strength, one key approach will be to improve sampling strategies. Previous work has shown that it is possible to make diagnostic decisions directly from k-space with fewer samples. Such work shows that single diagnostic decisions can be made, but if we aspire to see MRI as a true PoC, multiple and sequential decisions are necessary while minimizing the number of samples acquired. We present a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework enabling comprehensive, sequential, diagnostic evaluation from undersampled k-space data. Our approach during inference actively adapts to sequential decisions to optimally sample. To achieve this, we introduce a training methodology that identifies the samples that contribute the best to each diagnostic objective using a step-wise weighting reward function. We evaluate our approach in two sequential knee pathology assessment tasks: ACL sprain detection and cartilage thickness loss assessment. Our framework achieves diagnostic performance competitive with various policy-based benchmarks on disease detection, severity quantification, and overall sequential diagnosis, while substantially saving k-space samples. Our approach paves the way for the future of MRI as a comprehensive and affordable PoC device. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/vios-s/MRI_Sequential_Active_Sampling

Abstract: When the likelihood is analytically unavailable and computationally intractable, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has emerged as a widely used methodology for approximate posterior inference; however, it suffers from severe computational inefficiency in high-dimensional settings or under diffuse priors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptive Bayesian Inference (ABI), a framework that bypasses traditional data-space discrepancies and instead compares distributions directly in posterior space through nonparametric distribution matching. By leveraging a novel Marginally-augmented Sliced Wasserstein (MSW) distance on posterior measures and exploiting its quantile representation, ABI transforms the challenging problem of measuring divergence between posterior distributions into a tractable sequence of one-dimensional conditional quantile regression tasks. Moreover, we introduce a new adaptive rejection sampling scheme that iteratively refines the posterior approximation by updating the proposal distribution via generative density estimation. Theoretically, we establish parametric convergence rates for the trimmed MSW distance and prove that the ABI posterior converges to the true posterior as the tolerance threshold vanishes. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ABI significantly outperforms data-based Wasserstein ABC, summary-based ABC, and state-of-the-art likelihood-free simulators, especially in high-dimensional or dependent observation regimes.

Abstract: We establish that testing for the equality of two probability measures on a general separable and compact metric space is equivalent to testing for the singularity between two corresponding Gaussian measures on a suitable Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. The corresponding Gaussians are defined via the notion of kernel mean and covariance embedding of a probability measure. Discerning two singular Gaussians is fundamentally simpler from an information-theoretic perspective than non-parametric two-sample testing, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Our proof leverages the Feldman-Hajek criterion for singularity/equivalence of Gaussians on Hilbert spaces, and shows that discrepancies between distributions are heavily magnified through their corresponding Gaussian embeddings: at a population level, distinct probability measures lead to essentially separated Gaussian embeddings. This appears to be a new instance of the blessing of dimensionality that can be harnessed for the design of efficient inference tools in great generality.

Abstract: We introduce Audio-SDS, a generalization of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to text-conditioned audio diffusion models. While SDS was initially designed for text-to-3D generation using image diffusion, its core idea of distilling a powerful generative prior into a separate parametric representation extends to the audio domain. Leveraging a single pretrained model, Audio-SDS enables a broad range of tasks without requiring specialized datasets. In particular, we demonstrate how Audio-SDS can guide physically informed impact sound simulations, calibrate FM-synthesis parameters, and perform prompt-specified source separation. Our findings illustrate the versatility of distillation-based methods across modalities and establish a robust foundation for future work using generative priors in audio tasks.

Abstract: It is shown that the weight matrices of a Physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based deep learning application to a rarefied gas dynamics problem described by the Boltzmann equation bear no evident link to the mathematical structure of the physical problem. Instead, the weights appear close to Gaussian distributed random matrices. Although significantly more work is needed to support a robust assessment in this direction, these results suggest that deep-learning and the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation represent two equivalent, but largely distinct paths to the same physical knowledge. If so, Explainable AI might be an unrealistic target and possibly even an ill-posed one.

Abstract: Random number generators (RNGs) that are crucial for cryptographic applications have been the subject of adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit environmental information to predict generated random numbers that are supposed to be truly random and unpredictable. Though quantum random number generators (QRNGs) are based on the intrinsic indeterministic nature of quantum properties, the presence of classical noise in the measurement process compromises the integrity of a QRNG. In this paper, we develop a predictive machine learning (ML) analysis to investigate the impact of deterministic classical noise in different stages of an optical continuous variable QRNG. Our ML model successfully detects inherent correlations when the deterministic noise sources are prominent. After appropriate filtering and randomness extraction processes are introduced, our QRNG system, in turn, demonstrates its robustness against ML. We further demonstrate the robustness of our ML approach by applying it to uniformly distributed random numbers from the QRNG and a congruential RNG. Hence, our result shows that ML has potentials in benchmarking the quality of RNG devices.

Abstract: The beekeeping sector has experienced significant production fluctuations in recent years, largely due to increasingly frequent adverse weather events linked to climate change. These events can severely affect the environment, reducing its suitability for bee activity. We conduct a forecasting analysis of honey production across Italy using a range of machine learning models, with a particular focus on weather-related variables as key predictors. Our analysis relies on a dataset collected in 2022, which combines hive-level observations with detailed weather data. We train and compare several linear and nonlinear models, evaluating both their predictive accuracy and interpretability. By examining model explanations, we identify the main drivers of honey production. We also ensemble models from different families to assess whether combining predictions improves forecast accuracy. These insights support beekeepers in managing production risks and may inform the development of insurance products against unexpected losses due to poor harvests.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix completion consists of computing a matrix of minimal complexity that recovers a given set of observations as accurately as possible. Unfortunately, existing methods for matrix completion are heuristics that, while highly scalable and often identifying high-quality solutions, do not possess any optimality guarantees. We reexamine matrix completion with an optimality-oriented eye. We reformulate low-rank matrix completion problems as convex problems over the non-convex set of projection matrices and implement a disjunctive branch-and-bound scheme that solves them to certifiable optimality. Further, we derive a novel and often near-exact class of convex relaxations by decomposing a low-rank matrix as a sum of rank-one matrices and incentivizing that two-by-two minors in each rank-one matrix have determinant zero. In numerical experiments, our new convex relaxations decrease the optimality gap by two orders of magnitude compared to existing attempts, and our disjunctive branch-and-bound scheme solves $n \times m$ rank-$r$ matrix completion problems to certifiable optimality or near optimality in hours for $\max \{m, n\} \leq 2500$ and $r \leq 5$. Moreover, this improvement in the training error translates into an average $2\%$--$50\%$ improvement in the test set error.

Abstract: Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.

Abstract: The Koopman operator presents an attractive approach to achieve global linearization of nonlinear systems, making it a valuable method for simplifying the understanding of complex dynamics. While data-driven methodologies have exhibited promise in approximating finite Koopman operators, they grapple with various challenges, such as the judicious selection of observables, dimensionality reduction, and the ability to predict complex system behaviours accurately. This study presents a novel approach termed Mori-Zwanzig autoencoder (MZ-AE) to robustly approximate the Koopman operator in low-dimensional spaces. The proposed method leverages a nonlinear autoencoder to extract key observables for approximating a finite invariant Koopman subspace and integrates a non-Markovian correction mechanism using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. Consequently, this approach yields an approximate closure of the dynamics within the latent manifold of the nonlinear autoencoder, thereby enhancing the accuracy and stability of the Koopman operator approximation. Demonstrations showcase the technique's improved predictive capability for flow around a cylinder. It also provides a low dimensional approximation for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) with promising short-term predictability and robust long-term statistical performance. By bridging the gap between data-driven techniques and the mathematical foundations of Koopman theory, MZ-AE offers a promising avenue for improved understanding and prediction of complex nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: For a widely-studied data model and general loss and sample-hardening functions we prove that the losses of Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL), Hard-SCL (HSCL), and Unsupervised Contrastive Learning (UCL) are minimized by representations that exhibit Neural-Collapse (NC), i.e., the class means form an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) and data from the same class are mapped to the same representation. We also prove that for any representation mapping, the HSCL and Hard-UCL (HUCL) losses are lower bounded by the corresponding SCL and UCL losses. In contrast to existing literature, our theoretical results for SCL do not require class-conditional independence of augmented views and work for a general loss function class that includes the widely used InfoNCE loss function. Moreover, our proofs are simpler, compact, and transparent. Similar to existing literature, our theoretical claims also hold for the practical scenario where batching is used for optimization. We empirically demonstrate, for the first time, that Adam optimization (with batching) of HSCL and HUCL losses with random initialization and suitable hardness levels can indeed converge to the NC-geometry if we incorporate unit-ball or unit-sphere feature normalization. Without incorporating hard-negatives or feature normalization, however, the representations learned via Adam suffer from Dimensional-Collapse (DC) and fail to attain the NC-geometry. These results exemplify the role of hard-negative sampling in contrastive representation learning and we conclude with several open theoretical problems for future work.

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) models which were recently introduced by the transformer architecture have shown to be very competitive and often become a popular alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, the high computational requirements of these models limit their practical applicability especially on low-power devices. Current state-of-the-art employs approximate multipliers to address the highly increased compute demands of DNN accelerators but no prior research has explored their use on ViT models. In this work we propose TransAxx, a framework based on the popular PyTorch library that enables fast inherent support for approximate arithmetic to seamlessly evaluate the impact of approximate computing on DNNs such as ViT models. Using TransAxx we analyze the sensitivity of transformer models on the ImageNet dataset to approximate multiplications and perform approximate-aware finetuning to regain accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a methodology to generate approximate accelerators for ViT models. Our approach uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to efficiently search the space of possible configurations using a hardware-driven hand-crafted policy. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of our methodology in achieving significant trade-offs between accuracy and power, resulting in substantial gains without compromising on performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework to address these issues. A new spatiotemporal adaptation is proposed to generalize any Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) variant to learn maps between Bochner spaces, which can perform an arbitrary-length temporal super-resolution for the first time. To better exploit this capacity, a new paradigm is proposed to refine the commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations with the help from the wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed paradigm trains an FNO only for a few epochs. Then, only the newly proposed spatiotemporal spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The spectral fine-tuning loss function uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type a posteriori error estimator whose evaluation is exact thanks to the Parseval identity. Moreover, unlike the difficult nonconvex optimization problems in the end-to-end training, this fine-tuning loss is convex. Numerical experiments on commonly used NSE benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers under certain conditions. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/scaomath/torch-cfd.

Abstract: We extend decision tree and random forest algorithms to product space manifolds: Cartesian products of Euclidean, hyperspherical, and hyperbolic manifolds. Such spaces have extremely expressive geometries capable of representing many arrangements of distances with low metric distortion. To date, all classifiers for product spaces fit a single linear decision boundary, and no regressor has been described. Our method enables a simple, expressive method for classification and regression in product manifolds. We demonstrate the superior accuracy of our tool compared to Euclidean methods operating in the ambient space or the tangent plane of the manifold across a range of constant-curvature and product manifolds. Code for our implementation and experiments is available at https://github.com/pchlenski/embedders.

Abstract: Humans can often quickly and efficiently solve complex new learning tasks given only a small set of examples. In contrast, modern artificially intelligent systems often require thousands or millions of observations in order to solve even the most basic tasks. Meta-learning aims to resolve this issue by leveraging past experiences from similar learning tasks to embed the appropriate inductive biases into the learning system. Historically methods for meta-learning components such as optimizers, parameter initializations, and more have led to significant performance increases. This thesis aims to explore the concept of meta-learning to improve performance, through the often-overlooked component of the loss function. The loss function is a vital component of a learning system, as it represents the primary learning objective, where success is determined and quantified by the system's ability to optimize for that objective successfully.

Abstract: In the realm of emerging real-time networked applications like cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Age of Information (AoI) has merged as a pivotal metric for evaluating the timeliness. To meet the high computational demands, such as those in intelligent manufacturing within CPS, mobile edge computing (MEC) presents a promising solution for optimizing computing and reducing AoI. In this work, we study the timeliness of computational-intensive updates and explores jointly optimize the task updating and offloading policies to minimize AoI. Specifically, we consider edge load dynamics and formulate a task scheduling problem to minimize the expected time-average AoI. The fractional objective introduced by AoI and the semi-Markov game nature of the problem render this challenge particularly difficult, with existing approaches not directly applicable. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework to fractional reinforcement learning (RL). We first introduce a fractional single-agent RL framework and prove its linear convergence. We then extend this to a fractional multi-agent RL framework with a convergence analysis. To tackle the challenge of asynchronous control in semi-Markov game, we further design an asynchronous model-free fractional multi-agent RL algorithm, where each device makes scheduling decisions with the hybrid action space without knowing the system dynamics and decisions of other devices. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms reduce the average AoI by up to 52.6% compared with the best baseline algorithm in our experiments.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is pivotal for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Integrating ECG signals with accompanying textual reports further holds immense potential to enhance clinical diagnostics by combining physiological data and qualitative insights. However, this integration faces significant challenges due to inherent modality disparities and the scarcity of labeled data for robust cross-modal learning. To address these obstacles, we propose D-BETA, a novel framework that pre-trains ECG and text data using a contrastive masked auto-encoder architecture. D-BETA uniquely combines the strengths of generative with boosted discriminative capabilities to achieve robust cross-modal representations. This is accomplished through masked modality modeling, specialized loss functions, and an improved negative sampling strategy tailored for cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on five public datasets across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that D-BETA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving an average AUC improvement of 15% in linear probing with only one percent of training data and 2% in zero-shot performance without requiring training data over state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the effectiveness of D-BETA, underscoring its potential to advance automated clinical diagnostics through multi-modal representations. Our sample code and checkpoint are made available at https://github.com/manhph2211/D-BETA.

Abstract: Batched Bayesian optimization (BO) can accelerate molecular design by efficiently identifying top-performing compounds from a large chemical library. Existing acquisition strategies for batch design in BO aim to balance exploration and exploitation. This often involves optimizing non-additive batch acquisition functions, necessitating approximation via myopic construction and/or diversity heuristics. In this work, we propose an acquisition strategy for discrete optimization that is motivated by pure exploitation, qPO (multipoint Probability of Optimality). qPO maximizes the probability that the batch includes the true optimum, which is expressible as the sum over individual acquisition scores and thereby circumvents the combinatorial challenge of optimizing a batch acquisition function. We differentiate the proposed strategy from parallel Thompson sampling and discuss how it implicitly captures diversity. Finally, we apply our method to the model-guided exploration of large chemical libraries and provide empirical evidence that it is competitive with and complements other state-of-the-art methods in batched Bayesian optimization.

Abstract: Analog dynamical accelerators (DXs) are a growing sub-field in computer architecture research, offering order-of-magnitude gains in power efficiency and latency over traditional digital methods in several machine learning, optimization, and sampling tasks. However, limited-capacity accelerators require hybrid analog/digital algorithms to solve real-world problems, commonly using large-neighborhood local search (LNLS) frameworks. Unlike fully digital algorithms, hybrid LNLS has no non-asymptotic convergence guarantees and no principled hyperparameter selection schemes, particularly limiting cross-device training and inference.
  In this work, we provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for hybrid LNLS by reducing to block Langevin Diffusion (BLD) algorithms. Adapting tools from classical sampling theory, we prove exponential KL-divergence convergence for randomized and cyclic block selection strategies using ideal DXs. With finite device variation, we provide explicit bounds on the 2-Wasserstein bias in terms of step duration, noise strength, and function parameters. Our BLD model provides a key link between established theory and novel computing platforms, and our theoretical results provide a closed-form expression linking device variation, algorithm hyperparameters, and performance.

Abstract: Time series imputation is important for numerous real-world applications. To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF). Following the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.

Abstract: We consider reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of problems with bagged decision times. A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times. The transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag. All actions within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed at the end of the bag. For example, in mobile health, multiple activity suggestions in a day collectively affect a user's daily commitment to being active. Our goal is to develop an online RL algorithm to maximize the discounted sum of the bag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian transitions within a bag, we utilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the DAG, we construct states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient statistic of the observed history, which results in Markov state transitions within and across bags. We then formulate this problem as a periodic Markov decision process (MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm based on Bellman equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle periodic MDPs. We show that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal value function among all state constructions for a periodic MDP. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on testbed variants built from real data in a mobile health clinical trial.

Abstract: In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.

Abstract: Electronic maps consist of diverse entities, such as points of interest (POIs), road networks, and land parcels, playing a vital role in applications like ITS and LBS. Map entity representation learning (MapRL) generates versatile and reusable data representations, providing essential tools for efficiently managing and utilizing map entity data. Despite the progress in MapRL, two key challenges constrain further development. First, existing research is fragmented, with models classified by the type of map entity, limiting the reusability of techniques across different tasks. Second, the lack of unified benchmarks makes systematic evaluation and comparison of models difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a novel taxonomy for MapRL that organizes models based on functional module-such as encoders, pre-training tasks, and downstream tasks-rather than by entity type. Building on this taxonomy, we present a taxonomy-driven library, VecCity, which offers easy-to-use interfaces for encoding, pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. The library integrates datasets from nine cities and reproduces 21 mainstream MapRL models, establishing the first standardized benchmarks for the field. VecCity also allows users to modify and extend models through modular components, facilitating seamless experimentation. Our comprehensive experiments cover multiple types of map entities and evaluate 21 VecCity pre-built models across various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VecCity in streamlining model development and provide insights into the impact of various components on performance. By promoting modular design and reusability, VecCity offers a unified framework to advance research and innovation in MapRL. The code is available at https://github.com/Bigscity-VecCity/VecCity.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a method that captures gene expression profiles aligned with spatial coordinates. The discrete spatial distribution and the super-high dimensional sequencing results make ST data challenging to be modeled effectively. In this paper, we manage to model ST in a continuous and compact manner by the proposed tool, SUICA, empowered by the great approximation capability of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that can enhance both the spatial density and the gene expression. Concretely within the proposed SUICA, we incorporate a graph-augmented Autoencoder to effectively model the context information of the unstructured spots and provide informative embeddings that are structure-aware for spatial mapping. We also tackle the extremely skewed distribution in a regression-by-classification fashion and enforce classification-based loss functions for the optimization of SUICA. By extensive experiments of a wide range of common ST platforms under varying degradations, SUICA outperforms both conventional INR variants and SOTA methods regarding numerical fidelity, statistical correlation, and bio-conservation. The prediction by SUICA also showcases amplified gene signatures that enriches the bio-conservation of the raw data and benefits subsequent analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/Szym29/SUICA.

Abstract: Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is critical for integrating renewable energy sources into the grid, optimizing real-time energy management, and ensuring energy reliability amidst increasing demand. However, existing models often struggle with effectively capturing the complex relationships between target variables and covariates, as well as the interactions between temporal dynamics and multivariate data, leading to suboptimal forecasting accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture that leverages the iTransformer for feature extraction from target variables and employs long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract features from covariates. A cross-attention mechanism is integrated to fuse the outputs of both models, followed by a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) mapping for enhanced representation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated using publicly available datasets from Australia, with experiments conducted across four seasons. Results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively capture seasonal variations in PV power generation and improve forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used and impactful distributed optimization framework that achieves consensus through averaging locally trained models. While effective, this approach may not align well with Bayesian inference, where the model space has the structure of a distribution space. Taking an information-geometric perspective, we reinterpret FL aggregation as the problem of finding the barycenter of local posteriors using a prespecified divergence metric, minimizing the average discrepancy across clients. This perspective provides a unifying framework that generalizes many existing methods and offers crisp insights into their theoretical underpinnings. We then propose BA-BFL, an algorithm that retains the convergence properties of Federated Averaging in non-convex settings. In non-independent and identically distributed scenarios, we conduct extensive comparisons with statistical aggregation techniques, showing that BA-BFL achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a geometric interpretation of the aggregation phase. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning, exploring the impact of Bayesian layers on uncertainty quantification and model calibration.

Abstract: Continual Federated Learning (CFL) allows distributed devices to collaboratively learn novel concepts from continuously shifting training data while avoiding knowledge forgetting of previously seen tasks. To tackle this challenge, most current CFL approaches rely on extensive rehearsal of previous data. Despite effectiveness, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data privacy. Considering these, we seek to apply regularization techniques to CFL by considering their cost-efficient properties that do not require sample caching or rehearsal. Specifically, we first apply traditional regularization techniques to CFL and observe that existing regularization techniques, especially synaptic intelligence, can achieve promising results under homogeneous data distribution but fail when the data is heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective regularization algorithm for CFL named FedSSI, which tailors the synaptic intelligence for the CFL with heterogeneous data settings. FedSSI can not only reduce computational overhead without rehearsal but also address the data heterogeneity issue. Extensive experiments show that FedSSI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Traditional Incremental Learning (IL) targets to handle sequential fully-supervised learning problems where novel classes emerge from time to time. However, due to inherent annotation uncertainty and ambiguity, collecting high-quality annotated data in a dynamic learning system can be extremely expensive. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel weakly-supervised learning paradigm called Incremental Partial Label Learning (IPLL), where the sequentially arrived data relate to a set of candidate labels rather than the ground truth. Technically, we develop the Prototype-Guided Disambiguation and Replay Algorithm (PGDR) which leverages the class prototypes as a proxy to mitigate two intertwined challenges in IPLL, i.e., label ambiguity and catastrophic forgetting. To handle the former, PGDR encapsulates a momentum-based pseudo-labeling algorithm along with prototype-guided initialization, resulting in a balanced perception of classes. To alleviate forgetting, we develop a memory replay technique that collects well-disambiguated samples while maintaining representativeness and diversity. By jointly distilling knowledge from curated memory data, our framework exhibits a great disambiguation ability for samples of new tasks and achieves less forgetting of knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGDR achieves superior

Abstract: We analyze two variants of Local Gradient Descent applied to distributed logistic regression with heterogeneous, separable data and show convergence at the rate $O(1/KR)$ for $K$ local steps and sufficiently large $R$ communication rounds. In contrast, all existing convergence guarantees for Local GD applied to any problem are at least $\Omega(1/R)$, meaning they fail to show the benefit of local updates. The key to our improved guarantee is showing progress on the logistic regression objective when using a large stepsize $\eta \gg 1/K$, whereas prior analysis depends on $\eta \leq 1/K$.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular across various visual tasks, and several open-sourced VLM variants have been released. However, selecting the best-performing pre-trained VLM for a specific downstream task is challenging since no single VLM can achieve promising performance on all downstream tasks, and evaluating all available VLMs is impossible due to time and data limitations. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel paradigm to select and reuse VLM for downstream tasks, called Model Label Learning (MLL). The proposal contains three key modules: \emph{model labeling}, which assigns labels to each VLM to describe their specialty and utility; \emph{model selection}, which matches the requirements of the target task with model labels; and \emph{model reuse}, which applies selected VLMs to the target task in an ensemble manner. The proposal is highly computationally efficient and growable since the model labeling process is completed target task independent and the ability could grow with the number of candidate VLMs. We also introduce a new benchmark for evaluating VLM selection methods, including 49 VLMs and 17 target task datasets. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for selecting and reusing VLMs.

Abstract: We introduce FedGVI, a probabilistic Federated Learning (FL) framework that is robust to both prior and likelihood misspecification. FedGVI addresses limitations in both frequentist and Bayesian FL by providing unbiased predictions under model misspecification, with calibrated uncertainty quantification. Our approach generalises previous FL approaches, specifically Partitioned Variational Inference (Ashman et al., 2022), by allowing robust and conjugate updates, decreasing computational complexity at the clients. We offer theoretical analysis in terms of fixed-point convergence, optimality of the cavity distribution, and provable robustness to likelihood misspecification. Further, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FedGVI in terms of improved robustness and predictive performance on multiple synthetic and real world classification data sets.

Abstract: AI models for lung cancer screening are limited by data scarcity, impacting generalizability and clinical applicability. Generative models address this issue but are constrained by training data variability. We introduce SYN-LUNGS, a framework for generating high-quality 3D CT images with detailed annotations. SYN-LUNGS integrates XCAT3 phantoms for digital twin generation, X-Lesions for nodule simulation (varying size, location, and appearance), and DukeSim for CT image formation with vendor and parameter variability. The dataset includes 3,072 nodule images from 1,044 simulated CT scans, with 512 lesions and 174 digital twins. Models trained on clinical + simulated data outperform clinical only models, achieving 10% improvement in detection, 2-9% in segmentation and classification, and enhanced synthesis. By incorporating anatomy-informed simulations, SYN-LUNGS provides a scalable approach for AI model development, particularly in rare disease representation and improving model reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are computationally intensive, particularly during inference. Neuron-adaptive techniques, which selectively activate neurons in Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers, offer some speedups but suffer from limitations in modern Transformers. These include reliance on sparse activations, incompatibility with attention layers, and the use of costly neuron masking techniques. To address these issues, we propose the Adaptive Rank Allocation framework and introduce the Rank and Neuron Allocator (RaNA) adapter. RaNA adapters leverage rank adapters, which operate on linear layers by applying both low-rank matrix decompositions and adaptive masking to efficiently allocate compute without depending on activation sparsity. This enables RaNA to be generally applied to MLPs and linear components of attention modules, while eliminating the need for expensive maskers found in neuron-adaptive methods. Notably, when compared to neuron adapters, RaNA improves perplexity by up to 7 points and increases accuracy by up to 8 percentage-points when reducing FLOPs by $\sim$44% in state-of-the-art Transformer architectures. These results position RaNA as a robust solution for improving inference efficiency in modern Transformer architectures.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks, we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.

Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.

Abstract: Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of interrelated risk factors that significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Despite its global prevalence, accurate prediction of MetS remains challenging due to issues such as class imbalance, data scarcity, and methodological inconsistencies in existing studies. In this paper, we address these challenges by systematically evaluating and optimizing machine learning (ML) models for MetS prediction, leveraging advanced data balancing techniques and counterfactual analysis. Multiple ML models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, TabNet, etc., were trained and compared under various data balancing techniques such as random oversampling (ROS), SMOTE, ADASYN, and CTGAN. Additionally, we introduce MetaBoost, a novel hybrid framework that integrates SMOTE, ADASYN, and CTGAN, optimizing synthetic data generation through weighted averaging and iterative weight tuning to enhance the model's performance (achieving up to a 1.87% accuracy improvement over individual balancing techniques). A comprehensive counterfactual analysis is conducted to quantify the feature-level changes required to shift individuals from high-risk to low-risk categories. The results indicate that blood glucose (50.3%) and triglycerides (46.7%) were the most frequently modified features, highlighting their clinical significance in MetS risk reduction. Additionally, probabilistic analysis shows elevated blood glucose (85.5% likelihood) and triglycerides (74.9% posterior probability) as the strongest predictors. This study not only advances the methodological rigor of MetS prediction but also provides actionable insights for clinicians and researchers, highlighting the potential of ML in mitigating the public health burden of metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Many-shot jailbreaking (MSJ) is an adversarial technique that exploits the long context windows of modern LLMs to circumvent model safety training by including in the prompt many examples of a "fake" assistant responding inappropriately before the final request. With enough examples, the model's in-context learning abilities override its safety training, and it responds as if it were the "fake" assistant. In this work, we probe the effectiveness of different fine-tuning and input sanitization approaches on mitigating MSJ attacks, alone and in combination. We find incremental mitigation effectiveness for each, and show that the combined techniques significantly reduce the effectiveness of MSJ attacks, while retaining model performance in benign in-context learning and conversational tasks. We suggest that our approach could meaningfully ameliorate this vulnerability if incorporated into model safety post-training.

Abstract: The loss landscape of Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNs) is characterized by local minima that grow exponentially with increasing qubits. Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering. The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.

Abstract: We consider the problem of Bayesian optimization (BO) in one dimension, under a Gaussian process prior and Gaussian sampling noise. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that, under fairly mild technical assumptions on the kernel, the best possible cumulative regret up to time $T$ behaves as $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$. This gives a tight characterization up to a $\sqrt{\log T}$ factor, and includes the first non-trivial lower bound for noisy BO. Our assumptions are satisfied, for example, by the squared exponential and Mat\'ern-$\nu$ kernels, with the latter requiring $\nu > 2$. Our results certify the near-optimality of existing bounds (Srinivas {\em et al.}, 2009) for the SE kernel, while proving them to be strictly suboptimal for the Mat\'ern kernel with $\nu > 2$.

Abstract: This paper introduces metrics for welfare analysis in dynamic models. We develop estimation and inference for these parameters even in the presence of a high-dimensional state space. Examples of welfare metrics include average welfare, average marginal welfare effects, and welfare decompositions into direct and indirect effects similar to Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973). We derive dual and doubly robust representations of welfare metrics that facilitate debiased inference. For average welfare, the value function does not have to be estimated. In general, debiasing can be applied to any estimator of the value function, including neural nets, random forests, Lasso, boosting, and other high-dimensional methods. In particular, we derive Lasso and Neural Network estimators of the value function and associated dynamic dual representation and establish associated mean square convergence rates for these functions. Debiasing is automatic in the sense that it only requires knowledge of the welfare metric of interest, not the form of bias correction. The proposed methods are applied to estimate a dynamic behavioral model of teacher absenteeism in \cite{DHR} and associated average teacher welfare.

Abstract: With a growing interest in understanding neural network prediction strategies, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) have emerged as a popular tool for modeling human-understandable concepts in the latent space. Commonly, CAVs are computed by leveraging linear classifiers optimizing the separability of latent representations of samples with and without a given concept. However, in this paper we show that such a separability-oriented computation leads to solutions, which may diverge from the actual goal of precisely modeling the concept direction. This discrepancy can be attributed to the significant influence of distractor directions, i.e., signals unrelated to the concept, which are picked up by filters (i.e., weights) of linear models to optimize class-separability. To address this, we introduce pattern-based CAVs, solely focussing on concept signals, thereby providing more accurate concept directions. We evaluate various CAV methods in terms of their alignment with the true concept direction and their impact on CAV applications, including concept sensitivity testing and model correction for shortcut behavior caused by data artifacts. We demonstrate the benefits of pattern-based CAVs using the Pediatric Bone Age, ISIC2019, and FunnyBirds datasets with VGG, ResNet, ReXNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer as model architectures.

Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an integral component of the blockchain ecosystem, enabling a range of financial activities through smart-contract-based protocols. Traditional DeFi governance typically involves manual parameter adjustments by protocol teams or token holder votes, and is thus prone to human bias and financial risks, undermining the system's integrity and security. While existing efforts aim to establish more adaptive parameter adjustment schemes, there remains a need for a governance model that is both more efficient and resilient to significant market manipulations. In this paper, we introduce "Auto$.$gov", a learning-based governance framework that employs a deep Qnetwork (DQN) reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to perform semi-automated, data-driven parameter adjustments. We create a DeFi environment with an encoded action-state space akin to the Aave lending protocol for simulation and testing purposes, where Auto$.$gov has demonstrated the capability to retain funds that would have otherwise been lost to price oracle attacks. In tests with real-world data, Auto$.$gov outperforms the benchmark approaches by at least 14% and the static baseline model by tenfold, in terms of the preset performance metric--protocol profitability. Overall, the comprehensive evaluations confirm that Auto$.$gov is more efficient and effective than traditional governance methods, thereby enhancing the security, profitability, and ultimately, the sustainability of DeFi protocols.

Abstract: Network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) monitors network traffic for malicious activities, forming the frontline defense against increasing attacks over information infrastructures. Although promising, our quantitative analysis shows that existing methods perform inconsistently in declaring various unknown attacks (e.g., 9% and 35% F1 respectively for two distinct unknown threats for an SVM-based method) or detecting diverse known attacks (e.g., 31% F1 for the Backdoor and 93% F1 for DDoS by a GCN-based state-of-the-art method), and reveals that the underlying cause is entangled distributions of flow features. This motivates us to propose 3D-IDS, a novel method that aims to tackle the above issues through two-step feature disentanglements and a dynamic graph diffusion scheme. Specifically, we first disentangle traffic features by a non-parameterized optimization based on mutual information, automatically differentiating tens and hundreds of complex features of various attacks. Such differentiated features will be fed into a memory model to generate representations, which are further disentangled to highlight the attack-specific features. Finally, we use a novel graph diffusion method that dynamically fuses the network topology for spatial-temporal aggregation in evolving data streams. By doing so, we can effectively identify various attacks in encrypted traffics, including unknown threats and known ones that are not easily detected. Experiments show the superiority of our 3D-IDS. We also demonstrate that our two-step feature disentanglements benefit the explainability of NIDS.

Abstract: Music generation has attracted growing interest with the advancement of deep generative models. However, generating music conditioned on textual descriptions, known as text-to-music, remains challenging due to the complexity of musical structures and high sampling rate requirements. Despite the task's significance, prevailing generative models exhibit limitations in music quality, computational efficiency, and generalization. This paper introduces JEN-1, a universal high-fidelity model for text-to-music generation. JEN-1 is a diffusion model incorporating both autoregressive and non-autoregressive training. Through in-context learning, JEN-1 performs various generation tasks including text-guided music generation, music inpainting, and continuation. Evaluations demonstrate JEN-1's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in text-music alignment and music quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: With the advent of modern AI architectures, a shift has happened towards end-to-end architectures. This pivot has led to neural architectures being trained without domain-specific biases/knowledge, optimized according to the task. We in this paper, learn audio embeddings via diverse feature representations, in this case, domain-specific. For the case of audio classification over hundreds of categories of sound, we learn robust separate embeddings for diverse audio properties such as pitch, timbre, and neural representation, along with also learning it via an end-to-end architecture. We observe handcrafted embeddings, e.g., pitch and timbre-based, although on their own, are not able to beat a fully end-to-end representation, yet adding these together with end-to-end embedding helps us, significantly improve performance. This work would pave the way to bring some domain expertise with end-to-end models to learn robust, diverse representations, surpassing the performance of just training end-to-end models.

Abstract: Visible (VIS) imagery is important for monitoring Tropical Cyclones (TCs) but is unavailable at night. This study presents a Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) model to generate nighttime VIS imagery with significantly enhanced accuracy and spatial resolution. Our method offers three key improvements compared to existing models. First, we replaced the L1 loss in the pix2pix framework with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss, which significantly reduced image blurriness. Second, we selected multispectral infrared (IR) bands as input based on a thorough examination of their spectral properties, providing essential physical information for accurate simulation. Third, we incorporated the direction parameters of the sun and the satellite, which addressed the dependence of VIS images on sunlight directions and enabled a much larger training set from continuous daytime data. The model was trained and validated using data from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) in the daytime, achieving statistical results of SSIM = 0.923 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.0299, which significantly surpasses existing models. We also performed a cross-satellite nighttime model validation using the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which yields outstanding results compared to existing models. Our model is operationally applied to generate accurate VIS imagery with arbitrary virtual sunlight directions, significantly contributing to the nighttime monitoring of various meteorological phenomena.

Abstract: What does it take to build mobile manipulation systems that can competently operate on previously unseen objects in previously unseen environments? This work answers this question using opening of articulated structures as a mobile manipulation testbed. Specifically, our focus is on the end-to-end performance on this task without any privileged information, i.e. the robot starts at a location with the novel target articulated object in view, and has to approach the object and successfully open it. We first develop a system for this task, and then conduct 100+ end-to-end system tests across 13 real world test sites. Our large-scale study reveals a number of surprising findings: a) modular systems outperform end-to-end learned systems for this task, even when the end-to-end learned systems are trained on 1000+ demonstrations, b) perception, and not precise end-effector control, is the primary bottleneck to task success, and c) state-of-the-art articulation parameter estimation models developed in isolation struggle when faced with robot-centric viewpoints. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of developing components of the pipeline in isolation and underscore the need for system-level research, providing a pragmatic roadmap for building generalizable mobile manipulation systems.

<title>Enhancing User Interest based on Stream Clustering and Memory Networks in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RSs) provide personalized recommendation service based on user interest, which are widely used in various platforms. However, there are lots of users with sparse interest due to lacking consumption behaviors, which leads to poor recommendation results for them. This problem is widespread in large-scale RSs and is particularly difficult to address. To solve this challenging problem, we propose an innovative solution called User Interest Enhancement (UIE). UIE enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences by leveraging the enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vectors generated based on dynamic streaming clustering of similar users and items from multiple perspectives, which are stored and updated in memory networks. UIE not only remarkably improves model performance for users with sparse interest, but also delivers notable gains for other users. As an end-to-end solution, UIE is easy to implement on top of existing ranking models. Furthermore, we extend our approach to long-tail items using similar methods, which also yields excellent improvements. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments in a large-scale industrial RS. The results demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms other existing approaches, especially for users with sparse interest. UIE has been deployed in several large-scale RSs at Tencent since 2022, which was made public on 21 May 2024. In addition, UIE-based methods have also been successfully applied in candidate generation, pre-ranking, and context-DNN stages. Multiple teams have developed solutions based on UIE, focusing primarily on updating clustering algorithms and attention mechanisms. As far as we know, UIE has been deployed by many companies. The thoughts of UIE, dynamic streaming clustering and similarity enhancement, have inspired subsequent relevant works.

Abstract: In-context learning based on attention models is examined for data with categorical outcomes, with inference in such models viewed from the perspective of functional gradient descent (GD). We develop a network composed of attention blocks, with each block employing a self-attention layer followed by a cross-attention layer, with associated skip connections. This model can exactly perform multi-step functional GD inference for in-context inference with categorical observations. We perform a theoretical analysis of this setup, generalizing many prior assumptions in this line of work, including the class of attention mechanisms for which it is appropriate. We demonstrate the framework empirically on synthetic data, image classification and language generation.

<title>Towards Universal and Black-Box Query-Response Only Attack on LLMs with QROA</title>

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed critical security and ethical vulnerabilities, particularly their susceptibility to adversarial manipulations. This paper introduces QROA, a novel black-box jailbreak method designed to identify adversarial suffixes that can bypass LLM alignment safeguards when appended to a malicious instruction. Unlike existing suffix-based jailbreak approaches, QROA does not require access to the model's logit or any other internal information. It also eliminates reliance on human-crafted templates, operating solely through the standard query-response interface of LLMs. By framing the attack as an optimization bandit problem, QROA employs a surrogate model and token level optimization to efficiently explore suffix variations. Furthermore, we propose QROA-UNV, an extension that identifies universal adversarial suffixes for individual models, enabling one-query jailbreaks across a wide range of instructions. Testing on multiple models demonstrates Attack Success Rate (ASR) greater than 80\%. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities, emphasize the need for advanced defenses, and contribute to the development of more robust safety evaluations for secure AI deployment.

<title>Optimal Rates of Convergence for Entropy Regularization in Discounted Markov Decision Processes</title>

Abstract: We study the error introduced by entropy regularization in infinite-horizon, discrete, discounted Markov decision processes. We show that this error decreases exponentially in the inverse regularization strength both in a weighted KL-divergence and in value with a problem-specific exponent. This is in contrast to previously known estimates, of the order $O(\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the regularization strength. We provide a lower bound matching our upper bound up to a polynomial term, thereby characterizing the exponential convergence rate for entropy regularization. Our proof relies on the observation that the solutions of entropy-regularized Markov decision processes solve a gradient flow of the unregularized reward with respect to a Riemannian metric common in natural policy gradient methods. This correspondence allows us to identify the limit of this gradient flow as the generalized maximum entropy optimal policy, thereby characterizing the implicit bias of this gradient flow, which corresponds to a time-continuous version of the natural policy gradient method. We use our improved error estimates to show that for entropy-regularized natural policy gradient methods, the overall error decays exponentially in the square root of the number of iterations, improving over existing sublinear guarantees. Finally, we extend our analysis to settings beyond the entropy. In particular, we characterize the implicit bias regarding general convex potentials and their resulting generalized natural policy gradients.

Abstract: In this work, we systematically study music generation conditioned solely on the video. First, we present a large-scale dataset comprising 360K video-music pairs, including various genres such as movie trailers, advertisements, and documentaries. Furthermore, we propose VidMuse, a simple framework for generating music aligned with video inputs. VidMuse stands out by producing high-fidelity music that is both acoustically and semantically aligned with the video. By incorporating local and global visual cues, VidMuse enables the creation of musically coherent audio tracks that consistently match the video content through Long-Short-Term modeling. Through extensive experiments, VidMuse outperforms existing models in terms of audio quality, diversity, and audio-visual alignment. The code and datasets are available at https://vidmuse.github.io/.

Abstract: Synthesizing the voices of unseen speakers remains a persisting challenge in multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS). Existing methods model speaker characteristics through speaker conditioning during training, leading to increased model complexity and limiting reproducibility and accessibility. A lower-complexity method would enable speech synthesis research with limited computational and data resources to reach to a wider use. To this end, we propose SelectTTS, a simple and effective alternative. SelectTTS selects appropriate frames from the target speaker and decodes them using frame-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features. We demonstrate that this approach can effectively capture speaker characteristics for unseen speakers and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art multi-speaker TTS frameworks on both objective and subjective metrics. By directly selecting frames from the target speaker's speech, SelectTTS enables generalization to unseen speakers with significantly lower model complexity. Compared to baselines such as XTTS-v2 and VALL-E, SelectTTS achieves better speaker similarity while reducing model parameters by over 8x and training data requirements by 270x.

<title>Bayesian computation with generative diffusion models by Multilevel Monte Carlo</title>

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful strategy to perform stochastic sampling in Bayesian inverse problems, delivering remarkably accurate solutions for a wide range of challenging applications. However, diffusion models often require a large number of neural function evaluations per sample in order to deliver accurate posterior samples. As a result, using diffusion models as stochastic samplers for Monte Carlo integration in Bayesian computation can be highly computationally expensive, particularly in applications that require a substantial number of Monte Carlo samples for conducting uncertainty quantification analyses. This cost is especially high in large-scale inverse problems such as computational imaging, which rely on large neural networks that are expensive to evaluate. With quantitative imaging applications in mind, this paper presents a Multilevel Monte Carlo strategy that significantly reduces the cost of Bayesian computation with diffusion models. This is achieved by exploiting cost-accuracy trade-offs inherent to diffusion models to carefully couple models of different levels of accuracy in a manner that significantly reduces the overall cost of the calculation, without reducing the final accuracy. The proposed approach achieves a $4\times$-to-$8\times$ reduction in computational cost w.r.t. standard techniques across three benchmark imaging problems.

<title>Vision-Language Models Create Cross-Modal Task Representations</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive vision-language models (VLMs) can handle many tasks within a single model, yet the representations that enable this capability remain opaque. We find that VLMs align conceptually equivalent inputs into a shared task vector, which is invariant to modality (text, image) and format (examples, instruction), and may simplify VLM processing. We measure this alignment via cross-modal transfer -- the ability of a task vector derived in one modality to trigger the correct generation in another -- on a range of tasks and model architectures. Although the task vector is highly compressed, we find that this single vector outperforms prompting the model with the full task information, unique to this cross-modal case. Furthermore, we show that task vectors can be transferred from a base language model to its fine-tuned vision-language counterpart, and that they can be derived solely from instructions without the need for examples. Taken together, our findings shed light on how VLMs internally process task information, and how they map different modalities into common semantic representations.

<title>ASURA-FDPS-ML: Star-by-star Galaxy Simulations Accelerated by Surrogate Modeling for Supernova Feedback</title>

Abstract: We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent. Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of more than about 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback have presented significant bottlenecks in astrophysical simulations across various scales. Overcoming this challenge is crucial for enabling star-by-star galaxy simulations, which aim to capture the dynamics of individual stars and the inhomogeneous shell's expansion within the turbulent ISM. To address this, our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in automated report generation, the opaqueness of text interpretability continues to cast doubt on the reliability of the content produced. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify specific image features in X-ray images that influence the outputs of report generation models. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator CVLM, a module to generate a manipulated X-ray from an original X-ray and its report from a designated report generator. The essence of CVLM is that cycling manipulated X-rays to the report generator produces altered reports aligned with the alterations pre-injected into the reports for X-ray generation, achieving the term "cyclic manipulation". This process allows direct comparison between original and manipulated X-rays, clarifying the critical image features driving changes in reports and enabling model users to assess the reliability of the generated texts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CVLM can identify more precise and reliable features compared to existing explanation methods, significantly enhancing the transparency and applicability of AI-generated reports.

Abstract: Understanding the properties of excited states of complex molecules is crucial for many chemical and physical processes. Calculating these properties is often significantly more resource-intensive than calculating their ground state counterparts. We present a quantum machine learning model that predicts excited-state properties from the molecular ground state for different geometric configurations. The model comprises a symmetry-invariant quantum neural network and a conventional neural network and is able to provide accurate predictions with only a few training data points. The proposed procedure is fully NISQ compatible. This is achieved by using a quantum circuit that requires a number of parameters linearly proportional to the number of molecular orbitals, along with a parameterized measurement observable, thereby reducing the number of necessary measurements. We benchmark the algorithm on three different molecules with three different system sizes: $H_2$ with four orbitals, LiH with five orbitals, and $H_4$ with six orbitals. For these molecules, we predict the excited state transition energies and transition dipole moments. We show that, in many cases, the procedure is able to outperform various classical models (support vector machines, Gaussian processes, and neural networks) that rely solely on classical features, by up to two orders of magnitude in the test mean squared error.

Abstract: We develop a univariate, differentially private mean estimator, called the private modified winsorized mean, designed to be used as the aggregator in subsample-and-aggregate. We demonstrate, via real data analysis, that common differentially private multivariate mean estimators may not perform well as the aggregator, even in large datasets, motivating our developments.We show that the modified winsorized mean is minimax optimal for several, large classes of distributions, even under adversarial contamination. We also demonstrate that, empirically, the private modified winsorized mean performs well compared to other private mean estimates. We consider the modified winsorized mean as the aggregator in subsample-and-aggregate, deriving a finite sample deviations bound for a subsample-and-aggregate estimate generated with the new aggregator. This result yields two important insights: (i) the optimal choice of subsamples depends on the bias of the estimator computed on the subsamples, and (ii) the rate of convergence of the subsample-and-aggregate estimator depends on the robustness of the estimator computed on the subsamples.

Abstract: The emergence of abstract rules from exemplars is a cornerstone of genuine intelligence in both biological and artificial systems. However, the internal organizational principles underlying different abstract rules remain poorly understood. We propose a hierarchically modulated recurrent spiking neural network (HM-RSNN), inspired by astrocyte signaling. The model globally configures and locally fine-tunes intrinsic neuronal properties via a two-stage neuromodulatory mechanism. This design enhances neuronal adaptability and diversity, thus enabling fine-grained analysis of internal organizational principles. We evaluate abstract rule emergence across four cognitive task sets. To probe internal organization, we examine network-level connectivity via structural modularity analysis and neuron-level functional biases via bin-wise lesion studies based on intrinsic properties. Our experiments show that HM-RSNN successfully achieves abstract rule emergence, with rule-contingent organizational principles evident at both network and neuron levels. These findings highlight the critical role of dynamic internal organization in supporting flexible cognition.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to address the unmet demand for automated prompting and enhanced human-model interactions of SAM and SAM2 for the sake of promoting their widespread clinical adoption. Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.

Abstract: Scaling Large Language Model (LLM) training relies on multi-dimensional parallelism, where High-Bandwidth Domains (HBDs) are critical for communication-intensive parallelism like Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP). However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs).
  We propose InfiniteHBD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfiniteHBD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfiniteHBD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, and their application in edge scenarios has attracted significant attention. However, sparse-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which are well suited for edge scenarios, have received relatively little attention due to their high memory demands. Offload-based methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert prediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference delays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose Fate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is that gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert prefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU overhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy that increases the expert hit rate to 99\%. Additionally, Fate integrates tailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency. Experimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert Activation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in prefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively, while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, Fate's performance improvements are scalable across different memory budgets.

Abstract: Transformers with linear recurrent modeling offer linear-time training and constant-memory inference. Despite their demonstrated efficiency and performance, pretraining such non-standard architectures from scratch remains costly and risky. The linearization of large language models (LLMs) transforms pretrained standard models into linear recurrent structures, enabling more efficient deployment. However, current linearization methods typically introduce additional feature map modules that require extensive fine-tuning and overlook the gating mechanisms used in state-of-the-art linear recurrent models. To address these issues, this paper presents Liger, short for Linearizing LLMs to gated recurrent structures. Liger is a novel approach for converting pretrained LLMs into gated linear recurrent models without adding extra parameters. It repurposes the pretrained key matrix weights to construct diverse gating mechanisms, facilitating the formation of various gated recurrent structures while avoiding the need to train additional components from scratch. Using lightweight fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Liger restores the performance of the linearized gated recurrent models to match that of the original LLMs. Additionally, we introduce Liger Attention, an intra-layer hybrid attention mechanism, which significantly recovers 93\% of the Transformer-based LLM at 0.02\% pre-training tokens during the linearization process, achieving competitive results across multiple benchmarks, as validated on models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linearization.

<title>Grokking in the Wild: Data Augmentation for Real-World Multi-Hop Reasoning with Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio $\phi_r$ of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA - substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing $\phi_r$ drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.

Abstract: LLM-integrated app systems extend the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with third-party apps that are invoked by a system LLM using interleaved planning and execution phases to answer user queries. These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution.
  In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is pivotal in enhancing the robustness, reliability, and interpretability of Machine Learning (ML) systems for healthcare, optimizing resources and improving patient care. Despite the emergence of ML-based clinical decision support tools, the lack of principled quantification of uncertainty in ML models remains a major challenge. Current reviews have a narrow focus on analyzing the state-of-the-art UQ in specific healthcare domains without systematically evaluating method efficacy across different stages of model development, and despite a growing body of research, its implementation in healthcare applications remains limited. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of current UQ in healthcare, offering an informed framework that highlights how different methods can be integrated into each stage of the ML pipeline including data processing, training and evaluation. We also highlight the most popular methods used in healthcare and novel approaches from other domains that hold potential for future adoption in the medical context. We expect this study will provide a clear overview of the challenges and opportunities of implementing UQ in the ML pipeline for healthcare, guiding researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable techniques to enhance the reliability, safety and trust from patients and clinicians on ML-driven healthcare solutions.

Summary:
Plant disease recognition is crucial for agricultural production. Traditional methods are inaccurate and inefficient, prompting the use of deep learning techniques. However, running these models on edge devices presents challenges due to inference delays and high energy consumption. To address this, a collaborative inference framework between edge devices and cloud servers is proposed. A pruned DNN model using reinforcement learning improves inference speed and reduces energy consumption. The optimal split point is determined through a greedy strategy for efficient collaboration.

Abstract: Plant disease is a critical factor affecting agricultural production. Traditional manual recognition methods face significant drawbacks, including low accuracy, high costs, and inefficiency. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant benefits in identifying plant diseases, but they still face challenges such as inference delays and high energy consumption. Deep learning algorithms are difficult to run on resource-limited embedded devices. Offloading these models to cloud servers is confronted with the restriction of communication bandwidth, and all of these factors will influence the inference's efficiency. We propose a collaborative inference framework for recognizing plant diseases between edge devices and cloud servers to enhance inference speed. The DNN model for plant disease recognition is pruned through deep reinforcement learning to improve the inference speed and reduce energy consumption. Then the optimal split point is determined by a greedy strategy to achieve the best collaborated inference acceleration. Finally, the system for collaborative inference acceleration in plant disease recognition has been implemented using Gradio to facilitate friendly human-machine interaction. Experiments indicate that the proposed collaborative inference framework significantly increases inference speed while maintaining acceptable recognition accuracy, offering a novel solution for rapidly diagnosing and preventing plant diseases.

Abstract: Predicting financial time series presents significant challenges due to inherent low signal-to-noise ratios and intricate temporal patterns. Traditional machine learning models exhibit limitations in this forecasting task constrained by their restricted model capacity. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), with their greatly expanded parameter spaces, demonstrate promising potential for modeling complex dependencies in temporal sequences. However, existing LLM-based approaches typically focus on fixed-length patch analysis due to the Transformer architecture, ignoring market data's multi-scale pattern characteristics. In this study, we propose $LLM4FTS$, a novel framework that enhances LLM capabilities for temporal sequence modeling through learnable patch segmentation and dynamic wavelet convolution modules. Specifically,we first employ K-means++ clustering based on DTW distance to identify scale-invariant patterns in market data. Building upon pattern recognition results, we introduce adaptive patch segmentation that partitions temporal sequences while preserving maximal pattern integrity. To accommodate time-varying frequency characteristics, we devise a dynamic wavelet convolution module that emulates discrete wavelet transformation with enhanced flexibility in capturing time-frequency features. These three modules work together to improve large language model's ability to handle scale-invariant patterns in financial time series. Extensive experiments on real-world financial datasets substantiate the framework's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance in capturing complex market patterns and achieving state-of-the-art results in stock return prediction. The successful deployment in practical trading systems confirms its real-world applicability, representing a significant advancement in LLM applications for financial forecasting.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning is fundamentally limited by the quality of their pre-training corpora. We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.

The paper discusses the importance of unlearning in large language models (LLMs) for ensuring data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment. It distinguishes unlearning from obfuscation and introduces a probing-based evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness of existing unlearning methods. The proposed DF-MCQ method flattens the model predictive distribution over generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence to remove knowledge about target individuals and induce refusal behavior. Experimental results show that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with a high refusal rate and uncertainty level, surpassing obfuscation on probing questions. The study highlights the significance of true knowledge removal in unlearning processes for enhancing model security and compliance with privacy regulations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Unlearning has emerged as a critical capability for large language models (LLMs) to support data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment. Recent techniques often rely on obfuscation by injecting incorrect or irrelevant information to suppress knowledge. Such methods effectively constitute knowledge addition rather than true removal, often leaving models vulnerable to probing. In this paper, we formally distinguish unlearning from obfuscation and introduce a probing-based evaluation framework to assess whether existing approaches genuinely remove targeted information. Moreover, we propose DF-MCQ, a novel unlearning method that flattens the model predictive distribution over automatically generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence, effectively removing knowledge about target individuals and triggering appropriate refusal behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level uncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions.

Summary:
The article introduces the Noise-to-Meaning Recursive Self-Improvement (N2M-RSI) model, which demonstrates that when an AI agent utilizes its own outputs as inputs and surpasses a certain information-integration threshold, its internal complexity will grow indefinitely. This framework combines concepts from large language models, Godelian self-reference, and AutoML without being tied to a specific implementation. The model can also be extended to interactions between multiple agents, suggesting potential super-linear effects with communication. To prioritize safety, specific implementation details are omitted, with only a brief, model-agnostic prototype provided in the appendix. <div>

Abstract: We present Noise-to-Meaning Recursive Self-Improvement (N2M-RSI), a minimal formal model showing that once an AI agent feeds its own outputs back as inputs and crosses an explicit information-integration threshold, its internal complexity will grow without bound under our assumptions. The framework unifies earlier ideas on self-prompting large language models, G\"odelian self-reference, and AutoML, yet remains implementation-agnostic. The model furthermore scales naturally to interacting swarms of agents, hinting at super-linear effects once communication among instances is permitted. For safety reasons, we omit system-specific implementation details and release only a brief, model-agnostic toy prototype in Appendix C.

<div> machine learning, sepsis, early detection, Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL), population bias 

Summary:<br /><br />Sepsis is a critical medical condition that requires early detection to prevent severe outcomes. Existing models for sepsis prediction lack consistency in the features they use, hindering their effectiveness across different settings. The Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL) method aims to address this by identifying and focusing on the most important features common across studies. Additionally, FATL combats population bias by incorporating knowledge from models trained on diverse populations in a weighted manner. This approach enhances the generalizability and effectiveness of the system for early sepsis detection. By improving early detection, FATL has the potential to enhance patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare delivery, particularly in resource-limited hospital settings. <div>
arXiv:2505.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening medical condition that occurs when the body has an extreme response to infection, leading to widespread inflammation, organ failure, and potentially death. Because sepsis can worsen rapidly, early detection is critical to saving lives. However, current diagnostic methods often identify sepsis only after significant damage has already occurred. Our project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based system to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more time to intervene.
  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient information or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab results. This inconsistency makes models difficult to compare and limits their ability to work across different hospitals and settings. To solve this, we propose a method called Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL), which identifies and focuses on the most important and commonly reported features across multiple studies, ensuring the model remains consistent and clinically relevant.
  Most existing models are trained on narrow patient groups, leading to population bias. FATL addresses this by combining knowledge from models trained on diverse populations, using a weighted approach that reflects each models contribution. This makes the system more generalizable and effective across different patient demographics and clinical environments. FATL offers a practical and scalable solution for early sepsis detection, particularly in hospitals with limited resources, and has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare delivery.

- The system utilizes a wave index, which is an Attention-aWare VEctor index, to efficiently retrieve important tokens while taking into account attention sparsity. <br />

arXiv:2505.02922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing context lengths of large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges for efficient inference, primarily due to GPU memory and bandwidth constraints. We present RetroInfer, a novel system that reconceptualizes the key-value (KV) cache as a vector storage system which exploits the inherent attention sparsity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. At its core is the wave index, an Attention-aWare VEctor index that enables efficient and accurate retrieval of critical tokens through techniques such as tripartite attention approximation, accuracy-bounded attention estimation, and segmented clustering. Complementing this is the wave buffer, which coordinates KV cache placement and overlaps computation and data transfer across GPU and CPU to sustain high throughput. Unlike prior sparsity-based methods that struggle with token selection and hardware coordination, RetroInfer delivers robust performance without compromising model accuracy. Experiments on long-context benchmarks show up to 4.5X speedup over full attention within GPU memory limits and up to 10.5X over sparse attention baselines when KV cache is extended to CPU memory, all while preserving full-attention-level accuracy.

Summary: 
The study examines the design and application of prediction markets by comparing the Duality-based Cost Function Market Maker (DCFMM) with the proposed Smooth Quadratic Prediction Market. The new market incentivizes agents to implement general steepest gradient descent, offering a better worst-case monetary loss for AD securities while maintaining key guarantees such as price existence and no arbitrage. Trading behavior is analyzed under realistic constraints of bounded budgets and buy-only securities. An approach for adaptive liquidity in the Smooth Quadratic AD Prediction Market is outlined, suggesting a separation of price update rule and fee structure to maintain guarantees. The research showcases potential future designs for prediction markets while preserving key features and ensuring incentive compatibility. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: When agents trade in a Duality-based Cost Function prediction market, they collectively implement the learning algorithm Follow-The-Regularized-Leader. We ask whether other learning algorithms could be used to inspire the design of prediction markets. By decomposing and modifying the Duality-based Cost Function Market Maker's (DCFMM) pricing mechanism, we propose a new prediction market, called the Smooth Quadratic Prediction Market, the incentivizes agents to collectively implement general steepest gradient descent. Relative to the DCFMM, the Smooth Quadratic Prediction Market has a better worst-case monetary loss for AD securities while preserving axiom guarantees such as the existence of instantaneous price, information incorporation, expressiveness, no arbitrage, and a form of incentive compatibility. To motivate the application of the Smooth Quadratic Prediction Market, we independently examine agents' trading behavior under two realistic constraints: bounded budgets and buy-only securities. Finally, we provide an introductory analysis of an approach to facilitate adaptive liquidity using the Smooth Quadratic AD Prediction Market. Our results suggest future designs where the price update rule is separate from the fee structure, yet guarantees are preserved.

Abstract: Machine learning-based surrogate models have emerged as a powerful tool to accelerate simulation-driven scientific workflows. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the lack of large-scale, diverse, and standardized datasets tailored to physics-based simulations. While existing initiatives provide valuable contributions, many are limited in scope-focusing on specific physics domains, relying on fragmented tooling, or adhering to overly simplistic datamodels that restrict generalization. To address these limitations, we introduce PLAID (Physics-Learning AI Datamodel), a flexible and extensible framework for representing and sharing datasets of physics simulations. PLAID defines a unified standard for describing simulation data and is accompanied by a library for creating, reading, and manipulating complex datasets across a wide range of physical use cases (gitlab.com/drti/plaid). We release six carefully crafted datasets under the PLAID standard, covering structural mechanics and computational fluid dynamics, and provide baseline benchmarks using representative learning methods. Benchmarking tools are made available on Hugging Face, enabling direct participation by the community and contribution to ongoing evaluation efforts (huggingface.co/PLAIDcompetitions).

Summary:
2SED Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (2SEDFOSGD) integrates the Two-Scale Effective Dimension (2SED) algorithm with FOSGD to adapt the fractional exponent based on data. This approach dynamically adjusts the exponent to improve convergence by tracking model sensitivity and effective dimensionality, avoiding oscillations and instability. The method retains the benefits of fractional memory for non-convex optimization problems without the slow or erratic behavior of traditional fractional SGD. Empirical evaluations using an autoregressive model show faster convergence and more robust parameter estimates compared to baseline methods under Gaussian and $\alpha$-stable noise scenarios. The results demonstrate the potential of dimension-aware fractional techniques for enhancing modeling and estimation tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fractional-order stochastic gradient descent (FOSGD) leverages fractional exponents to capture long-memory effects in optimization. However, its utility is often limited by the difficulty of tuning and stabilizing these exponents. We propose 2SED Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (2SEDFOSGD), which integrates the Two-Scale Effective Dimension (2SED) algorithm with FOSGD to adapt the fractional exponent in a data-driven manner. By tracking model sensitivity and effective dimensionality, 2SEDFOSGD dynamically modulates the exponent to mitigate oscillations and hasten convergence. Theoretically, for onoconvex optimization problems, this approach preserves the advantages of fractional memory without the sluggish or unstable behavior observed in na\"ive fractional SGD. Empirical evaluations in Gaussian and $\alpha$-stable noise scenarios using an autoregressive (AR) model highlight faster convergence and more robust parameter estimates compared to baseline methods, underscoring the potential of dimension-aware fractional techniques for advanced modeling and estimation tasks.

<div> hash grid, neural fields, signal-fitting capabilities, multi-resolution, domain manipulation

Summary:
The article introduces a new perspective on the working principle of the hash grid structure in the Instant-NGP architecture, a state-of-the-art neural fields design. By framing the hash grid as a means of domain manipulation, the authors aim to explain how this structure enhances the expressivity of the neural network by creating multiple linear segments. Empirical experiments on 1-dimensional signals support this perspective, highlighting the grid's role in learning target signals. The study also addresses the issue of hyperparameter tuning in Instant-NGP, emphasizing the lack of principled understanding in current approaches. While the analysis primarily focuses on 1-dimensional signals, the proposed concept of domain manipulation is suggested to be applicable to higher dimensions as well. <div>
arXiv:2505.03042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instant-NGP has been the state-of-the-art architecture of neural fields in recent years. Its incredible signal-fitting capabilities are generally attributed to its multi-resolution hash grid structure and have been used and improved in numerous following works. However, it is unclear how and why such a hash grid structure improves the capabilities of a neural network by such great margins. A lack of principled understanding of the hash grid also implies that the large set of hyperparameters accompanying Instant-NGP could only be tuned empirically without much heuristics. To provide an intuitive explanation of the working principle of the hash grid, we propose a novel perspective, namely domain manipulation. This perspective provides a ground-up explanation of how the feature grid learns the target signal and increases the expressivity of the neural field by artificially creating multiples of pre-existing linear segments. We conducted numerous experiments on carefully constructed 1-dimensional signals to support our claims empirically and aid our illustrations. While our analysis mainly focuses on 1-dimensional signals, we show that the idea is generalizable to higher dimensions.

Recent developments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate structured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and streamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities across the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total projects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These projects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property prediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel interfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data management and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature. Collectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile predictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools, and much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary LLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data, and new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data environments and interdisciplinary research.

Summary:  
This paper discusses the importance of multimodal models in Artificial Intelligence and the vulnerabilities they inherit from multiple modalities. It emphasizes the need for a practitioner-focused view on adversarial attacks in the multimodal world to help Machine Learning Practitioners adopt and deploy open-source models effectively. The survey covers adversarial attacks targeting text, image, video, and audio modalities, providing a comprehensive view of the evolving threat landscape. This is the first comprehensive summary of adversarial attacks in the multimodal world, highlighting the importance of understanding and addressing these threats for the security and robustness of multimodal models.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of multimodal models is a huge step forward in Artificial Intelligence. A single model is trained to understand multiple modalities: text, image, video, and audio. Open-source multimodal models have made these breakthroughs more accessible. However, considering the vast landscape of adversarial attacks across these modalities, these models also inherit vulnerabilities of all the modalities, and ultimately, the adversarial threat amplifies. While broad research is available on possible attacks within or across these modalities, a practitioner-focused view that outlines attack types remains absent in the multimodal world. As more Machine Learning Practitioners adopt, fine-tune, and deploy open-source models in real-world applications, it's crucial that they can view the threat landscape and take the preventive actions necessary. This paper addresses the gap by surveying adversarial attacks targeting all four modalities: text, image, video, and audio. This survey provides a view of the adversarial attack landscape and presents how multimodal adversarial threats have evolved. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive summarization of the threat landscape in the multimodal world.

Summary:<br />
This research explores the use of Deep Learning (DL) models in the renewable energy domain due to the unpredictability and complexity of renewable energy sources. DL models are favored over traditional machine learning models for their ability to capture complex interactions among variables. Factors affecting DL model accuracy such as sampling, stationarity, and hyperparameter optimization are examined, with LSTM and MLP models showing superior performance. The study evaluates seven ML methods on weather and power generation datasets from Spain, utilizing regularization techniques to address overfitting issues. The research highlights the importance of developing robust methods for renewable energy applications, with LSTM and MLP models emerging as effective solutions for predicting power output from renewable sources. The study provides valuable insights into optimizing DL techniques for improved accuracy in renewable energy forecasting. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Unpredictability of renewable energy sources coupled with the complexity of those methods used for various purposes in this area calls for the development of robust methods such as DL models within the renewable energy domain. Given the nonlinear relationships among variables in renewable energy datasets, DL models are preferred over traditional machine learning (ML) models because they can effectively capture and model complex interactions between variables. This research aims to identify the factors responsible for the accuracy of DL techniques, such as sampling, stationarity, linearity, and hyperparameter optimization for different algorithms. The proposed DL framework compares various methods and alternative training/test ratios. Seven ML methods, such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), CNN-LSTM, Deep Neural Network (DNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Encoder-Decoder (ED), were evaluated on two different datasets. The first dataset contains the weather and power generation data. It encompasses two distinct datasets, hourly energy demand data and hourly weather data in Spain, while the second dataset includes power output generated by the photovoltaic panels at 12 locations. This study deploys regularization approaches, including early stopping, neuron dropping, and L2 regularization, to reduce the overfitting problem associated with DL models. The LSTM and MLP models show superior performance. Their validation data exhibit exceptionally low root mean square error values.

Summary: 
Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is crucial for efficient spectrum management and robust wireless communications. Traditional signal processing techniques are integrated with Large-Language Models (LLMs) in a novel framework to address AMC. Higher-order statistics and cumulant estimation are used to convert signal features into natural language prompts for the LLMs. By including exemplar contexts in the prompts, the LLMs can effectively classify signals in a single shot without the need for additional training or preprocessing. Experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets show that the framework performs well under various modulation schemes and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). This approach lays the groundwork for robust foundation models in wireless communication that can adapt to diverse channel conditions, reducing the cost associated with developing channel-specific models. The framework opens up possibilities for scalable, interpretable, and versatile signal classification systems in next-generation wireless networks. <div>

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is critical for efficient spectrum management and robust wireless communications. However, AMC remains challenging due to the complex interplay of signal interference and noise. In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates traditional signal processing techniques with Large-Language Models (LLMs) to address AMC. Our approach leverages higher-order statistics and cumulant estimation to convert quantitative signal features into structured natural language prompts. By incorporating exemplar contexts into these prompts, our method exploits the LLM's inherent familiarity with classical signal processing, enabling effective one-shot classification without additional training or preprocessing (e.g., denoising). Experimental evaluations on synthetically generated datasets, spanning both noiseless and noisy conditions, demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance across diverse modulation schemes and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Moreover, our approach paves the way for robust foundation models in wireless communications across varying channel conditions, significantly reducing the expense associated with developing channel-specific models. This work lays the foundation for scalable, interpretable, and versatile signal classification systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach to multi-label classification (MLC) that addresses the challenges of heavy class imbalance and noise in data. By incorporating an adaptive thresholding mechanism that combines global and local signals, the proposed model produces per-label, per-instance thresholds for more accurate predictions. Instead of using hard cutoffs, these thresholds are treated as differentiable penalties in the loss function, ensuring smoother supervision and improved calibration. The architecture is lightweight, interpretable, and modular, making it accessible for various applications. On the AmazonCat-13K benchmark dataset, the model achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.1712, surpassing tree-based and pretrained transformer-based methods. The researchers have made their code available for reproducibility and future research. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) requires predicting multiple labels per sample, often under heavy class imbalance and noisy conditions. Traditional approaches apply fixed thresholds or treat labels independently, overlooking context and global rarity. We introduce an adaptive thresholding mechanism that fuses global (IDF-based) and local (KNN-based) signals to produce per-label, per-instance thresholds. Instead of applying these as hard cutoffs, we treat them as differentiable penalties in the loss, providing smooth supervision and better calibration. Our architecture is lightweight, interpretable, and highly modular. On the AmazonCat-13K benchmark, it achieves a macro-F1 of 0.1712, substantially outperforming tree-based and pretrained transformer-based methods. We release full code for reproducibility and future extensions.

<div> Policy gradient, Linear function approximation, Softmax, Convergence, Stochastic bandit<br />
Summary:<br />
Policy gradient methods, commonly used in reinforcement learning, often rely on function approximation to handle large state-action spaces. This study focuses on Softmax PG with linear function approximation (Lin-SPG) and investigates the impact of approximation error on global convergence. Surprisingly, the approximation error is found to be irrelevant for the algorithm's global convergence, even in the stochastic bandit setting. The study identifies necessary and sufficient conditions on the feature representation that guarantee asymptotic global convergence of Lin-SPG. It is proven that Lin-SPG, with problem-specific learning rates and under specific feature conditions, converges to the optimal policy at a rate of O(1/T) after T iterations. Additionally, it is shown that Lin-SPG with any constant learning rate can ensure asymptotic global convergence to the optimal policy. <div>
arXiv:2505.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods have played an essential role in the empirical successes of reinforcement learning. In order to handle large state-action spaces, PG methods are typically used with function approximation. In this setting, the approximation error in modeling problem-dependent quantities is a key notion for characterizing the global convergence of PG methods. We focus on Softmax PG with linear function approximation (referred to as $\texttt{Lin-SPG}$) and demonstrate that the approximation error is irrelevant to the algorithm's global convergence even for the stochastic bandit setting. Consequently, we first identify the necessary and sufficient conditions on the feature representation that can guarantee the asymptotic global convergence of $\texttt{Lin-SPG}$. Under these feature conditions, we prove that $T$ iterations of $\texttt{Lin-SPG}$ with a problem-specific learning rate result in an $O(1/T)$ convergence to the optimal policy. Furthermore, we prove that $\texttt{Lin-SPG}$ with any arbitrary constant learning rate can ensure asymptotic global convergence to the optimal policy.

This paper addresses the challenges of reproducibility in deep learning models, highlighting the importance of reliability and validity in software development. The difficulty in reproducing results may stem from differences in execution environments, software libraries, proprietary data, lack of transparency, and stochastic nature. A systematic approach is presented, including guidelines such as replicating the original software environment, implementing end-to-end training algorithms, disclosing architectural designs, and enhancing transparency in data processing. The study also emphasizes the need for sensitivity analysis to understand model performance across diverse conditions.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of deep learning has witnessed significant breakthroughs, spanning various applications, and fundamentally transforming current software capabilities. However, alongside these advancements, there have been increasing concerns about reproducing the results of these deep learning methods. This is significant because reproducibility is the foundation of reliability and validity in software development, particularly in the rapidly evolving domain of deep learning. The difficulty of reproducibility may arise due to several reasons, including having differences from the original execution environment, incompatible software libraries, proprietary data and source code, lack of transparency, and the stochastic nature in some software. A study conducted by the Nature journal reveals that more than 70% of researchers failed to reproduce other researchers experiments and over 50% failed to reproduce their own experiments. Irreproducibility of deep learning poses significant challenges for researchers and practitioners. To address these concerns, this paper presents a systematic approach at analyzing and improving the reproducibility of deep learning models by demonstrating these guidelines using a case study. We illustrate the patterns and anti-patterns involved with these guidelines for improving the reproducibility of deep learning models. These guidelines encompass establishing a methodology to replicate the original software environment, implementing end-to-end training and testing algorithms, disclosing architectural designs, and enhancing transparency in data processing and training pipelines. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand the model performance across diverse conditions. By implementing these strategies, we aim to bridge the gap between research and practice, so that innovations in deep learning can be effectively reproduced and deployed within software.

arXiv:2505.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hindsight relabeling is a powerful tool for overcoming sparsity in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), especially in certain domains such as navigation and locomotion. However, hindsight relabeling can struggle in object-centric domains. For example, suppose that the goal space consists of a robotic arm pushing a particular target block to a goal location. In this case, hindsight relabeling will give high rewards to any trajectory that does not interact with the block. However, these behaviors are only useful when the object is already at the goal -- an extremely rare case in practice. A dataset dominated by these kinds of trajectories can complicate learning and lead to failures. In object-centric domains, one key intuition is that meaningful trajectories are often characterized by object-object interactions such as pushing the block with the gripper. To leverage this intuition, we introduce Hindsight Relabeling using Interactions (HInt), which combines interactions with hindsight relabeling to improve the sample efficiency of downstream RL. However because interactions do not have a consensus statistical definition tractable for downstream GCRL, we propose a definition of interactions based on the concept of null counterfactual: a cause object is interacting with a target object if, in a world where the cause object did not exist, the target object would have different transition dynamics. We leverage this definition to infer interactions in Null Counterfactual Interaction Inference (NCII), which uses a "nulling'' operation with a learned model to infer interactions. NCII is able to achieve significantly improved interaction inference accuracy in both simple linear dynamics domains and dynamic robotic domains in Robosuite, Robot Air Hockey, and Franka Kitchen and HInt improves sample efficiency by up to 4x.

Summary:
The article introduces the Risk-Adjustable Driving Environment (RADE), a simulation framework for generating safety-critical scenarios in high-fidelity simulations for testing autonomous vehicles. RADE uses a multi-agent diffusion architecture to model the behavior of all agents in the environment and conditions their trajectories based on a risk measure. Unlike traditional methods, RADE learns risk-conditioned behaviors from data, maintaining naturalistic interactions with controllable risk levels. Additionally, a tokenized dynamics check module ensures physical plausibility by efficiently filtering generated trajectories. Validated on the real-world rounD dataset, RADE maintains statistical realism across varying risk levels and increases the likelihood of safety-critical events as risk levels increase. This research demonstrates RADE's potential as a scalable and realistic tool for evaluating autonomous vehicle safety.

Abstract: Generating safety-critical scenarios in high-fidelity simulations offers a promising and cost-effective approach for efficient testing of autonomous vehicles. Existing methods typically rely on manipulating a single vehicle's trajectory through sophisticated designed objectives to induce adversarial interactions, often at the cost of realism and scalability. In this work, we propose the Risk-Adjustable Driving Environment (RADE), a simulation framework that generates statistically realistic and risk-adjustable traffic scenes. Built upon a multi-agent diffusion architecture, RADE jointly models the behavior of all agents in the environment and conditions their trajectories on a surrogate risk measure. Unlike traditional adversarial methods, RADE learns risk-conditioned behaviors directly from data, preserving naturalistic multi-agent interactions with controllable risk levels. To ensure physical plausibility, we incorporate a tokenized dynamics check module that efficiently filters generated trajectories using a motion vocabulary. We validate RADE on the real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating that it preserves statistical realism across varying risk levels and naturally increases the likelihood of safety-critical events as the desired risk level grows up. Our results highlight RADE's potential as a scalable and realistic tool for AV safety evaluation.

Summary: 
This research introduces a method to improve the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) in interactive environments by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. While VLMs hold the potential for tasks requiring visual reasoning, they currently lag behind large language models (LLMs) in certain aspects, such as conforming to output syntax requirements. By incorporating supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on task-specific expert demonstrations and adopting an offline-to-online RL approach, the proposed method aims to overcome these limitations. Through off-policy RL, the VLM-based agents can learn from their own mistakes or from more capable models, enhancing their performance in various multi-modal agent domains. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach across three different interactive environments, showcasing the potential for self-improvement and adaptability in VLM-based agents.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research looks to harness the general knowledge and reasoning of large language models (LLMs) into agents that accomplish user-specified goals in interactive environments. Vision-language models (VLMs) extend LLMs to multi-modal data and provide agents with the visual reasoning necessary for new applications in areas such as computer automation. However, agent tasks emphasize skills where accessible open-weight VLMs lag behind their LLM equivalents. For example, VLMs are less capable of following an environment's strict output syntax requirements and are more focused on open-ended question answering. Overcoming these limitations requires supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on task-specific expert demonstrations. Our work approaches these challenges from an offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) perspective. RL lets us fine-tune VLMs to agent tasks while learning from the unsuccessful decisions of our own model or more capable (larger) models. We explore an off-policy RL solution that retains the stability and simplicity of the widely used SFT workflow while allowing our agent to self-improve and learn from low-quality datasets. We demonstrate this technique with two open-weight VLMs across three multi-modal agent domains.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, consistency models, data generation, convergence, sampling

Summary:
Diffusion models are successful in generating data but are computationally expensive due to iterative sampling. Consistency models aim to directly map noise to data for faster generation. This paper analyzes the convergence of consistency models when the self-consistency property is approximately satisfied in the training distribution. The analysis applies to forward processes under mild data assumptions. For target distributions with bounded support or fast-decaying tails, generated samples are close to the target in Wasserstein distance. When the target distribution is smooth, additional perturbation steps can ensure generated samples are close in total variation distance. Case studies demonstrate the advantages of multistep sampling in consistency models. <br /><br />Summary: Diffusion models are powerful but computationally expensive for data generation. Consistency models offer fast one-step generation with multistep sampling for improved quality. This paper's analysis explores convergence under approximate self-consistency, showing close approximation of target distributions in Wasserstein and total variation distances. Two case studies illustrate the benefits of multistep sampling. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models accomplish remarkable success in data generation tasks across various domains. However, the iterative sampling process is computationally expensive. Consistency models are proposed to learn consistency functions to map from noise to data directly, which allows one-step fast data generation and multistep sampling to improve sample quality. In this paper, we study the convergence of consistency models when the self-consistency property holds approximately under the training distribution. Our analysis requires only mild data assumption and applies to a family of forward processes. When the target data distribution has bounded support or has tails that decay sufficiently fast, we show that the samples generated by the consistency model are close to the target distribution in Wasserstein distance; when the target distribution satisfies some smoothness assumption, we show that with an additional perturbation step for smoothing, the generated samples are close to the target distribution in total variation distance. We provide two case studies with commonly chosen forward processes to demonstrate the benefit of multistep sampling.

<div> Keywords: Transformers, Regression tasks, Noisy data, Manifold, Approximation errors

Summary:
Transformers are foundational for language and video generation models like GPT and BERT. This study explores the performance of transformers for regression tasks with noisy input data on a manifold. The input data are in a tubular neighborhood of the manifold, and the ground truth function depends on the projection of the noisy data onto the manifold. By analyzing approximation and generalization errors, the study establishes that transformers can effectively handle low-dimensional structures in learning tasks even with high-dimensional noise present. The intrinsic dimension of the manifold plays a significant role in the performance of transformers. The study introduces a unique proof technique that constructs representations of basic arithmetic operations by transformers, showcasing their ability to understand and leverage low-complexity structures in learning tasks.

Abstract: Transformers serve as the foundational architecture for large language and video generation models, such as GPT, BERT, SORA and their successors. Empirical studies have demonstrated that real-world data and learning tasks exhibit low-dimensional structures, along with some noise or measurement error. The performance of transformers tends to depend on the intrinsic dimension of the data/tasks, though theoretical understandings remain largely unexplored for transformers. This work establishes a theoretical foundation by analyzing the performance of transformers for regression tasks involving noisy input data on a manifold. Specifically, the input data are in a tubular neighborhood of a manifold, while the ground truth function depends on the projection of the noisy data onto the manifold. We prove approximation and generalization errors which crucially depend on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. Our results demonstrate that transformers can leverage low-complexity structures in learning task even when the input data are perturbed by high-dimensional noise. Our novel proof technique constructs representations of basic arithmetic operations by transformers, which may hold independent interest.

<div> Keywords: Partial Label Learning, Clustering, Weakly Supervised Learning, Disambiguation, Dual-Graph Learning

Summary: 
This paper explores the partial label clustering problem within the context of weakly supervised learning. The approach involves constructing a weight matrix based on example relationships, disambiguating candidate labels to estimate the ground-truth label, and implementing must-link and cannot-link constraints. By propagating these constraints using an adversarial prior promoted dual-graph learning approach, clustering performance is enhanced. The integration of weight matrix construction, label disambiguation, and pairwise constraints propagation in a joint model leads to mutual enhancement. Theoretical proof is provided to support the idea that better disambiguated labels can improve clustering performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to existing constrained clustering methods and show its effectiveness in limited sample annotation scenarios. The code implementation is publicly available for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) is a significant weakly supervised learning framework, where each training example corresponds to a set of candidate labels and only one label is the ground-truth label. For the first time, this paper investigates the partial label clustering problem, which takes advantage of the limited available partial labels to improve the clustering performance. Specifically, we first construct a weight matrix of examples based on their relationships in the feature space and disambiguate the candidate labels to estimate the ground-truth label based on the weight matrix. Then, we construct a set of must-link and cannot-link constraints based on the disambiguation results. Moreover, we propagate the initial must-link and cannot-link constraints based on an adversarial prior promoted dual-graph learning approach. Finally, we integrate weight matrix construction, label disambiguation, and pairwise constraints propagation into a joint model to achieve mutual enhancement. We also theoretically prove that a better disambiguated label matrix can help improve clustering performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method realizes superior performance when comparing with state-of-the-art constrained clustering methods, and outperforms PLL and semi-supervised PLL methods when only limited samples are annotated.

Summary: 
DYSTIL is a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates large language models to improve learning from expert demonstrations. It dynamically queries a language model to induce textual strategies based on advantage estimations and expert demonstrations, enhancing the RL agent's performance, generalization, and sample efficiency. DYSTIL allows for the observation and interpretation of the policy's evolution through textual channels.

arXiv:2505.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from expert demonstrations has long remained a challenging research problem, and existing state-of-the-art methods using behavioral cloning plus further RL training often suffer from poor generalization, low sample efficiency, and poor model interpretability. Inspired by the strong reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose a novel strategy-based reinforcement learning framework integrated with LLMs called DYnamic STrategy Induction with Llms for reinforcement learning (DYSTIL) to overcome these limitations. DYSTIL dynamically queries a strategy-generating LLM to induce textual strategies based on advantage estimations and expert demonstrations, and gradually internalizes induced strategies into the RL agent through policy optimization to improve its performance through boosting policy generalization and enhancing sample efficiency. It also provides a direct textual channel to observe and interpret the evolution of the policy's underlying strategies during training. We test DYSTIL over challenging RL environments from Minigrid and BabyAI, and empirically demonstrate that DYSTIL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods by 17.75% in average success rate while also enjoying higher sample efficiency during the learning process.

Abstract: The integration of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technology in 6G Internet of Things (IoT) networks faces significant challenges in remote areas and disaster scenarios where ground infrastructure is unavailable. This paper proposes a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) system enhanced by directional antennas to provide both computational resources and energy support for ground IoT terminals. However, such systems require multiple trade-off policies to balance UAV energy consumption, terminal battery levels, and computational resource allocation under various constraints, including limited UAV battery capacity, non-linear energy harvesting characteristics, and dynamic task arrivals. To address these challenges comprehensively, we formulate a bi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously considers system energy efficiency and terminal battery sustainability. We then reformulate this non-convex problem with a hybrid solution space as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose an improved soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm with an action simplification mechanism to enhance its convergence and generalization capabilities. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed approach outperforms various baselines in different scenarios, achieving efficient energy management while maintaining high computational performance. Furthermore, our method shows strong generalization ability across different scenarios, particularly in complex environments, validating the effectiveness of our designed boundary penalty and charging reward mechanisms.

<div> problem formulation, sequential decision-making, sensing cost, Markov Decision Process, optimal policy

Summary: 
This article addresses sequential decision-making problems where tracking the environment incurs a cost for sensing. The agent must decide when to sense the state, balancing the value of optimal actions with the cost of sensing. The problem is formulated as an expected discounted cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) with an expanded state space. While computing the optimal policy for this MDP is generally intractable, the article bounds the sub-optimality gap for optimal policies in a restricted class. Additionally, a heuristic algorithm based on policy improvement is proposed, which performs closely to the optimal policy in practice. The article concludes with a numerical case study benchmarking against existing methods. <div>
arXiv:2505.03280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many practical sequential decision-making problems, tracking the state of the environment incurs a sensing/communication/computation cost. In these settings, the agent's interaction with its environment includes the additional component of deciding $\textit{when}$ to sense the state, in a manner that balances the value associated with optimal (state-specific) actions and the cost of sensing. We formulate this as an expected discounted cost Markov Decision Process (MDP), wherein the agent incurs an additional cost for sensing its next state, but has the option to take actions while remaining 'blind' to the system state.
  We pose this problem as a classical discounted cost MDP with an expanded (countably infinite) state space. While computing the optimal policy for this MDP is intractable in general, we bound the sub-optimality gap associated with optimal policies in a restricted class, where the number of consecutive non-sensing (a.k.a., blind) actions is capped. We also design a computationally efficient heuristic algorithm based on policy improvement, which in practice performs close to the optimal policy. Finally, we benchmark against the state of the art via a numerical case study.

Summary:
PETNN is a novel recurrent neural network architecture inspired by physics energy transition models. It is designed to effectively capture long-term dependencies in sequence modeling tasks. Unlike Transformers, PETNN's memory mechanism enables it to store information over extended periods, leading to superior performance in various sequence tasks. The study indicates that PETNN outperforms Transformer-based methods while exhibiting significantly lower complexity due to its recurrent nature. This suggests the potential for developing more efficient recurrent neural networks in domains traditionally dominated by Transformer models. Overall, PETNN showcases the effectiveness of pure RNNs in capturing long-term dependencies and presents a promising alternative to current state-of-the-art sequence modeling techniques.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the superior performance of Transformers has made them a more robust and scalable solution for sequence modeling than traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the effectiveness of Transformer in capturing long-term dependencies is primarily attributed to their comprehensive pair-modeling process rather than inherent inductive biases toward sequence semantics. In this study, we explore the capabilities of pure RNNs and reassess their long-term learning mechanisms. Inspired by the physics energy transition models that track energy changes over time, we propose a effective recurrent structure called the``Physics-inspired Energy Transition Neural Network" (PETNN). We demonstrate that PETNN's memory mechanism effectively stores information over long-term dependencies. Experimental results indicate that PETNN outperforms transformer-based methods across various sequence tasks. Furthermore, owing to its recurrent nature, PETNN exhibits significantly lower complexity. Our study presents an optimal foundational recurrent architecture and highlights the potential for developing effective recurrent neural networks in fields currently dominated by Transformer.

Deep reinforcement learning has shown promise in solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. While policy-based methods are commonly used in this field, this study evaluates the effectiveness of value-based algorithms, such as deep q-network and its extensions, in solving the job-shop and flexible job-shop scheduling problems. The results challenge the belief that policy-based methods are always superior, as value-based approaches can perform equally well or even better. This suggests that value-based strategies should be given more attention in combinatorial optimization research.

arXiv:2505.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. Broadly, deep reinforcement learning methods fall into two categories: policy-based and value-based. While value-based approaches have achieved notable success in domains such as the Arcade Learning Environment, the combinatorial optimization community has predominantly favored policy-based methods, often overlooking the potential of value-based algorithms. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of value-based algorithms, including the deep q-network and several of its advanced extensions, within the context of two complex combinatorial problems: the job-shop and the flexible job-shop scheduling problems, two fundamental challenges with multiple industrial applications. Our results challenge the assumption that policy-based methods are inherently superior for combinatorial optimization. We show that several value-based approaches can match or even outperform the widely adopted proximal policy optimization algorithm, suggesting that value-based strategies deserve greater attention from the combinatorial optimization community.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new paradigm called Absolute Zero for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. In Absolute Zero, a model, Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), autonomously proposes tasks to maximize learning progress without external data reliance. It uses a code executor to validate tasks and verify answers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks. AZR surpasses existing models relying on human-curated examples, demonstrating scalability and adaptability across different model scales. This approach addresses concerns of limited human supervision and potential learning limitations for superintelligent systems, providing a promising framework for open-ended yet grounded learning. <div>
arXiv:2505.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.

This chapter introduces a framework for studying geospatial mechanistic interpretability in Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to understand how these models process geographic information. The use of probing is outlined to reveal internal structures within LLMs, and the concept of mechanistic interpretability is introduced. Sparse autoencoders are discussed as a method to disentangle complex internal representations into more interpretable features. Through experiments using spatial autocorrelation, the study shows how LLMs process geographical information, particularly placenames, by displaying spatial patterns related to geographic locations. The framework provides insights into how LLMs think about geographic information and can shape the study and use of foundation models in geography.<br /><br />Summary: This chapter presents a framework for understanding how Large Language Models process geographical information, utilizing spatial analysis, probing techniques, and sparse autoencoders.

The framework provides valuable insights into the workings of LLMs and can potentially influence the development and application of foundation models in geography. <div>
arXiv:2505.03368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. Their ability to process and generate viable text and code has made them ubiquitous in many fields, while their deployment as knowledge bases and "reasoning" tools remains an area of ongoing research. In geography, a growing body of literature has been focusing on evaluating LLMs' geographical knowledge and their ability to perform spatial reasoning. However, very little is still known about the internal functioning of these models, especially about how they process geographical information.
  In this chapter, we establish a novel framework for the study of geospatial mechanistic interpretability - using spatial analysis to reverse engineer how LLMs handle geographical information. Our aim is to advance our understanding of the internal representations that these complex models generate while processing geographical information - what one might call "how LLMs think about geographic information" if such phrasing was not an undue anthropomorphism.
  We first outline the use of probing in revealing internal structures within LLMs. We then introduce the field of mechanistic interpretability, discussing the superposition hypothesis and the role of sparse autoencoders in disentangling polysemantic internal representations of LLMs into more interpretable, monosemantic features. In our experiments, we use spatial autocorrelation to show how features obtained for placenames display spatial patterns related to their geographic location and can thus be interpreted geospatially, providing insights into how these models process geographical information. We conclude by discussing how our framework can help shape the study and use of foundation models in geography.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces SPAP, a novel structured pruning framework for large language models (LLMs) that addresses the challenges of computational and memory demands. SPAP utilizes a mixed-integer optimization model and a penalty method to minimize pruning errors efficiently. The framework also includes an alternating minimization algorithm tailored to the problem structure for efficient weight updates and performance recovery. Experimental results on various models demonstrate SPAP's superiority over existing methods, providing linear inference speedups and memory reductions proportional to sparsity. The approach offers a practical, optimization-driven solution for pruning LLMs while maintaining model performance. <div>
arXiv:2505.03373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by their substantial computational and memory demands. While structured pruning presents a viable approach by eliminating entire network components, existing methods suffer from performance degradation, reliance on heuristic metrics, or expensive finetuning. To address these challenges, we propose SPAP (Structured Pruning via Alternating Optimization and Penalty Methods), a novel and efficient structured pruning framework for LLMs grounded in optimization theory. SPAP formulates the pruning problem through a mixed-integer optimization model, employs a penalty method that effectively makes pruning decisions to minimize pruning errors, and introduces an alternating minimization algorithm tailored to the splittable problem structure for efficient weight updates and performance recovery. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA-3/3.1/3.2, and Qwen2.5 models demonstrate SPAP's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, delivering linear inference speedups (1.29$\times$ at 30% sparsity) and proportional memory reductions. Our work offers a practical, optimization-driven solution for pruning LLMs while preserving model performance.

This study focuses on using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to infer active contractility parameters in cardiac biomechanical models from medical imaging data. The accurate assessment of active stress parameters is crucial for understanding myocardial function. By parametrising the state and parameter field with neural networks and formulating an energy minimisation problem, the study reconstructs active stress fields with high spatial resolution, even in the presence of noise.

The influence of loss weights on parameter reconstruction is thoroughly analysed. The approach is applied to detecting tissue inhomogeneities and fibrotic scars in myocardial tissue. This innovative method could significantly improve the diagnosis, treatment planning, and management of heart conditions associated with cardiac fibrosis. <br /><br /> Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active stress models in cardiac biomechanics account for the mechanical deformation caused by muscle activity, thus providing a link between the electrophysiological and mechanical properties of the tissue. The accurate assessment of active stress parameters is fundamental for a precise understanding of myocardial function but remains difficult to achieve in a clinical setting, especially when only displacement and strain data from medical imaging modalities are available. This work investigates, through an in-silico study, the application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for inferring active contractility parameters in time-dependent cardiac biomechanical models from these types of imaging data. In particular, by parametrising the sought state and parameter field with two neural networks, respectively, and formulating an energy minimisation problem to search for the optimal network parameters, we are able to reconstruct in various settings active stress fields in the presence of noise and with a high spatial resolution. To this end, we also advance the vanilla PINN learning algorithm with the use of adaptive weighting schemes, ad-hoc regularisation strategies, Fourier features, and suitable network architectures. In addition, we thoroughly analyse the influence of the loss weights in the reconstruction of active stress parameters. Finally, we apply the method to the characterisation of tissue inhomogeneities and detection of fibrotic scars in myocardial tissue. This approach opens a new pathway to significantly improve the diagnosis, treatment planning, and management of heart conditions associated with cardiac fibrosis.

Abstract: Given the increasing complexity of omics datasets, a key challenge is not only improving classification performance but also enhancing the transparency and reliability of model decisions. Effective model performance and feature selection are fundamental for explainability and reliability. In many cases, high dimensional omics datasets suffer from limited number of samples due to clinical constraints, patient conditions, phenotypes rarity and others conditions. Current omics based classification models often suffer from narrow interpretability, making it difficult to discern meaningful insights where trust and reproducibility are critical. This study presents a machine learning based classification framework that integrates feature selection with data augmentation techniques to achieve high standard classification accuracy while ensuring better interpretability. Using the publicly available dataset (E MTAB 8026), we explore a bootstrap analysis in six binary classification scenarios to evaluate the proposed model's behaviour. We show that the proposed pipeline yields cross validated perfomance on small dataset that is conserved when the trained classifier is applied to a larger test set. Our findings emphasize the fundamental balance between accuracy and feature selection, highlighting the positive effect of introducing synthetic data for better generalization, even in scenarios with very limited samples availability.

Summary: Concept Factorization (CF) models have been successful in data clustering, with recent variants incorporating internal geometric structure and graph regularization. However, performance is heavily reliant on initial graph construction. To address this, the Concept Factorization Based on Self-Representation and Adaptive Graph Structure Learning (CFSRAG) Model is proposed. CFSRAG learns data affinity through self-representation and uses this affinity matrix for dynamic graph regularization, facilitating adaptive learning of data's internal geometric structure. The model's update rule, convergence analysis, and experimental results on four real datasets demonstrate its superiority over existing models. <div>

In recent years, many variant models based on CF have achieved great success in clustering by taking into account the internal geometric manifold structure of the dataset and using graph regularization techniques. However, their clustering performance depends greatly on the construction of the initial graph structure. In order to enable adaptive learning of the graph structure of the data, we propose a Concept Factorization Based on Self-Representation and Adaptive Graph Structure Learning (CFSRAG) Model. CFSRAG learns the affinity relationship between data through a self-representation method, and uses the learned affinity matrix to implement dynamic graph regularization constraints, thereby ensuring dynamic learning of the internal geometric structure of the data. Finally, we give the CFSRAG update rule and convergence analysis, and conduct comparative experiments on four real datasets. The results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models.

Summary:
Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have been used to identify if a given text was part of the pre-training data for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods often struggle with misidentifying non-members as members, leading to high false positive rates. The Automatic Calibration Membership Inference Attack (ACMIA) framework addresses this issue by utilizing a tunable temperature to effectively calibrate output probabilities. This framework, inspired by maximum likelihood estimation during LLM pre-training, offers three configurations to cater to different levels of model access and increase the probability gap between members and non-members. Extensive experiments on various open-source LLMs demonstrate that ACMIA outperforms existing approaches across three widely used benchmarks in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. The code for ACMIA is available on Github for further exploration and implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have recently been employed to determine whether a specific text was part of the pre-training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods often misinfer non-members as members, leading to a high false positive rate, or depend on additional reference models for probability calibration, which limits their practicality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel framework called Automatic Calibration Membership Inference Attack (ACMIA), which utilizes a tunable temperature to calibrate output probabilities effectively. This approach is inspired by our theoretical insights into maximum likelihood estimation during the pre-training of LLMs. We introduce ACMIA in three configurations designed to accommodate different levels of model access and increase the probability gap between members and non-members, improving the reliability and robustness of membership inference. Extensive experiments on various open-source LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attack is highly effective, robust, and generalizable, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines across three widely used benchmarks.

Summary:
The article introduces missingness-avoiding (MA) machine learning, a framework designed to handle missing values at test time without compromising accuracy or interpretability. Traditional approaches often introduce bias or complexity through imputation or missingness indicators. The proposed MA learning algorithms for decision trees, tree ensembles, and sparse linear models include classifier-specific regularization terms in their objectives, enabling them to reduce reliance on missing values based on observed context. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that MA-DT, MA-LASSO, MA-RF, and MA-GBT effectively minimize the need for features with missing values while maintaining competitive predictive performance. This framework provides practitioners with a powerful tool to ensure interpretability in predictions even with test-time missing values.

Abstract: Handling missing values at test time is challenging for machine learning models, especially when aiming for both high accuracy and interpretability. Established approaches often add bias through imputation or excessive model complexity via missingness indicators. Moreover, either method can obscure interpretability, making it harder to understand how the model utilizes the observed variables in predictions. We propose missingness-avoiding (MA) machine learning, a general framework for training models to rarely require the values of missing (or imputed) features at test time. We create tailored MA learning algorithms for decision trees, tree ensembles, and sparse linear models by incorporating classifier-specific regularization terms in their learning objectives. The tree-based models leverage contextual missingness by reducing reliance on missing values based on the observed context. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MA-DT, MA-LASSO, MA-RF, and MA-GBT effectively reduce the reliance on features with missing values while maintaining predictive performance competitive with their unregularized counterparts. This shows that our framework gives practitioners a powerful tool to maintain interpretability in predictions with test-time missing values.

Summary:<br />
Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) utilize diffusion processes to model complex data distributions by perturbing them with Gaussian noise and then denoising the output. This method has shown superior performance across various domains but existing convergence analysis relies on strong regularity assumptions. This study introduces non-asymptotic Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees for SGMs targeting semiconvex distributions with potentially discontinuous gradients. The bounds are explicit and achieve optimal dependence on data dimension and convergence rate. This framework accommodates a broad range of distributions such as Gaussian mixtures and double-well potentials. By leveraging semiconvexity without requiring smoothness assumptions, this research expands the theoretical understanding of SGMs, bridging the gap between empirical success and rigorous guarantees in non-smooth, complex data scenarios.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) approximate a data distribution by perturbing it with Gaussian noise and subsequently denoising it via a learned reverse diffusion process. These models excel at modeling complex data distributions and generating diverse samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance across domains such as computer vision, audio generation, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. Despite their empirical success, existing Wasserstein-2 convergence analysis typically assume strong regularity conditions-such as smoothness or strict log-concavity of the data distribution-that are rarely satisfied in practice. In this work, we establish the first non-asymptotic Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees for SGMs targeting semiconvex distributions with potentially discontinuous gradients. Our upper bounds are explicit and sharp in key parameters, achieving optimal dependence of $O(\sqrt{d})$ on the data dimension $d$ and convergence rate of order one. The framework accommodates a wide class of practically relevant distributions, including symmetric modified half-normal distributions, Gaussian mixtures, double-well potentials, and elastic net potentials. By leveraging semiconvexity without requiring smoothness assumptions on the potential such as differentiability, our results substantially broaden the theoretical foundations of SGMs, bridging the gap between empirical success and rigorous guarantees in non-smooth, complex data regimes.

Abstract: Generative models can unintentionally memorize training data, posing significant privacy risks. This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.

5. AnomalyMatch is tailored for large-scale applications and can process predictions for millions of images efficiently, making it suitable for discovering scientifically valuable anomalies in vast astronomical datasets.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.03509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in large datasets is essential in fields such as astronomy and computer vision; however, supervised methods typically require extensive anomaly labelling, which is often impractical. We present AnomalyMatch, an anomaly detection framework combining the semi-supervised FixMatch algorithm using EfficientNet classifiers with active learning. By treating anomaly detection as a semi-supervised binary classification problem, we efficiently utilise limited labelled and abundant unlabelled images. We allow iterative model refinement in a user interface for expert verification of high-confidence anomalies and correction of false positives. Built for astronomical data, AnomalyMatch generalises readily to other domains facing similar data challenges. Evaluations on the GalaxyMNIST astronomical dataset and the miniImageNet natural-image benchmark under severe class imbalance (1% anomalies for miniImageNet) display strong performance: starting from five to ten labelled anomalies and after three active learning cycles, we achieve an average AUROC of 0.95 (miniImageNet) and 0.86 (GalaxyMNIST), with respective AUPRC of 0.77 and 0.71. After active learning cycles, anomalies are ranked with 71% (miniImageNet) to 93% precision in the 1% of the highest-ranked images. AnomalyMatch is tailored for large-scale applications, efficiently processing predictions for 100 million images within three days on a single GPU. Integrated into ESAs Datalabs platform, AnomalyMatch facilitates targeted discovery of scientifically valuable anomalies in vast astronomical datasets. Our results underscore the exceptional utility and scalability of this approach for anomaly discovery, highlighting the value of specialised approaches for domains characterised by severe label scarcity.

Summary: This paper presents an in-depth study on the evaluation of Model Inversion (MI) attacks. Firstly, a comprehensive human-annotated dataset of MI attack samples is constructed, revealing false positives in the commonly used evaluation framework. The accuracy of MI attacks may have been overestimated due to this issue. The study uncovers the impact of Type I adversarial features on MI evaluation and suggests a relationship with adversarial transferability. The findings indicate that the actual privacy leakage in SOTA MI attacks is lower than previously reported. The paper highlights limitations in the current evaluation framework and proposes methods to mitigate false positive rates. It suggests considering human evaluation as a primary framework and encourages the development of more robust automatic evaluation methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks aim to reconstruct information of private training data by exploiting access to machine learning models. The most common evaluation framework for MI attacks/defenses relies on an evaluation model that has been utilized to assess progress across almost all MI attacks and defenses proposed in recent years. In this paper, for the first time, we present an in-depth study of MI evaluation. Firstly, we construct the first comprehensive human-annotated dataset of MI attack samples, based on 28 setups of different MI attacks, defenses, private and public datasets. Secondly, using our dataset, we examine the accuracy of the MI evaluation framework and reveal that it suffers from a significant number of false positives. These findings raise questions about the previously reported success rates of SOTA MI attacks. Thirdly, we analyze the causes of these false positives, design controlled experiments, and discover the surprising effect of Type I adversarial features on MI evaluation, as well as adversarial transferability, highlighting a relationship between two previously distinct research areas. Our findings suggest that the performance of SOTA MI attacks has been overestimated, with the actual privacy leakage being significantly less than previously reported. In conclusion, we highlight critical limitations in the widely used MI evaluation framework and present our methods to mitigate false positive rates. We remark that prior research has shown that Type I adversarial attacks are very challenging, with no existing solution. Therefore, we urge to consider human evaluation as a primary MI evaluation framework rather than merely a supplement as in previous MI research. We also encourage further work on developing more robust and reliable automatic evaluation frameworks.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a causal intervention framework for enhancing the interpretability of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), focusing on understanding how semantic factors are processed within the network. The framework includes interventions such as input manipulations, latent space perturbations, activation patching, and causal mediation analysis to analyze "circuit motifs" in VAEs. By applying the framework to synthetic datasets and disentanglement benchmarks, the study demonstrates the ability to identify functional circuits, map computational graphs to causal graphs, and differentiate between polysemantic and monosemantic units. Metrics like causal effect strength, intervention specificity, and circuit modularity are introduced to quantify the interpretability of VAE components. Experimental results highlight the differences in interpretability between VAE variants, with FactorVAE showing higher disentanglement scores and effect strengths compared to standard VAE and Beta-VAE. Overall, this framework enhances the mechanistic understanding of generative models like VAEs and offers tools for designing more transparent and controllable architectures.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability of deep learning models has emerged as a crucial research direction for understanding the functioning of neural networks. While significant progress has been made in interpreting discriminative models like transformers, understanding generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remains challenging. This paper introduces a comprehensive causal intervention framework for mechanistic interpretability of VAEs. We develop techniques to identify and analyze "circuit motifs" in VAEs, examining how semantic factors are encoded, processed, and disentangled through the network layers. Our approach uses targeted interventions at different levels: input manipulations, latent space perturbations, activation patching, and causal mediation analysis. We apply our framework to both synthetic datasets with known causal relationships and standard disentanglement benchmarks. Results show that our interventions can successfully isolate functional circuits, map computational graphs to causal graphs of semantic factors, and distinguish between polysemantic and monosemantic units. Furthermore, we introduce metrics for causal effect strength, intervention specificity, and circuit modularity that quantify the interpretability of VAE components. Experimental results demonstrate clear differences between VAE variants, with FactorVAE achieving higher disentanglement scores (0.084) and effect strengths (mean 4.59) compared to standard VAE (0.064, 3.99) and Beta-VAE (0.051, 3.43). Our framework advances the mechanistic understanding of generative models and provides tools for more transparent and controllable VAE architectures.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel resource allocation strategy for federated learning in wireless networks that considers rapid channel fluctuations. Using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, the proposed strategy addresses system and statistical heterogeneity by formulating the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and solving it with the QMIX algorithm. Clients act as agents making local decisions based on observations and rewards from convergence analysis within each coherence time slot. The MARL approach simplifies decision-making while improving scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the QMIX-based strategy over baseline methods, particularly in heterogeneous environments. Ablation studies emphasize the significance of considering small-scale fading dynamics for optimizing federated learning performance.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Judicious resource allocation can effectively enhance federated learning (FL) training performance in wireless networks by addressing both system and statistical heterogeneity. However, existing strategies typically rely on block fading assumptions, which overlooks rapid channel fluctuations within each round of FL gradient uploading, leading to a degradation in FL training performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a small-scale-fading-aware resource allocation strategy using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Specifically, we establish a one-step convergence bound of the FL algorithm and formulate the resource allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which is subsequently solved using the QMIX algorithm. In our framework, each client serves as an agent that dynamically determines spectrum and power allocations within each coherence time slot, based on local observations and a reward derived from the convergence analysis. The MARL setting reduces the dimensionality of the action space and facilitates decentralized decision-making, enhancing the scalability and practicality of the solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our QMIX-based resource allocation strategy significantly outperforms baseline methods across various degrees of statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, ablation studies validate the critical importance of incorporating small-scale fading dynamics, highlighting its role in optimizing FL performance.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a innovative approach for training Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs (PeNODEs) by formulating the training process as a dynamic optimization problem. The model, involving neural components, is discretized using a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta method with flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, leading to a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) which can be efficiently solved using state-of-the-art NLP solvers like Ipopt. This approach allows for simultaneous optimization of network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key challenges of ODE solver-based training such as stability, runtime, and accuracy. The paper extends a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, generalizes to PeNODEs, includes physical constraints, and offers a custom, parallelized, open-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a Van-der-Pol oscillator indicate better accuracy, speed, and generalization with smaller networks in comparison to other training methods. Additionally, the integration of this approach into OpenModelica is planned to facilitate accessible training of Neural DAEs. <div>

Summary: 
Coverage Path Planning of Thermal Interface Materials (TIM) is important in power electronics and electronic control unit design. Traditionally done manually or via optimization approaches, a new AI-based method proposes using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to generate dispense paths for TIM applications. The ANN takes the target cooling area as input and outputs the dispense path, eliminating the need for labels and reducing computational effort. The resulting paths can be transferred directly to manufacturing equipment without air entrapments. This approach could potentially be applied to other manufacturing processes, offering real-time prediction of process parameters for desired target states. <div>

Abstract: Coverage Path Planning of Thermal Interface Materials (TIM) plays a crucial role in the design of power electronics and electronic control units. Up to now, this is done manually by experts or by using optimization approaches with a high computational effort. We propose a novel AI-based approach to generate dispense paths for TIM and similar dispensing applications. It is a drop-in replacement for optimization-based approaches. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) receives the target cooling area as input and directly outputs the dispense path. Our proposed setup does not require labels and we show its feasibility on multiple target areas. The resulting dispense paths can be directly transferred to automated manufacturing equipment and do not exhibit air entrapments. The approach of using an ANN to predict process parameters for a desired target state in real-time could potentially be transferred to other manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) were initially introduced on directed acyclic graphs to sample from an unnormalized distribution density. Recent works have extended the theoretical framework for generative methods allowing more flexibility and enhancing application range. However, many challenges remain in training GFNs in continuous settings and for imitation learning (IL), including intractability of flow-matching loss, limited tests of non-acyclic training, and the need for a separate reward model in imitation learning. The present work proposes a family of generative flows called Ergodic Generative Flows (EGFs) which are used to address the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage ergodicity to build simple generative flows with finitely many globally defined transformations (diffeomorphisms) with universality guarantees and tractable flow-matching loss (FM loss). Second, we introduce a new loss involving cross-entropy coupled to weak flow-matching control, coined KL-weakFM loss. It is designed for IL training without a separate reward model. We evaluate IL-EGFs on toy 2D tasks and real-world datasets from NASA on the sphere, using the KL-weakFM loss. Additionally, we conduct toy 2D reinforcement learning experiments with a target reward, using the FM loss.

<title>Anant-Net: Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality with Scalable and Interpretable Neural Surrogate for High-Dimensional PDEs</title>

Abstract: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) arise in diverse scientific and engineering applications but remain computationally intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. Traditional numerical methods struggle with the exponential growth in computational complexity, particularly on hypercubic domains, where the number of required collocation points increases rapidly with dimensionality. Here, we introduce Anant-Net, an efficient neural surrogate that overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high dimensions. Unlike hyperspheres, where the internal volume diminishes as dimensionality increases, hypercubes retain or expand their volume (for unit or larger length), making high-dimensional computations significantly more demanding. Anant-Net efficiently incorporates high-dimensional boundary conditions and minimizes the PDE residual at high-dimensional collocation points. To enhance interpretability, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold networks into the Anant-Net architecture. We benchmark Anant-Net's performance on several linear and nonlinear high-dimensional equations, including the Poisson, Sine-Gordon, and Allen-Cahn equations, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness across randomly sampled test points from high-dimensional space. Importantly, Anant-Net achieves these results with remarkable efficiency, solving 300-dimensional problems on a single GPU within a few hours. We also compare Anant-Net's results for accuracy and runtime with other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings establish Anant-Net as an accurate, interpretable, and scalable framework for efficiently solving high-dimensional PDEs.

<title>Understand the Effect of Importance Weighting in Deep Learning on Dataset Shift</title>

Abstract: We evaluate the effectiveness of importance weighting in deep neural networks under label shift and covariate shift. On synthetic 2D data (linearly separable and moon-shaped) using logistic regression and MLPs, we observe that weighting strongly affects decision boundaries early in training but fades with prolonged optimization. On CIFAR-10 with various class imbalances, only L2 regularization (not dropout) helps preserve weighting effects. In a covariate-shift experiment, importance weighting yields no significant performance gain, highlighting challenges on complex data. Our results call into question the practical utility of importance weighting for real-world distribution shifts.

<title>ALMA: Aggregated Lipschitz Maximization Attack on Auto-encoders</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03646</link>

arXiv:2505.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the extensive use of deep autoencoders (AEs) in critical applications, their adversarial robustness remains relatively underexplored compared to classification models. AE robustness is characterized by the Lipschitz bounds of its components. Existing robustness evaluation frameworks based on white-box attacks do not fully exploit the vulnerabilities of intermediate ill-conditioned layers in AEs. In the context of optimizing imperceptible norm-bounded additive perturbations to maximize output damage, existing methods struggle to effectively propagate adversarial loss gradients throughout the network, often converging to less effective perturbations. To address this, we propose a novel layer-conditioning-based adversarial optimization objective that effectively guides the adversarial map toward regions of local Lipschitz bounds by enhancing loss gradient information propagation during attack optimization. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art AEs that our adversarial objective results in stronger attacks, outperforming existing methods in both universal and sample-specific scenarios. As a defense method against this attack, we introduce an inference-time adversarially trained defense plugin that mitigates the effects of adversarial examples.

<title>Mitigating mode collapse in normalizing flows by annealing with an adaptive schedule: Application to parameter estimation</title>

arXiv:2505.03652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalizing flows (NFs) provide uncorrelated samples from complex distributions, making them an appealing tool for parameter estimation. However, the practical utility of NFs remains limited by their tendency to collapse to a single mode of a multimodal distribution. In this study, we show that annealing with an adaptive schedule based on the effective sample size (ESS) can mitigate mode collapse. We demonstrate that our approach can converge the marginal likelihood for a biochemical oscillator model fit to time-series data in ten-fold less computation time than a widely used ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We show that the ESS can also be used to reduce variance by pruning the samples. We expect these developments to be of general use for sampling with NFs and discuss potential opportunities for further improvements.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown high performance on spectroscopic inverse problems when sufficient data is available. However, it is often the case that data in spectroscopy is scarce, and this usually causes severe overfitting problems with deep learning methods. Traditional machine learning methods are viable when datasets are smaller, but the accuracy and applicability of these methods is generally more limited.
  We introduce a deep learning method for classification of molecular spectra based on learning integral operators via integral equations of the first kind, which results in an algorithm that is less affected by overfitting issues on small datasets, compared to other deep learning models.
  The problem formulation of the deep learning approach is based on inverse problems, which have traditionally found important applications in spectroscopy. We perform experiments on real world data to showcase our algorithm. It is seen that the model outperforms traditional machine learning approaches such as decision tree and support vector machine, and for small datasets it outperforms other deep learning models. Therefore, our methodology leverages the power of deep learning, still maintaining the performance when the available data is very limited, which is one of the main issues that deep learning faces in spectroscopy, where datasets are often times of small size.

<title>Learning Survival Distributions with the Asymmetric Laplace Distribution</title>

Abstract: Probabilistic survival analysis models seek to estimate the distribution of the future occurrence (time) of an event given a set of covariates. In recent years, these models have preferred nonparametric specifications that avoid directly estimating survival distributions via discretization. Specifically, they estimate the probability of an individual event at fixed times or the time of an event at fixed probabilities (quantiles), using supervised learning. Borrowing ideas from the quantile regression literature, we propose a parametric survival analysis method based on the Asymmetric Laplace Distribution (ALD). This distribution allows for closed-form calculation of popular event summaries such as mean, median, mode, variation, and quantiles. The model is optimized by maximum likelihood to learn, at the individual level, the parameters (location, scale, and asymmetry) of the ALD distribution. Extensive results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms parametric and nonparametric approaches in terms of accuracy, discrimination and calibration.

Abstract: Solar sensor-based monitoring systems have become a crucial agricultural innovation, advancing farm management and animal welfare through integrating sensor technology, Internet-of-Things, and edge and cloud computing. However, the resilience of these systems to cyber-attacks and their adaptability to dynamic and constrained energy supplies remain largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a sustainable smart farm network designed to maintain high-quality animal monitoring under various cyber and adversarial threats, as well as fluctuating energy conditions. Our approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to devise optimal policies that maximize both monitoring effectiveness and energy efficiency. To overcome DRL's inherent challenge of slow convergence, we integrate transfer learning (TL) and decision theory (DT) to accelerate the learning process. By incorporating DT-guided strategies, we optimize monitoring quality and energy sustainability, significantly reducing training time while achieving comparable performance rewards. Our experimental results prove that DT-guided DRL outperforms TL-enhanced DRL models, improving system performance and reducing training runtime by 47.5%.

<title>Feature Staleness Aware Incremental Learning for CTR Prediction</title>

Abstract: Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction in real-world recommender systems often deals with billions of user interactions every day. To improve the training efficiency, it is common to update the CTR prediction model incrementally using the new incremental data and a subset of historical data. However, the feature embeddings of a CTR prediction model often get stale when the corresponding features do not appear in current incremental data. In the next period, the model would have a performance degradation on samples containing stale features, which we call the feature staleness problem. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Feature Staleness Aware Incremental Learning method for CTR prediction (FeSAIL) which adaptively replays samples containing stale features. We first introduce a staleness aware sampling algorithm (SAS) to sample a fixed number of stale samples with high sampling efficiency. We then introduce a staleness aware regularization mechanism (SAR) for a fine-grained control of the feature embedding updating. We instantiate FeSAIL with a general deep learning-based CTR prediction model and the experimental results demonstrate FeSAIL outperforms various state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Target-specific peptides, such as conotoxins, exhibit exceptional binding affinity and selectivity toward ion channels and receptors. However, their therapeutic potential remains underutilized due to the limited diversity of natural variants and the labor-intensive nature of traditional optimization strategies. Here, we present CreoPep, a deep learning-based conditional generative framework that integrates masked language modeling with a progressive masking scheme to design high-affinity peptide mutants while uncovering novel structural motifs. CreoPep employs an integrative augmentation pipeline, combining FoldX-based energy screening with temperature-controlled multinomial sampling, to generate structurally and functionally diverse peptides that retain key pharmacological properties. We validate this approach by designing conotoxin inhibitors targeting the $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, achieving submicromolar potency in electrophysiological assays. Structural analysis reveals that CreoPep-generated variants engage in both conserved and novel binding modes, including disulfide-deficient forms, thus expanding beyond conventional design paradigms. Overall, CreoPep offers a robust and generalizable platform that bridges computational peptide design with experimental validation, accelerating the discovery of next-generation peptide therapeutics.

<title>The Art of Repair: Optimizing Iterative Program Repair with Instruction-Tuned Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02931</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic program repair (APR) aims to reduce the manual efforts required to identify and fix errors in source code. Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a common strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to the thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently, self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and disregards different numbers of outputs.
  We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing a limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs - DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR task. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K, 30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess their repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.
  Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning dataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible patches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using Full Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather than generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative strategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned models, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages, particularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for balanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.

<title>Single-Sample and Robust Online Resource Allocation</title>

Abstract: Online Resource Allocation problem is a central problem in many areas of Computer Science, Operations Research, and Economics. In this problem, we sequentially receive $n$ stochastic requests for $m$ kinds of shared resources, where each request can be satisfied in multiple ways, consuming different amounts of resources and generating different values. The goal is to achieve a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation to the hindsight optimum, where $\epsilon>0$ is a small constant, assuming each resource has a large budget.
  In this paper, we investigate the learnability and robustness of online resource allocation. Our primary contribution is a novel Exponential Pricing algorithm with the following properties: 1. It requires only a \emph{single sample} from each of the $n$ request distributions to achieve a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation for online resource allocation with large budgets. Such an algorithm was previously unknown, even with access to polynomially many samples, as prior work either assumed full distributional knowledge or was limited to i.i.d.\,or random-order arrivals. 2. It is robust to corruptions in the outliers model and the value augmentation model. Specifically, it maintains its $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation guarantee under both these robustness models, resolving the open question posed in Argue, Gupta, Molinaro, and Singla (SODA'22). 3. It operates as a simple item-pricing algorithm that ensures incentive compatibility.
  The intuition behind our Exponential Pricing algorithm is that the price of a resource should adjust exponentially as it is overused or underused. It differs from conventional approaches that use an online learning algorithm for item pricing. This departure guarantees that the algorithm will never run out of any resource, but loses the usual no-regret properties of online learning algorithms, necessitating a new analytical approach.

arXiv:2505.02972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) seeks to boost statistical power and learning efficiency by discovering structure shared across related tasks. State-of-the-art MTL representation methods, however, usually treat the latent representation matrix as a point in ordinary Euclidean space, ignoring its often non-Euclidean geometry, thus sacrificing robustness when tasks are heterogeneous or even adversarial. We propose GeoERM, a geometry-aware MTL framework that embeds the shared representation on its natural Riemannian manifold and optimizes it via explicit manifold operations. Each training cycle performs (i) a Riemannian gradient step that respects the intrinsic curvature of the search space, followed by (ii) an efficient polar retraction to remain on the manifold, guaranteeing geometric fidelity at every iteration. The procedure applies to a broad class of matrix-factorized MTL models and retains the same per-iteration cost as Euclidean baselines. Across a set of synthetic experiments with task heterogeneity and on a wearable-sensor activity-recognition benchmark, GeoERM consistently improves estimation accuracy, reduces negative transfer, and remains stable under adversarial label noise, outperforming leading MTL and single-task alternatives.

Abstract: The Neural Networks for Partial Differential Equations (NN4PDEs) approach is used to determine the parameters of a simple land-surface model using PyTorch's backpropagation engine. In order to test the inverse model, a synthetic dataset is created by running the model in forward mode with known parameter values to create soil temperature time series that can be used as observations for the inverse model. We show that it is not possible to obtain a reliable parameter estimation using a single observed soil temperature time series. Using measurements at two depths, reliable parameter estimates can be obtained although it is not possible to differentiate between latent and sensible heat fluxes. We apply the inverse model to urban flux tower data in Phoenix, United States, and show that the thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and the combined sensible-latent heat transfer coefficient can be reliably estimated using an observed value for the effective surface albedo. The resulting model accurately predicts the outgoing longwave radiation, conductive soil fluxes and the combined sensible-latent heat fluxes.

Abstract: We introduce some new affine invariant ensemble samplers that are easy to construct and improve upon existing widely used algorithms, especially for high-dimensional problems. Specifically, we propose a derivative-free ensemble side move sampler that performs favorably compared to popular samplers in the \texttt{emcee} package. Additionally, we develop a class of derivative-based ensemble Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers with affine invariance, which outperform standard HMC without affine invariance when sampling highly skewed distributions. We provide asymptotic scaling analysis for high-dimensional Gaussian targets to further elucidate the properties of these affine invariant ensemble samplers. In particular, with derivative information, the affine invariant ensemble HMC can scale much better with dimension compared to derivative-free ensemble samplers.

Abstract: We present Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale (RADLADS), a protocol for rapidly converting softmax attention transformers into linear attention decoder models, along with two new RWKV-variant architectures, and models converted from popular Qwen2.5 open source models in 7B, 32B, and 72B sizes. Our conversion process requires only 350-700M tokens, less than 0.005% of the token count used to train the original teacher models. Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size. We release all our models on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license, with the exception of our 72B models which are also governed by the Qwen License Agreement.

Abstract: Data derived from remote sensing or numerical simulations often have a regular gridded structure and are large in volume, making it challenging to find accurate spatial models that can fill in missing grid cells or simulate the process effectively, especially in the presence of spatial heterogeneity and heavy-tailed marginal distributions. To overcome this issue, we present a spatial autoregressive modeling framework, which maps observations at a location and its neighbors to independent random variables. This is a highly flexible modeling approach and well-suited for non-Gaussian fields, providing simpler interpretability. In particular, we consider the SAR model with Generalized Extreme Value distribution innovations to combine the observation at a central grid location with its neighbors, capturing extreme spatial behavior based on the heavy-tailed innovations. While these models are fast to simulate by exploiting the sparsity of the key matrices in the computations, the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is prohibitive due to the intractability of the likelihood, making optimization challenging. To overcome this, we train a convolutional neural network on a large training set that covers a useful parameter space, and then use the trained network for fast parameter estimation. Finally, we apply this model to analyze annual maximum precipitation data from ERA-Interim-driven Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations, allowing us to explore its spatial extreme behavior across North America.

Abstract: Language model developers typically filter out high-risk content -- such as toxic or copyrighted text -- from their pre-training data to prevent models from generating similar outputs. However, removing such data altogether limits models' ability to recognize and appropriately respond to harmful or sensitive content. In this paper, we introduce Selective Loss to Understand but Not Generate (SLUNG), a pre-training paradigm through which models learn to understand high-risk data without learning to generate it. Instead of uniformly applying the next-token prediction loss, SLUNG selectively avoids incentivizing the generation of high-risk tokens while ensuring they remain within the model's context window. As the model learns to predict low-risk tokens that follow high-risk ones, it is forced to understand the high-risk content. Through our experiments, we show that SLUNG consistently improves models' understanding of high-risk data (e.g., ability to recognize toxic content) without increasing its generation (e.g., toxicity of model responses). Overall, our SLUNG paradigm enables models to benefit from high-risk text that would otherwise be filtered out.

Abstract: We study the invertibility of nonlinear dynamical systems from the perspective of contraction and incremental stability analysis and propose a new invertible recurrent neural model: the BiLipREN. In particular, we consider a nonlinear state space model to be robustly invertible if an inverse exists with a state space realisation, and both the forward model and its inverse are contracting, i.e. incrementally exponentially stable, and Lipschitz, i.e. have bounded incremental gain. This property of bi-Lipschitzness implies both robustness in the sense of sensitivity to input perturbations, as well as robust distinguishability of different inputs from their corresponding outputs, i.e. the inverse model robustly reconstructs the input sequence despite small perturbations to the initial conditions and measured output. Building on this foundation, we propose a parameterization of neural dynamic models: bi-Lipschitz recurrent equilibrium networks (biLipREN), which are robustly invertible by construction. Moreover, biLipRENs can be composed with orthogonal linear systems to construct more general bi-Lipschitz dynamic models, e.g., a nonlinear analogue of minimum-phase/all-pass (inner/outer) factorization. We illustrate the utility of our proposed approach with numerical examples.

Our method addresses key challenges in visuomotor policy learning through a principled variational replanning framework that maintains temporal consistency while efficiently adapting to environmental changes. LAP employs Bayesian updating in latent space to incrementally refine plans as new observations become available, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and real-time adaptability. We bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots through model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate kinematic-dynamic joint states and object positions from human demonstrations. Experimental evaluations across multiple complex manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that LAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in success rate, trajectory smoothness, and energy efficiency, particularly in dynamic adaptation scenarios. Our approach enables robots to perform complex interactions with human-like adaptability while providing an expandable framework applicable to diverse robotic platforms using the same human demonstration videos.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. It is crucial for an IDS to learn to recognize adversarial examples before malicious entities exploit them. In this paper, we generated adversarial samples using the Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA). We validate the generalization and scalability of the adversarial samples to tackle a broad range of real attacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICS). We evaluated the impact by assessing multiple attacks generated using the proposed method. The model trained with adversarial samples detected attacks with 95% accuracy on real-world attack data not used during training. The study was conducted using an operational secure water treatment (SWaT) testbed.

Abstract: Visual defect detection in industrial glass manufacturing remains a critical challenge due to the low frequency of defective products, leading to imbalanced datasets that limit the performance of deep learning models and computer vision systems. This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from 78 percent to 93 percent when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning for spin and molecular systems faces critical challenges of scarce labeled data and computationally expensive simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.

Abstract: This paper presents a Long Short-Term Memory network-based Fluid Experiment Data-Driven model (FED-LSTM) for predicting unsteady, nonlinear hydrodynamic forces on the underwater quadruped robot we constructed. Trained on experimental data from leg force and body drag tests conducted in both a recirculating water tank and a towing tank, FED-LSTM outperforms traditional Empirical Formulas (EF) commonly used for flow prediction over flat surfaces. The model demonstrates superior accuracy and adaptability in capturing complex fluid dynamics, particularly in straight-line and turning-gait optimizations via the NSGA-II algorithm. FED-LSTM reduces deflection errors during straight-line swimming and improves turn times without increasing the turning radius. Hardware experiments further validate the model's precision and stability over EF. This approach provides a robust framework for enhancing the swimming performance of legged robots, laying the groundwork for future advances in underwater robotic locomotion.

Abstract: PID controllers are widely used in control systems because of their simplicity and effectiveness. Although advanced optimization techniques such as Bayesian Optimization and Differential Evolution have been applied to address the challenges of automatic tuning of PID controllers, the influence of initial system states on convergence and the balance between exploration and exploitation remains underexplored. Moreover, experimenting the influence directly on real cyber-physical systems such as mobile robots is crucial for deriving realistic insights. In the present paper, a novel framework is introduced to evaluate the impact of systematically varying these factors on the PID auto-tuning processes that utilize Bayesian Optimization and Differential Evolution. Testing was conducted on two distinct PID-controlled robotic platforms, an omnidirectional robot and a differential drive mobile robot, to assess the effects on convergence rate, settling time, rise time, and overshoot percentage. As a result, the experimental outcomes yield evidence on the effects of the systematic variations, thereby providing an empirical basis for future research studies in the field.

Abstract: Instruction-Action (IA) data pairs are valuable for training robotic systems, especially autonomous vehicles (AVs), but having humans manually annotate this data is costly and time-inefficient. This paper explores the potential of using mobile application Global Positioning System (GPS) references and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate large volumes of IA commands and responses without having a human generate or retroactively tag the data. In our pilot data collection, by driving to various destinations and collecting voice instructions from GPS applications, we demonstrate a means to collect and categorize the diverse sets of instructions, further accompanied by video data to form complete vision-language-action triads. We provide details on our completely automated data collection prototype system, ADVLAT-Engine. We characterize collected GPS voice instructions into eight different classifications, highlighting the breadth of commands and referentialities available for curation from freely available mobile applications. Through research and exploration into the automation of IA data pairs using GPS references, the potential to increase the speed and volume at which high-quality IA datasets are created, while minimizing cost, can pave the way for robust vision-language-action (VLA) models to serve tasks in vision-language navigation (VLN) and human-interactive autonomous systems.

arXiv:2505.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current self-supervised algorithms mostly rely on transformations such as data augmentation and masking to learn visual representations. This is achieved by inducing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations after encoding two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm can limit the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between invariance-related tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we introduce \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling paradigm based on joint-embedding predictive architecture that leverages architectural inductive biases to resolve this trade-off. Without requiring an additional equivariance predictor or loss term, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally segregated representations: one equivariant to the specified transformations and another invariant to them and suited for tasks such as classification. To do so, our model processes a short sequence of different views (observations) of an input image. Each encoded view is concatenated with embeddings corresponding to the relative transformation (action) producing the next observation in the sequence. A transformer encoder outputs an aggregate representation of this sequence, which is subsequently conditioned on the action leading to the next observation to predict its representation. Empirically, seq-JEPA achieves strong performance on equivariant benchmarks and image classification without sacrificing one for the other. Additionally, our framework excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.

Abstract: Bioprocess mechanistic modeling is essential for advancing intelligent digital twin representation of biomanufacturing, yet challenges persist due to complex intracellular regulation, stochastic system behavior, and limited experimental data. This paper introduces a symbolic and statistical learning framework to identify key regulatory mechanisms and quantify model uncertainty. Bioprocess dynamics is formulated with stochastic differential equations characterizing intrinsic process variability, with a predefined set of candidate regulatory mechanisms constructed from biological knowledge. A Bayesian learning approach is developed, which is based on a joint learning of kinetic parameters and regulatory structure through a formulation of the mixture model. To enhance computational efficiency, a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm with adjoint sensitivity analysis is developed for posterior exploration. Compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian inference approaches, the proposed framework achieves improved sample efficiency and robust model selection. An empirical study demonstrates its ability to recover missing regulatory mechanisms and improve model fidelity under data-limited conditions.

Abstract: In explainable AI, Integrated Gradients (IG) is a widely adopted technique for assessing the significance of feature attributes of the input on model outputs by evaluating contributions from a baseline input to the current input. The choice of the baseline input significantly influences the resulting explanation. While the traditional Expected Gradients (EG) method assumes baselines can be uniformly sampled and averaged with equal weights, this study argues that baselines should not be treated equivalently. We introduce Weighted Average Gradients (WG), a novel approach that unsupervisedly evaluates baseline suitability and incorporates a strategy for selecting effective baselines. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that WG satisfies essential explanation method criteria and offers greater stability than prior approaches. Experimental results further confirm that WG outperforms EG across diverse scenarios, achieving an improvement of 10-35\% on main metrics. Moreover, by evaluating baselines, our method can filter a subset of effective baselines for each input to calculate explanations, maintaining high accuracy while reducing computational cost. The code is available at: https://github.com/Tamnt240904/weighted_baseline.

<title>Lower Bounds for Greedy Teaching Set Constructions</title>

Abstract: A fundamental open problem in learning theory is to characterize the best-case teaching dimension $\operatorname{TS}_{\min}$ of a concept class $\mathcal{C}$ with finite VC dimension $d$. Resolving this problem will, in particular, settle the conjectured upper bound on Recursive Teaching Dimension posed by [Simon and Zilles; COLT 2015]. Prior work used a natural greedy algorithm to construct teaching sets recursively, thereby proving upper bounds on $\operatorname{TS}_{\min}$, with the best known bound being $O(d^2)$ [Hu, Wu, Li, and Wang; COLT 2017]. In each iteration, this greedy algorithm chooses to add to the teaching set the $k$ labeled points that restrict the concept class the most. In this work, we prove lower bounds on the performance of this greedy approach for small $k$. Specifically, we show that for $k = 1$, the algorithm does not improve upon the halving-based bound of $O(\log(|\mathcal{C}|))$. Furthermore, for $k = 2$, we complement the upper bound of $O\left(\log(\log(|\mathcal{C}|))\right)$ from [Moran, Shpilka, Wigderson, and Yuhudayoff; FOCS 2015] with a matching lower bound. Most consequentially, our lower bound extends up to $k \le \lceil c d \rceil$ for small constant $c>0$: suggesting that studying higher-order interactions may be necessary to resolve the conjecture that $\operatorname{TS}_{\min} = O(d)$.

<title>PROM: Prioritize Reduction of Multiplications Over Lower Bit-Widths for Efficient CNNs</title>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are crucial for computer vision tasks on resource-constrained devices. Quantization effectively compresses these models, reducing storage size and energy cost. However, in modern depthwise-separable architectures, the computational cost is distributed unevenly across its components, with pointwise operations being the most expensive. By applying a general quantization scheme to this imbalanced cost distribution, existing quantization approaches fail to fully exploit potential efficiency gains. To this end, we introduce PROM, a straightforward approach for quantizing modern depthwise-separable convolutional networks by selectively using two distinct bit-widths. Specifically, pointwise convolutions are quantized to ternary weights, while the remaining modules use 8-bit weights, which is achieved through a simple quantization-aware training procedure. Additionally, by quantizing activations to 8-bit, our method transforms pointwise convolutions with ternary weights into int8 additions, which enjoy broad support across hardware platforms and effectively eliminates the need for expensive multiplications. Applying PROM to MobileNetV2 reduces the model's energy cost by more than an order of magnitude (23.9x) and its storage size by 2.7x compared to the float16 baseline while retaining similar classification performance on ImageNet. Our method advances the Pareto frontier for energy consumption vs. top-1 accuracy for quantized convolutional models on ImageNet. PROM addresses the challenges of quantizing depthwise-separable convolutional networks to both ternary and 8-bit weights, offering a simple way to reduce energy cost and storage size.

Abstract: We present Mixture of Discrete-time Gaussian Processes (MiDiGap), a novel approach for flexible policy representation and imitation learning in robot manipulation. MiDiGap enables learning from as few as five demonstrations using only camera observations and generalizes across a wide range of challenging tasks. It excels at long-horizon behaviors such as making coffee, highly constrained motions such as opening doors, dynamic actions such as scooping with a spatula, and multimodal tasks such as hanging a mug. MiDiGap learns these tasks on a CPU in less than a minute and scales linearly to large datasets. We also develop a rich suite of tools for inference-time steering using evidence such as collision signals and robot kinematic constraints. This steering enables novel generalization capabilities, including obstacle avoidance and cross-embodiment policy transfer. MiDiGap achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse few-shot manipulation benchmarks. On constrained RLBench tasks, it improves policy success by 76 percentage points and reduces trajectory cost by 67%. On multimodal tasks, it improves policy success by 48 percentage points and increases sample efficiency by a factor of 20. In cross-embodiment transfer, it more than doubles policy success. We make the code publicly available at https://midigap.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Neurofeedback training (NFT) aims to teach self-regulation of brain activity through real-time feedback, but suffers from highly variable outcomes and poorly understood mechanisms, hampering its validation. To address these issues, we propose a formal computational model of the NFT closed loop. Using Active Inference, a Bayesian framework modelling perception, action, and learning, we simulate agents interacting with an NFT environment. This enables us to test the impact of design choices (e.g., feedback quality, biomarker validity) and subject factors (e.g., prior beliefs) on training. Simulations show that training effectiveness is sensitive to feedback noise or bias, and to prior beliefs (highlighting the importance of guiding instructions), but also reveal that perfect feedback is insufficient to guarantee high performance. This approach provides a tool for assessing and predicting NFT variability, interpret empirical data, and potentially develop personalized training protocols.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown encouraging capabilities for mapping accurately forests at medium resolution with TanDEM-X interferometric SAR data. Such models, as most of current state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in remote sensing, are trained in a fully-supervised way, which requires a large amount of labeled data for training and validation. In this work, our aim is to exploit the high-resolution capabilities of the TanDEM-X mission to map forests at 6 m. The goal is to overcome the intrinsic limitations posed by midresolution products, which affect, e.g., the detection of narrow roads within vegetated areas and the precise delineation of forested regions contours. To cope with the lack of extended reliable reference datasets at such a high resolution, we investigate self-supervised learning techniques for extracting highly informative representations from the input features, followed by a supervised training step with a significantly smaller number of reliable labels. A 1 m resolution forest/non-forest reference map over Pennsylvania, USA, allows for comparing different training approaches for the development of an effective forest mapping framework with limited labeled samples. We select the best-performing approach over this test region and apply it in a real-case forest mapping scenario over the Amazon rainforest, where only very few labeled data at high resolution are available. In this challenging scenario, the proposed self-supervised framework significantly enhances the classification accuracy with respect to fully-supervised methods, trained using the same amount of labeled data, representing an extremely promising starting point for large-scale, very high-resolution forest mapping with TanDEM-X data.

Abstract: Achieving both realism and controllability in interactive closed-loop traffic simulation remains a key challenge in autonomous driving. Data-driven simulation methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centered simulation framework that conducts open-loop imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and multimodality, followed by closed-loop reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a simple yet effective closed-loop RL fine-tuning strategy that preserves the trajectory-level multimodality through a GRPO-style group-relative advantage formulation, while enhancing controllability and training stability by replacing KL regularization with the dual-clip mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT significantly improves the realism and controllability of generated traffic scenarios, providing a robust platform for evaluating autonomous vehicle performance in diverse and interactive scenarios.

Abstract: Solar flares are among the most powerful and dynamic events in the solar system, resulting from the sudden release of magnetic energy stored in the Sun's atmosphere. These energetic bursts of electromagnetic radiation can release up to 10^32 erg of energy, impacting space weather and posing risks to technological infrastructure and therefore require accurate forecasting of solar flare occurrences and intensities. This study evaluates the predictive performance of three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for classifying solar flares into 4 categories (B, C, M, X). Using the dataset of 13 SHARP parameters, the effectiveness of the models was evaluated in binary and multiclass classification tasks. The analysis utilized 8 principal components (PC), capturing 95% of data variance, and 100 PCs, capturing 97.5% of variance. Our approach uniquely combines binary and multiclass classification with different levels of dimensionality reduction, an innovative methodology not previously explored in the context of solar flare prediction. Employing a 10-fold stratified cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning ensured robust model evaluation. Our findings indicate that Random Forest and XGBoost consistently demonstrate strong performance across all metrics, benefiting significantly from increased dimensionality. The insights of this study enhance future research by optimizing dimensionality reduction techniques and informing model selection for astrophysical tasks. By integrating this newly acquired knowledge into future research, more accurate space weather forecasting systems can be developed, along with a deeper understanding of solar physics.

Abstract: Qubit control protocols have traditionally leveraged a characterisation of the qubit-bath coupling via its power spectral density. Previous work proposed the inference of noise operators that characterise the influence of a classical bath using a grey-box approach that combines deep neural networks with physics-encoded layers. This overall structure is complex and poses challenges in scaling and real-time operations. Here, we show that no expensive neural networks are needed and that this noise operator description admits an efficient parameterisation. We refer to the resulting parameter space as the \textit{quantum feature space} of the qubit dynamics resulting from the coupled bath. We show that the Euclidean distance defined over the quantum feature space provides an effective method for classifying noise processes in the presence of a given set of controls. Using the quantum feature space as the input space for a simple machine learning algorithm (random forest, in this case), we demonstrate that it can effectively classify the stationarity and the broad class of noise processes perturbing a qubit. Finally, we explore how control pulse parameters map to the quantum feature space.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a landmark achievement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), demonstrating unprecedented proficiency in procedural tasks such as text generation, code completion, and conversational coherence. These capabilities stem from their architecture, which mirrors human procedural memory -- the brain's ability to automate repetitive, pattern-driven tasks through practice. However, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it becomes impossible to ignore their limitations operating in complex, unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs, while transformative, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on procedural memory. To create agents capable of navigating ``wicked'' learning environments -- where rules shift, feedback is ambiguous, and novelty is the norm -- we must augment LLMs with semantic memory and associative learning systems. By adopting a modular architecture that decouples these cognitive functions, we can bridge the gap between narrow procedural expertise and the adaptive intelligence required for real-world problem-solving.

Abstract: The potential for large language models (LLMs) to hide messages within plain text (steganography) poses a challenge to detection and thwarting of unaligned AI agents, and undermines faithfulness of LLMs reasoning. We explore the steganographic capabilities of LLMs fine-tuned via reinforcement learning (RL) to: (1) develop covert encoding schemes, (2) engage in steganography when prompted, and (3) utilize steganography in realistic scenarios where hidden reasoning is likely, but not prompted. In these scenarios, we detect the intention of LLMs to hide their reasoning as well as their steganography performance. Our findings in the fine-tuning experiments as well as in behavioral non fine-tuning evaluations reveal that while current models exhibit rudimentary steganographic abilities in terms of security and capacity, explicit algorithmic guidance markedly enhances their capacity for information concealment.

Abstract: Speech denoising is a generally adopted and impactful task, appearing in many common and everyday-life use cases. Although there are very powerful methods published, most of those are too complex for deployment in everyday and low-resources computational environments, like hand-held devices, intelligent glasses, hearing aids, etc. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent way for alleviating this complexity mismatch and is based on the transferring/distilling of knowledge from a pre-trained complex model, the teacher, to another less complex one, the student. Existing KD methods for speech denoising are based on processes that potentially hamper the KD by bounding the learning of the student to the distribution, information ordering, and feature dimensionality learned by the teacher. In this paper, we present and assess a method that tries to treat this issue, by exploiting the well-known denoising-autoencoder framework, the linear inverted bottlenecks, and the properties of the cosine similarity. We use a public dataset and conduct repeated experiments with different mismatching scenarios between the teacher and the student, reporting the mean and standard deviation of the metrics of our method and another, state-of-the-art method that is used as a baseline. Our results show that with the proposed method, the student can perform better and can also retain greater mismatching conditions compared to the teacher.

Abstract: Finding the optimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) configuration for a given use case can be complex and expensive. Motivated by this challenge, frameworks for RAG hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) have recently emerged, yet their effectiveness has not been rigorously benchmarked. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive study involving 5 HPO algorithms over 5 datasets from diverse domains, including a new one collected for this work on real-world product documentation. Our study explores the largest HPO search space considered to date, with two optimized evaluation metrics. Analysis of the results shows that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with iterative random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for all datasets. For greedy HPO approaches, we show that optimizing models first is preferable to the prevalent practice of optimizing sequentially according to the RAG pipeline order.

<title>Blending 3D Geometry and Machine Learning for Multi-View Stereopsis</title>

Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.

Abstract: Arena-based evaluation is a fundamental yet significant evaluation paradigm for modern AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). Existing framework based on ELO rating system suffers from the inevitable instability problem due to ranking inconsistency and the lack of attention to the varying abilities of annotators. In this paper, we introduce a novel stable arena framework to address these issues by enhancing the ELO Rating System. Specifically, we replace the iterative update method with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and provide theoretical proof of the consistency and stability of the MLE approach for model ranking. Additionally, we proposed the am-ELO, which modify the Elo Rating's probability function to incorporate annotator abilities, enabling the simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate that this method ensures stability, proving that this framework offers a more robust, accurate, and stable evaluation method for LLMs.

Abstract: The increasing availability of user data on music streaming platforms opens up new possibilities for analyzing music consumption. However, understanding the evolution of user preferences remains a complex challenge, particularly as their musical tastes change over time. This paper uses the dictionary learning paradigm to model user trajectories across different musical genres. We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We show that pathlet learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work improves our understanding of users' interactions with music and opens up avenues of research into user behavior and fostering diversity in recommender systems. A dataset of 2000 user histories tagged by genre over 17 months, supplied by Deezer (a leading music streaming company), is also released with the code.

<title>Faster MoE LLM Inference for Extremely Large Models</title>

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs) are gradually becoming the mainstream approach for ultra-large-scale models. Existing optimization efforts for MoE models have focused primarily on coarse-grained MoE architectures. With the emergence of DeepSeek Models, fine-grained MoE models are gaining popularity, yet research on them remains limited. Therefore, we want to discuss the efficiency dynamic under different service loads. Additionally, fine-grained models allow deployers to reduce the number of routed experts, both activated counts and total counts, raising the question of how this reduction affects the trade-off between MoE efficiency and performance. Our findings indicate that while deploying MoE models presents greater challenges, it also offers significant optimization opportunities. Reducing the number of activated experts can lead to substantial efficiency improvements in certain scenarios, with only minor performance degradation. Reducing the total number of experts provides limited efficiency gains but results in severe performance degradation. Our method can increase throughput by at least 10\% without any performance degradation. Overall, we conclude that MoE inference optimization remains an area with substantial potential for exploration and improvement.

<title>Decision Making under Model Misspecification: DRO with Robust Bayesian Ambiguity Sets</title>

Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimisation (DRO) protects risk-averse decision-makers by considering the worst-case risk within an ambiguity set of distributions based on the empirical distribution or a model. To further guard against finite, noisy data, model-based approaches admit Bayesian formulations that propagate uncertainty from the posterior to the decision-making problem. However, when the model is misspecified, the decision maker must stretch the ambiguity set to contain the data-generating process (DGP), leading to overly conservative decisions. We address this challenge by introducing DRO with Robust, to model misspecification, Bayesian Ambiguity Sets (DRO-RoBAS). These are Maximum Mean Discrepancy ambiguity sets centred at a robust posterior predictive distribution that incorporates beliefs about the DGP. We show that the resulting optimisation problem obtains a dual formulation in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and we give probabilistic guarantees on the tolerance level of the ambiguity set. Our method outperforms other Bayesian and empirical DRO approaches in out-of-sample performance on the Newsvendor and Portfolio problems with various cases of model misspecification.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive technique to measure the metabolic composition of tissues, offering valuable insights into neurological disorders, tumor detection, and other metabolic dysfunctions. However, accurate metabolite quantification is hindered by challenges such as spectral overlap, low signal-to-noise ratio, and various artifacts. Traditional methods like linear-combination modeling are susceptible to ambiguities and commonly only provide a theoretical lower bound on estimation accuracy in the form of the Cram\'er-Rao bound. This work introduces a Bayesian inference framework using Sylvester normalizing flows (SNFs) to approximate posterior distributions over metabolite concentrations, enhancing quantification reliability. A physics-based decoder incorporates prior knowledge of MRS signal formation, ensuring realistic distribution representations. We validate the method on simulated 7T proton MRS data, demonstrating accurate metabolite quantification, well-calibrated uncertainties, and insights into parameter correlations and multi-modal distributions.

Abstract: Artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons were recently introduced as an alternative to threshold units. Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory units outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object discovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for these oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto equation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this research note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes oscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism between them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and threshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold units model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate information exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between these two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical systems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to Hopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a specific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems can be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model, which also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible. Notably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction to the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed either as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for fine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization of this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments.

Abstract: Modeling of intricate relational patterns % through the analysis structures of network data has become a cornerstone of contemporary statistical research and related data science fields. Networks, represented as graphs, offer a natural framework for this analysis. This paper extends the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted graphs, markedly broadening the model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit heterogeneous weight distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG model that assigns a sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products of these nodal vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights' distribution via moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior art, the WRDPG can discriminate between weight distributions that share the same mean but differ in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical guarantees for an estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the workhorse adjacency spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and asymptotic normality. We also contribute a generative framework that enables sampling of graphs that adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG, facilitating, e.g., the analysis and testing of observed graph metrics using judicious reference distributions. The paper is organized to formalize the model's definition, the estimation (or nodal embedding) process and its guarantees, as well as the methodologies for generating weighted graphs, all complemented by illustrative and reproducible examples showcasing the WRDPG's effectiveness in various network analytic applications.

Abstract: Motivated by applications in classification of vector valued measures and multispecies PDE, we develop a theory that unifies existing notions of vector valued optimal transport, from dynamic formulations (\`a la Benamou-Brenier) to static formulations (\`a la Kantorovich). In our framework, vector valued measures are modeled as probability measures on a product space $\mathbb{R}^d \times G$, where $G$ is a weighted graph over a finite set of nodes and the graph geometry strongly influences the associated dynamic and static distances. We obtain sharp inequalities relating four notions of vector valued optimal transport and prove that the distances are mutually bi-H\"older equivalent. We discuss the theoretical and practical advantages of each metric and indicate potential applications in multispecies PDE and data analysis. In particular, one of the static formulations discussed in the paper is amenable to linearization, a technique that has been explored in recent years to accelerate the computation of pairwise optimal transport distances.

Abstract: The rapid progress in question-answering (QA) systems has predominantly benefited high-resource languages, leaving Indic languages largely underrepresented despite their vast native speaker base. In this paper, we present IndicSQuAD, a comprehensive multi-lingual extractive QA dataset covering nine major Indic languages, systematically derived from the SQuAD dataset. Building on previous work with MahaSQuAD for Marathi, our approach adapts and extends translation techniques to maintain high linguistic fidelity and accurate answer-span alignment across diverse languages. IndicSQuAD comprises extensive training, validation, and test sets for each language, providing a robust foundation for model development. We evaluate baseline performances using language-specific monolingual BERT models and the multilingual MuRIL-BERT. The results indicate some challenges inherent in low-resource settings. Moreover, our experiments suggest potential directions for future work, including expanding to additional languages, developing domain-specific datasets, and incorporating multimodal data. The dataset and models are publicly shared at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp

Abstract: Automating leaf manipulation in agricultural settings faces significant challenges, including the variability of plant morphologies and deformable leaves. We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf grasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through self-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance segmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf representations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and a neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution of each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework uses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate training data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0% success rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse conditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and neural (60.2%) methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for agricultural robotics where domain expertise is seamlessly integrated with machine learning capabilities, providing a foundation for fully automated crop monitoring systems.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) allow to embed texts and images in a shared representation space. However, it has been shown that these models are subject to a modality gap phenomenon meaning there exists a clear separation between the embeddings from one modality and another in the embedding space. While this misalignment is detrimental for downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, multimodal clustering or zero-shot classification, etc. no generic and practical methods have so far been proposed to assess it precisely and even reduce it. We therefore propose novel measures and effective techniques (spectral- and optimal transport-based methods) to achieve this goal. Extensive experiments conducted on several image-text datasets and models demonstrate their effectiveness and beneficial effects on downstream tasks. Our code is available at the URL provided in the paper's abstract.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach called multi-modal cascade model with feature transfer for polymer property prediction.Polymers are characterized by a composite of data in several different formats, including molecular descriptors and additive information as well as chemical structures. However, in conventional approaches, prediction models were often constructed using each type of data separately. Our model enables more accurate prediction of physical properties for polymers by combining features extracted from the chemical structure by graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) with features such as molecular descriptors and additive information. The predictive performance of the proposed method is empirically evaluated using several polymer datasets. We report that the proposed method shows high predictive performance compared to the baseline conventional approach using a single feature.

<title>Actor-Critics Can Achieve Optimal Sample Efficiency</title>

Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms have become a cornerstone in reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging the strengths of both policy-based and value-based methods. Despite recent progress in understanding their statistical efficiency, no existing work has successfully learned an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ trajectories with general function approximation when strategic exploration is necessary.
  We address this open problem by introducing a novel actor-critic algorithm that attains a sample-complexity of $O(dH^5 \log|\mathcal{A}|/\epsilon^2 + d H^4 \log|\mathcal{F}|/ \epsilon^2)$ trajectories, and accompanying $\sqrt{T}$ regret when the Bellman eluder dimension $d$ does not increase with $T$ at more than a $\log T$ rate.
  Here, $\mathcal{F}$ is the critic function class, $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, and $H$ is the horizon in the finite horizon MDP setting. Our algorithm integrates optimism, off-policy critic estimation targeting the optimal Q-function, and rare-switching policy resets.
  We extend this to the setting of Hybrid RL, showing that initializing the critic with offline data yields sample efficiency gains compared to purely offline or online RL. Further, utilizing access to offline data, we provide a \textit{non-optimistic} provably efficient actor-critic algorithm that only additionally requires $N_{\text{off}} \geq c_{\text{off}}^*dH^4/\epsilon^2$ in exchange for omitting optimism, where $c_{\text{off}}^*$ is the single-policy concentrability coefficient and $N_{\text{off}}$ is the number of offline samples. This addresses another open problem in the literature. We further provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: The classical low-rank matrix recovery problem is well-known to exhibit \emph{benign nonconvexity} under the restricted isometry property (RIP): local optimization is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum, where the ground truth is recovered. We investigate whether benign nonconvexity continues to hold when the factor matrices are constrained to be elementwise nonnegative -- a common practical requirement. In the simple setting of a rank-1 nonnegative ground truth, we confirm that benign nonconvexity holds in the fully-observed case with RIP constant $\delta=0$. Surprisingly, however, this property fails to extend to the partially-observed case with any arbitrarily small RIP constant $\delta\to0^{+}$, irrespective of rank overparameterization. This finding exposes a critical theoretical gap: the continuity argument widely used to explain the empirical robustness of low-rank matrix recovery fundamentally breaks down once nonnegative constraints are imposed.

Abstract: Humanoid robots derive much of their dexterity from hyper-dexterous whole-body movements, enabling tasks that require a large operational workspace: such as picking objects off the ground. However, achieving these capabilities on real humanoids remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom (DoF) and nonlinear dynamics. We propose Adaptive Motion Optimization (AMO), a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) with trajectory optimization for real-time, adaptive whole-body control. To mitigate distribution bias in motion imitation RL, we construct a hybrid AMO dataset and train a network capable of robust, on-demand adaptation to potentially O.O.D. commands. We validate AMO in simulation and on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating superior stability and an expanded workspace compared to strong baselines. Finally, we show that AMO's consistent performance supports autonomous task execution via imitation learning, underscoring the system's versatility and robustness.

Abstract: We study the continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning for reinforcement learning (RL) under the entropy-regularized, exploratory diffusion process formulation introduced by Wang et al. (2020). As the conventional (big) Q-function collapses in continuous time, we consider its first-order approximation and coin the term ``(little) q-function". This function is related to the instantaneous advantage rate function as well as the Hamiltonian. We develop a ``q-learning" theory around the q-function that is independent of time discretization. Given a stochastic policy, we jointly characterize the associated q-function and value function by martingale conditions of certain stochastic processes, in both on-policy and off-policy settings. We then apply the theory to devise different actor-critic algorithms for solving underlying RL problems, depending on whether or not the density function of the Gibbs measure generated from the q-function can be computed explicitly. One of our algorithms interprets the well-known Q-learning algorithm SARSA, and another recovers a policy gradient (PG) based continuous-time algorithm proposed in Jia and Zhou (2022b). Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to compare the performance of our algorithms with those of PG-based algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022b) and time-discretized conventional Q-learning algorithms.

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) sample from a target distribution by iteratively transforming noise using the score function of the perturbed target. For any finite training set, this score function can be evaluated in closed form, but the resulting SGM memorizes its training data and does not generate novel samples. In practice, one approximates the score by training a neural network via score-matching. The error in this approximation promotes generalization, but neural SGMs are costly to train and sample, and the effective regularization this error provides is not well-understood theoretically. In this work, we instead explicitly smooth the closed-form score to obtain an SGM that generates novel samples without training. We analyze our model and propose an efficient nearest-neighbor-based estimator of its score function. Using this estimator, our method achieves competitive sampling times while running on consumer-grade CPUs.

Abstract: Efficient inference of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is essential. Quantization and sparsity are key techniques that translate to repetition and sparsity within tensors at the hardware-software interface. This paper introduces the concept of repetition-sparsity trade-off that helps explain computational efficiency during inference. We propose PLUM, a unified co-design framework that integrates DNN inference systems and quantization (forward and backward pass) to leverage the repetition-sparsity trade-off to improve inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that PLUM's quantization method is more accurate than binary quantization with the same number of non-zero weights. Detailed analysis indicates that signed binarization generates a smaller distribution of effectual (non-zero) parameters nested within a larger distribution of total parameters of latent full-precision weights for a DNN block. Finally, the proposed PLUM framework achieves a 26% speedup on real hardware, doubles energy efficiency, and reduces density by 2.8x compared to binary methods while retaining top-1 accuracy when compared to prior-art methods for ResNets on ImageNet (by achieving 66.2% top-1 accuracy), presenting an alternative solution for deploying efficient models in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models capable of processing graph-structured data, and they have demonstrated significant performance in a variety of real-world applications. Recent studies have found that GNN models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. When specific patterns (called backdoor triggers, e.g., subgraphs, nodes, etc.) appear in the input data, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is activated, which misclassifies the input data into the target class label specified by the attacker, whereas when there are no backdoor triggers in the input, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is not activated, and the models work normally. Backdoor attacks are highly stealthy and expose GNN models to serious security risks. Currently, research on backdoor attacks against GNNs mainly focus on tasks such as graph classification and node classification, and backdoor attacks against link prediction tasks are rarely studied. In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack against the link prediction tasks based on GNNs and reveal the existence of such security vulnerability in GNN models, which make the backdoored GNN models to incorrectly predict unlinked two nodes as having a link relationship when a trigger appear. The method uses a single node as the trigger and poison selected node pairs in the training graph, and then the backdoor will be embedded in the GNN models through the training process. In the inference stage, the backdoor in the GNN models can be activated by simply linking the trigger node to the two end nodes of the unlinked node pairs in the input data, causing the GNN models to produce incorrect link prediction results for the target node pairs.

Abstract: The recently proposed optimization algorithm for deep neural networks Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) suggests perturbing parameters before gradient calculation by a gradient ascent step to guide the optimization into parameter space regions of flat loss. While significant generalization improvements and thus reduction of overfitting could be demonstrated, the computational costs are doubled due to the additionally needed gradient calculation, making SAM unfeasible in case of limited computationally capacities. Motivated by Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) we propose Momentum-SAM (MSAM), which perturbs parameters in the direction of the accumulated momentum vector to achieve low sharpness without significant computational overhead or memory demands over SGD or Adam. We evaluate MSAM in detail and reveal insights on separable mechanisms of NAG, SAM and MSAM regarding training optimization and generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/MarlonBecker/MSAM.

Abstract: Time series modeling presents unique challenges due to autocorrelation in both historical data and future sequences. While current research predominantly addresses autocorrelation within historical data, the correlations among future labels are often overlooked. Specifically, modern forecasting models primarily adhere to the Direct Forecast (DF) paradigm, generating multi-step forecasts independently and disregarding label autocorrelation over time. In this work, we demonstrate that the learning objective of DF is biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. To address this issue, we propose the Frequency-enhanced Direct Forecast (FreDF), which mitigates label autocorrelation by learning to forecast in the frequency domain, thereby reducing estimation bias. Our experiments show that FreDF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with a variety of forecast models. Code is available at https://github.com/Master-PLC/FreDF.

Abstract: The Continuous Learning (CL) paradigm consists of continuously evolving the parameters of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to progressively learn to perform new tasks without reducing the performance on previous tasks, i.e., avoiding the so-called catastrophic forgetting. However, the DNN parameter update in CL-based autonomous systems is extremely resource-hungry. The existing DNN accelerators cannot be directly employed in CL because they only support the execution of the forward propagation. Only a few prior architectures execute the backpropagation and weight update, but they lack the control and management for CL. Towards this, we design a hardware architecture, TinyCL, to perform CL on resource-constrained autonomous systems. It consists of a processing unit that executes both forward and backward propagation, and a control unit that manages memory-based CL workload. To minimize the memory accesses, the sliding window of the convolutional layer moves in a snake-like fashion. Moreover, the Multiply-and-Accumulate units can be reconfigured at runtime to execute different operations. As per our knowledge, our proposed TinyCL represents the first hardware accelerator that executes CL on autonomous systems. We synthesize the complete TinyCL architecture in a 65 nm CMOS technology node with the conventional ASIC design flow. It executes 1 epoch of training on a Conv + ReLU + Dense model on the CIFAR10 dataset in 1.76 s, while 1 training epoch of the same model using an Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU takes 103 s, thus achieving a 58x speedup, consuming 86 mW in a 4.74 mm2 die.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is a powerful and popular operator learning method. However, FNO is mainly used in forward prediction, yet a great many applications rely on solving inverse problems. In this paper, we propose an invertible Fourier Neural Operator (iFNO) for jointly tackling the forward and inverse problems. We developed a series of invertible Fourier blocks in the latent channel space to share the model parameters, exchange the information, and mutually regularize the learning for the bi-directional tasks. We integrated a variational auto-encoder to capture the intrinsic structures within the input space and to enable posterior inference so as to mitigate challenges of illposedness, data shortage, noises that are common in inverse problems. We proposed a three-step process to combine the invertible blocks and the VAE component for effective training. The evaluations on seven benchmark forward and inverse tasks have demonstrated the advantages of our approach.

Abstract: Transport systems on networks are crucial in various applications, but face a significant risk of being adversely affected by unforeseen circumstances such as disasters. The application of entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) on graph structures has been investigated to enhance the robustness of transport on such networks. In this study, we propose an imitation-regularized OT (I-OT) that mathematically incorporates prior knowledge into the robustness of OT. This method is expected to enhance interpretability by integrating human insights into robustness and to accelerate practical applications. Furthermore, we mathematically verify the robustness of I-OT and discuss how these robustness properties relate to real-world applications. The effectiveness of this method is validated through a logistics simulation using automotive parts data.

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) is now a go-to method for pre-training graph foundation models (GFMs). There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, traditional regularization methods tend to directly add regularization terms to the loss function. This paper introduces the "Lai loss", a novel loss design that integrates the regularization terms (specifically, gradients) into the traditional loss function through straightforward geometric concepts. This design penalizes the gradients with the loss itself, allowing for control of the gradients while ensuring maximum accuracy. With this loss, we can effectively control the model's smoothness and sensitivity, potentially offering the dual benefits of improving the model's generalization performance and enhancing its noise resistance on specific features. Additionally, we proposed a training method that successfully addresses the challenges in practical applications. We conducted preliminary experiments using publicly available datasets from Kaggle, demonstrating that the design of Lai loss can control the model's smoothness and sensitivity while maintaining stable model performance.

Abstract: Deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has major computational costs, due to their rapidly expanding size. Compression of LLMs reduces the memory footprint, latency, and energy required for their inference. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have been developed to compress LLMs while avoiding expensive re-training. Most PTQ approaches formulate the quantization error based on a layer-wise Euclidean loss, ignoring the model output. Then, each layer is calibrated using its layer-wise Hessian to update the weights towards minimizing the quantization error. The Hessian is also used for detecting the most salient weights to quantization. Such PTQ approaches are prone to accuracy drop in low-precision quantization. We propose Output-adaptive Calibration (OAC) to incorporate the model output in the calibration process. We formulate the quantization error based on the distortion of the output cross-entropy loss. OAC approximates the output-adaptive Hessian for each layer under reasonable assumptions to reduce the computational complexity. The output-adaptive Hessians are used to update the weight matrices and detect the salient weights towards maintaining the model output. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines such as SpQR and BiLLM, especially, at extreme low-precision (2-bit and binary) quantization.

<title>HINT: Hypernetwork Approach to Training Weight Interval Regions in Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Recently, a new Continual Learning (CL) paradigm was presented to control catastrophic forgetting, called Interval Continual Learning (InterContiNet), which relies on enforcing interval constraints on the neural network parameter space. Unfortunately, InterContiNet training is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the weight space, making intervals difficult to manage. To address this issue, we introduce HINT, a technique that employs interval arithmetic within the embedding space and utilizes a hypernetwork to map these intervals to the target network parameter space. We train interval embeddings for consecutive tasks and train a hypernetwork to transform these embeddings into weights of the target network. An embedding for a given task is trained along with the hypernetwork, preserving the response of the target network for the previous task embeddings. Interval arithmetic works with a more manageable, lower-dimensional embedding space rather than directly preparing intervals in a high-dimensional weight space. Our model allows faster and more efficient training. Furthermore, HINT maintains the guarantee of not forgetting. At the end of training, we can choose one universal embedding to produce a single network dedicated to all tasks. In such a framework, hypernetwork is used only for training and, finally, we can utilize one set of weights. HINT obtains significantly better results than InterContiNet and gives SOTA results on several benchmarks.

<title>A Sharper Global Convergence Analysis for Average Reward Reinforcement Learning via an Actor-Critic Approach</title>

Abstract: This work examines average-reward reinforcement learning with general policy parametrization. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) guarantees for this problem are either suboptimal or hindered by several challenges, including poor scalability with respect to the size of the state-action space, high iteration complexity, and dependence on knowledge of mixing times and hitting times. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-level Monte Carlo-based Natural Actor-Critic (MLMC-NAC) algorithm. Our work is the first to achieve a global convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ for average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) (where $T$ is the horizon length), without requiring the knowledge of mixing and hitting times. Moreover, the convergence rate does not scale with the size of the state space, therefore even being applicable to infinite state spaces.

Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning improves performance by capturing environmental stochasticity, but a comprehensive theoretical understanding of its effectiveness remains elusive. In addition, the intractable element of the infinite dimensionality of distributions has been overlooked. In this paper, we present a regret analysis of distributional reinforcement learning with general value function approximation in a finite episodic Markov decision process setting. We first introduce a key notion of $\textit{Bellman unbiasedness}$ which is essential for exactly learnable and provably efficient distributional updates in an online manner. Among all types of statistical functionals for representing infinite-dimensional return distributions, our theoretical results demonstrate that only moment functionals can exactly capture the statistical information. Secondly, we propose a provably efficient algorithm, $\texttt{SF-LSVI}$, that achieves a tight regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d_E H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{K})$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $d_E$ is the eluder dimension of a function class.

Abstract: Matching is a popular approach in causal inference to estimate treatment effects by pairing treated and control units that are most similar in terms of their covariate information. However, classic matching methods completely ignore the geometry of the data manifold, which is crucial to define a meaningful distance for matching, and struggle when covariates are noisy and high-dimensional. In this work, we propose GeoMatching, a matching method to estimate treatment effects that takes into account the intrinsic data geometry induced by existing causal mechanisms among the confounding variables. First, we learn a low-dimensional, latent Riemannian manifold that accounts for uncertainty and geometry of the original input data. Second, we estimate treatment effects via matching in the latent space based on the learned latent Riemannian metric. We provide theoretical insights and empirical results in synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating that GeoMatching yields more effective treatment effect estimators, even as we increase input dimensionality, in the presence of outliers, or in semi-supervised scenarios.

Abstract: Meta-learning seeks to learn a well-generalized model initialization from training tasks to solve unseen tasks. From the "learning to learn" perspective, the quality of the initialization is modeled with one-step gradient decent in the inner loop. However, contrary to theoretical expectations, our empirical analysis reveals that this may expose meta-learning to underfitting. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation, we reconsider meta-learning from the "Learning" lens. We propose that the meta-learning model comprises two interrelated components: parameters for model initialization and a meta-layer for task-specific fine-tuning. These components will lead to the risks of overfitting and underfitting depending on tasks, and their solutions, fewer parameters vs. more meta-layer, are often in conflict. To address this, we aim to regulate the task information the model receives without modifying the data or model structure. Our theoretical analysis indicates that models adapted to different tasks can mutually reinforce each other, highlighting the effective information. Based on this insight, we propose TRLearner, a plug-and-play method that leverages task relation to calibrate meta-learning. It first extracts task relation matrices and then applies relation-aware consistency regularization to guide optimization. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness.

Abstract: In Explainable AI (XAI), Shapley values are a popular model-agnostic framework for explaining predictions made by complex machine learning models. The computation of Shapley values requires estimating non-trivial contribution functions representing predictions with only a subset of the features present. As the number of these terms grows exponentially with the number of features, computational costs escalate rapidly, creating a pressing need for efficient and accurate approximation methods. For tabular data, the KernelSHAP framework is considered the state-of-the-art model-agnostic approximation framework. KernelSHAP approximates the Shapley values using a weighted sample of the contribution functions for different feature subsets. We propose a novel modification of KernelSHAP which replaces the stochastic weights with deterministic ones to reduce the variance of the resulting Shapley value approximations. This may also be combined with our simple, yet effective modification to the KernelSHAP variant implemented in the popular Python library SHAP. Additionally, we provide an overview of established methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods can reduce the required number of contribution function evaluations by $5\%$ to $50\%$ while preserving the same accuracy of the approximated Shapley values -- essentially reducing the running time by up to $50\%$. These computational advancements push the boundaries of the feature dimensionality and number of predictions that can be accurately explained with Shapley values within a feasible runtime.

Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.

Abstract: Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface. However, forecasts produced by machine learning models or numerical weather prediction systems are typically generated on large-scale regular grids, where direct downscaling fails to capture fine-grained, near-surface weather patterns. In this work, we propose a multi-modal transformer model trained end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. Our model directly combines local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature, dewpoint) with gridded forecasts to produce locally accurate predictions at various lead times. Multiple data modalities are collected and concatenated at station-level locations, treated as a token at each station. Using self-attention, the token corresponding to the target location aggregates information from its neighboring tokens. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. They also reveal that direct input of station data provides a phase shift in local weather forecasting accuracy, reducing the prediction error by up to 80% compared to pure gridded data based models. This approach demonstrates how to bridge the gap between large-scale weather models and locally accurate forecasts to support high-stakes, location-sensitive decision-making.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills directly from expert demonstrations, providing a compelling alternative to reinforcement learning. However, prior online IL approaches struggle with complex tasks characterized by high-dimensional inputs and complex dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that leverages reward-free world models. Our method learns environmental dynamics entirely in latent spaces without reconstruction, enabling efficient and accurate modeling. We adopt the inverse soft-Q learning objective, reformulating the optimization process in the Q-policy space to mitigate the instability associated with traditional optimization in the reward-policy space. By employing a learned latent dynamics model and planning for control, our approach consistently achieves stable, expert-level performance in tasks with high-dimensional observation or action spaces and intricate dynamics. We evaluate our method on a diverse set of benchmarks, including DMControl, MyoSuite, and ManiSkill2, demonstrating superior empirical performance compared to existing approaches.

In this paper, we examine machine unlearning from an optimization perspective, framing it as a regularized multi-task optimization problem, where one task optimizes a forgetting objective and another optimizes the model performance. In particular, we introduce a normalized gradient difference (NGDiff) algorithm, enabling us to have better control over the trade-off between the objectives, while integrating a new, automatic learning rate scheduler. We provide a theoretical analysis and empirically demonstrate the superior performance of NGDiff among state-of-the-art unlearning methods on the TOFU and MUSE datasets while exhibiting stable training.

Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.

Abstract: While recent advancements in machine learning, such as LLMs, are revolutionizing software development and creative industries, they have had minimal impact on engineers designing mechanical parts, which remains largely a manual process. Existing approaches to generating 3D geometry most commonly use meshes as a 3D representation. While meshes are suitable for assets in video games or animations, they lack sufficient precision and adaptability for mechanical engineering purposes. This paper introduces a novel approach for the generation of 3D geometry that generates surface-based Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) by leveraging a code-generation LLM. First, we create a dataset of 3D mechanical parts represented as code scripts by converting Boundary Representation geometry (BREP) into CSG-based Python scripts. Second, we create annotations in natural language using GPT-4. The resulting dataset is used to fine-tune a code-generation LLM. The fine-tuned LLM can complete geometries based on positional input and natural language in a plausible way, demonstrating geometric understanding.

Abstract: Business documents often contain substantial tabular and textual information with numerical values, requiring mathematical reasoning for effective document understanding. While Small Language Models (SLMs) still struggle at this task, tool-augmented multi-step agents perform better, at the cost of relying on closed-source or larger models, external data, or extensive prompt-engineering. This work introduces MATATA, a novel weakly supervised end-to-end approach to train multi-step reasoning language agents for document tabular applications. MATATA presents an annotation-free paradigm for each agent to enhance 3.8B/8B SLMs. During its two-stage training, MATATA uses the final outcome of the multi-step reasoning chain as weak supervision. This approach avoids having to individually supervise each intermediate agent in the reasoning chain. By employing an adaptive planner and shared tools across different datasets, MATATA shows robust performance. Experiments demonstrate that MATATA achieves state-of-the-art on FinQA, and on TAT-QA among reasoning methods based on open-source SLMs. Although being SLM-based, MATATA closely matches GPT-4-based frameworks on TabMWP. This novel weakly supervised approach enables training an end-to-end multi-step reasoning agent without intermediate supervision, supporting future developments of cost-effective powerful agentic systems.

Abstract: While one commonly trains large diffusion models by collecting datasets on target downstream tasks, it is often desired to align and finetune pretrained diffusion models with some reward functions that are either designed by experts or learned from small-scale datasets. Existing post-training methods for reward finetuning of diffusion models typically suffer from lack of diversity in generated samples, lack of prior preservation, and/or slow convergence in finetuning. In response to this challenge, we take inspiration from recent successes in generative flow networks (GFlowNets) and propose a reinforcement learning method for diffusion model finetuning, dubbed Nabla-GFlowNet (abbreviated as $\nabla$-GFlowNet), that leverages the rich signal in reward gradients for probabilistic diffusion finetuning. We show that our proposed method achieves fast yet diversity- and prior-preserving finetuning of Stable Diffusion, a large-scale text-conditioned image diffusion model, on different realistic reward functions.

Abstract: Non-Centralized Continual Learning (NCCL) has become an emerging paradigm for enabling distributed devices such as vehicles and servers to handle streaming data from a joint non-stationary environment. To achieve high reliability and scalability in deploying this paradigm in distributed systems, it is essential to conquer challenges stemming from both spatial and temporal dimensions, manifesting as distribution shifts, catastrophic forgetting, heterogeneity, and privacy issues. This survey focuses on a comprehensive examination of the development of the non-centralized continual learning algorithms and the real-world deployment across distributed devices. We begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of non-centralized learning and continual learning. Then, we review existing solutions from three levels to represent how existing techniques alleviate the catastrophic forgetting and distribution shift. Additionally, we delve into the various types of heterogeneity issues, security, and privacy attributes, as well as real-world applications across three prevalent scenarios. Furthermore, we establish a large-scale benchmark to revisit this problem and analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art NCCL approaches. Finally, we discuss the important challenges and future research directions in NCCL.

Abstract: We present HardML, a benchmark designed to evaluate the knowledge and reasoning abilities in the fields of data science and machine learning. HardML comprises a diverse set of 100 challenging multiple-choice questions, handcrafted over a period of 6 months, covering the most popular and modern branches of data science and machine learning. These questions are challenging even for a typical Senior Machine Learning Engineer to answer correctly. To minimize the risk of data contamination, HardML uses mostly original content devised by the author. Current state of the art AI models achieve a 30% error rate on this benchmark, which is about 3 times larger than the one achieved on the equivalent, well known MMLU ML. While HardML is limited in scope and not aiming to push the frontier, primarily due to its multiple choice nature, it serves as a rigorous and modern testbed to quantify and track the progress of top AI. While plenty benchmarks and experimentation in LLM evaluation exist in other STEM fields like mathematics, physics and chemistry, the subfields of data science and machine learning remain fairly underexplored.

Abstract: Tensor-network Born machines (TNBMs) are quantum-inspired generative models for learning data distributions. Using tensor-network contraction and optimization techniques, the model learns an efficient representation of the target distribution, capable of capturing complex correlations with a compact parameterization. Despite their promise, the optimization of TNBMs presents several challenges. A key bottleneck of TNBMs is the logarithmic nature of the loss function commonly used for this problem. The single-tensor logarithmic optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, necessitating an iterative approach that slows down convergence and increases the risk of getting trapped in one of many non-optimal local minima. In this paper, we present an improved second-order optimization technique for TNBM training, which significantly enhances convergence rates and the quality of the optimized model. Our method employs a modified Newton's method on the manifold of normalized states, incorporating regularization of the loss landscape to mitigate local minima issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) on both discrete and continuous datasets, showcasing its advantages in terms of stability and efficiency, and demonstrating its potential as a robust and scalable approach for optimizing quantum-inspired generative models.

Abstract: Binary and sparse ternary weights in neural networks enable faster computations and lighter representations, facilitating their use on edge devices with limited computational power. Meanwhile, vanilla RNNs are highly sensitive to changes in their recurrent weights, making the binarization and ternarization of these weights inherently challenging. To date, no method has successfully achieved binarization or ternarization of vanilla RNN weights. We present a new approach leveraging the properties of Hadamard matrices to parameterize a subset of binary and sparse ternary orthogonal matrices. This method enables the training of orthogonal RNNs (ORNNs) with binary and sparse ternary recurrent weights, effectively creating a specific class of binary and sparse ternary vanilla RNNs. The resulting ORNNs, called HadamRNN and Block-HadamRNN, are evaluated on benchmarks such as the copy task, permuted and sequential MNIST tasks, the IMDB dataset, two GLUE benchmarks, and two IoT benchmarks. Despite binarization or sparse ternarization, these RNNs maintain performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art full-precision models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our approach is the first solution with binary recurrent weights capable of tackling the copy task over 1000 timesteps.

<title>An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by 12.52% on MSE and 6.34% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.

<title>Using Mechanistic Interpretability to Craft Adversarial Attacks against Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Traditional white-box methods for creating adversarial perturbations against LLMs typically rely only on gradient computation from the targeted model, ignoring the internal mechanisms responsible for attack success or failure. Conversely, interpretability studies that analyze these internal mechanisms lack practical applications beyond runtime interventions. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel white-box approach that leverages mechanistic interpretability techniques to craft practical adversarial inputs. Specifically, we first identify acceptance subspaces - sets of feature vectors that do not trigger the model's refusal mechanisms - then use gradient-based optimization to reroute embeddings from refusal subspaces to acceptance subspaces, effectively achieving jailbreaks. This targeted approach significantly reduces computation cost, achieving attack success rates of 80-95\% on state-of-the-art models including Gemma2, Llama3.2, and Qwen2.5 within minutes or even seconds, compared to existing techniques that often fail or require hours of computation. We believe this approach opens a new direction for both attack research and defense development. Furthermore, it showcases a practical application of mechanistic interpretability where other methods are less efficient, which highlights its utility. The code and generated datasets are available at https://github.com/Sckathach/subspace-rerouting.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) technique, enabling the non-contact acquisition of extensive ground observations, is a valuable tool for crop yield predictions. Traditional process-based models struggle to incorporate large volumes of RS data, and most users lack understanding of crop growth mechanisms. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models are often criticized as "black boxes" due to their limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we utilized Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), a framework that leverages the strengths of both process-based and ML models. Existing works have either overlooked the role of soil moisture in corn growth or did not embed this effect into their models. To bridge this gap, we developed the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture (KGML-SM) framework, treating soil moisture as an intermediate variable in corn growth to emphasize its key role in plant development. Additionally, based on the prior knowledge that the model may overestimate under drought conditions, we designed a drought-aware loss function that penalized predicted yield in drought-affected areas. Our experiments showed that the KGML-SM model outperformed other traditional ML models. We explored the relationships between drought, soil moisture, and corn yield prediction by assessing the importance of different features within the model, and analyzing how soil moisture impacts predictions across different regions and time periods. Finally we provided interpretability for prediction errors to guide future model optimization.

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) operating in hyperbolic spaces have shown promise for modeling hierarchical and complex relational data, a critical limitation often overlooked is their potentially limited discriminative power compared to their Euclidean counterparts or fundamental graph isomorphism tests like the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. Existing hyperbolic aggregation schemes, while curvature-aware, may not sufficiently capture the intricate structural differences required to robustly distinguish non-isomorphic graphs owing to non-injective aggregation functions. To address this expressiveness gap in hyperbolic graph learning, we introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel GNN designed to achieve enhanced discriminative capabilities within the Lorentzian model of hyperbolic space. LGIN proposes a new update rule that effectively combines local neighborhood information with a richer representation of graph structure designed to preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor. This represents a significant step towards building more expressive GNNs in non-Euclidean geometries, overcoming a common bottleneck in current hyperbolic methods. We conduct extensive evaluations across nine diverse benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures. LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean GNNs, showcasing its practical efficacy and validating its superior ability to capture complex graph structures and distinguish between different graphs. To the best of our knowledge, LGIN is the first work to study the framework behind a powerful GNN on the hyperbolic space. The code for our paper can be found at https://github.com/Deceptrax123/LGIN

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: We introduce combinatorial interpretability, a methodology for understanding neural computation by analyzing the combinatorial structures in the sign-based categorization of a network's weights and biases. We demonstrate its power through feature channel coding, a theory that explains how neural networks compute Boolean expressions and potentially underlies other categories of neural network computation. According to this theory, features are computed via feature channels: unique cross-neuron encodings shared among the inputs the feature operates on. Because different feature channels share neurons, the neurons are polysemantic and the channels interfere with one another, making the computation appear inscrutable.
  We show how to decipher these computations by analyzing a network's feature channel coding, offering complete mechanistic interpretations of several small neural networks that were trained with gradient descent. Crucially, this is achieved via static combinatorial analysis of the weight matrices, without examining activations or training new autoencoding networks. Feature channel coding reframes the superposition hypothesis, shifting the focus from neuron activation directionality in high-dimensional space to the combinatorial structure of codes. It also allows us for the first time to exactly quantify and explain the relationship between a network's parameter size and its computational capacity (i.e. the set of features it can compute with low error), a relationship that is implicitly at the core of many modern scaling laws.
  Though our initial studies of feature channel coding are restricted to Boolean functions, we believe they provide a rich, controlled, and informative research space, and that the path we propose for combinatorial interpretation of neural computation can provide a basis for understanding both artificial and biological neural circuits.

<title>Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control for Adaptive Control of Hydrogen-Diesel Dual-Fuel Combustion</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning Integrated Model Predictive Control (ML-MPC) are promising approaches for optimizing hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel engine control, as they can effectively control multiple-input multiple-output systems and nonlinear processes. ML-MPC is advantageous for providing safe and optimal controls, ensuring the engine operates within predefined safety limits. In contrast, RL is distinguished by its adaptability to changing conditions through its learning-based approach. However, the practical implementation of either method alone poses challenges. RL requires high variance in control inputs during early learning phases, which can pose risks to the system by potentially executing unsafe actions, leading to mechanical damage. Conversely, ML-MPC relies on an accurate system model to generate optimal control inputs and has limited adaptability to system drifts, such as injector aging, which naturally occur in engine applications. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid RL and ML-MPC approach that uses an ML-MPC framework while incorporating an RL agent to dynamically adjust the ML-MPC load tracking reference in response to changes in the environment. At the same time, the ML-MPC ensures that actions stay safe throughout the RL agent's exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, fuel pressure is deliberately varied to introduce a model-plant mismatch between the ML-MPC and the engine test bench. The result of this mismatch is a root mean square error (RMSE) in indicated mean effective pressure of 0.57 bar when running the ML-MPC. The experimental results demonstrate that RL successfully adapts to changing boundary conditions by altering the tracking reference while ML-MPC ensures safe control inputs. The quantitative improvement in load tracking by implementing RL is an RSME of 0.44 bar.

Abstract: Recent work established that rank overparameterization eliminates spurious local minima in nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery under the restricted isometry property (RIP). But this does not fully explain the practical success of overparameterization, because real algorithms can still become trapped at nonstrict saddle points (approximate second-order points with arbitrarily small negative curvature) even when all local minima are global. Moreover, the result does not accommodate for noisy measurements, but it is unclear whether such an extension is even possible, in view of the many discontinuous and unintuitive behaviors already known for the overparameterized regime. In this paper, we introduce a novel proof technique that unifies, simplifies, and strengthens two previously competing approaches -- one based on escape directions and the other based on the inexistence of counterexample -- to provide sharp global guarantees in the noisy overparameterized regime. We show, once local minima have been converted into global minima through slight overparameterization, that near-second-order points achieve the same minimax-optimal recovery bounds (up to small constant factors) as significantly more expensive convex approaches. Our results are sharp with respect to the noise level and the solution accuracy, and hold for both the symmetric parameterization $XX^{T}$, as well as the asymmetric parameterization $UV^{T}$ under a balancing regularizer; we demonstrate that the balancing regularizer is indeed necessary.

Abstract: This paper considers contextual bandits with a finite number of arms, where the contexts are independent and identically distributed $d$-dimensional random vectors, and the expected rewards are linear in both the arm parameters and contexts. The LinUCB algorithm, which is near minimax optimal for related linear bandits, is shown to have a cumulative regret that is suboptimal in both the dimension $d$ and time horizon $T$, due to its over-exploration. A truncated version of LinUCB is proposed and termed "Tr-LinUCB", which follows LinUCB up to a truncation time $S$ and performs pure exploitation afterwards. The Tr-LinUCB algorithm is shown to achieve $O(d\log(T))$ regret if $S = Cd\log(T)$ for a sufficiently large constant $C$, and a matching lower bound is established, which shows the rate optimality of Tr-LinUCB in both $d$ and $T$ under a low dimensional regime. Further, if $S = d\log^{\kappa}(T)$ for some $\kappa>1$, the loss compared to the optimal is a multiplicative $\log\log(T)$ factor, which does not depend on $d$. This insensitivity to overshooting in choosing the truncation time of Tr-LinUCB is of practical importance.

Abstract: In social networks, the discovery of community structures has received considerable attention as a fundamental problem in various network analysis tasks. However, due to privacy concerns or access restrictions, the network structure is often uncertain, thereby rendering established community detection approaches ineffective without costly network topology acquisition. To tackle this challenge, we present META-CODE, a unified framework for detecting overlapping communities via exploratory learning aided by easy-to-collect node metadata when networks are topologically unknown (or only partially known). Specifically, META-CODE consists of three iterative steps in addition to the initial network inference step: 1) node-level community-affiliation embeddings based on graph neural networks (GNNs) trained by our new reconstruction loss, 2) network exploration via community-affiliation-based node queries, and 3) network inference using an edge connectivity-based Siamese neural network model from the explored network. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets including two large networks, we demonstrate: (a) the superiority of META-CODE over benchmark community detection methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 65.55% on the Facebook dataset over the best competitor among our selected competitive methods in terms of normalized mutual information (NMI), (b) the impact of each module in META-CODE, (c) the effectiveness of node queries in META-CODE based on empirical evaluations and theoretical findings, and (d) the convergence of the inferred network.

Abstract: Network-on-Chip (NoC) is widely used to facilitate communication between components in sophisticated System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. Security of the on-chip communication is crucial because exploiting any vulnerability in shared NoC would be a goldmine for an attacker that puts the entire computing infrastructure at risk. We investigate the security strength of existing anonymous routing protocols in NoC architectures, making two pivotal contributions. Firstly, we develop and perform a machine learning (ML)-based flow correlation attack on existing anonymous routing techniques in Network-on-Chip (NoC) systems, revealing that they provide only packet-level anonymity. Secondly, we propose a novel, lightweight anonymous routing protocol featuring outbound traffic tunneling and traffic obfuscation. This protocol is designed to provide robust defense against ML-based flow correlation attacks, ensuring both packet-level and flow-level anonymity. Experimental evaluation using both real and synthetic traffic demonstrates that our proposed attack successfully deanonymizes state-of-the-art anonymous routing in NoC architectures with high accuracy (up to 99%) for diverse traffic patterns. It also reveals that our lightweight anonymous routing protocol can defend against ML-based attacks with minor hardware and performance overhead.

Abstract: The problem of symbolic regression (SR) arises in many different applications, such as identifying physical laws or deriving mathematical equations describing the behavior of financial markets from given data. Various methods exist to address the problem of SR, often based on genetic programming. However, these methods are usually complicated and involve various hyperparameters. In this paper, we present our new approach ParFam that utilizes parametric families of suitable symbolic functions to translate the discrete symbolic regression problem into a continuous one, resulting in a more straightforward setup compared to current state-of-the-art methods. In combination with a global optimizer, this approach results in a highly effective method to tackle the problem of SR. We theoretically analyze the expressivity of ParFam and demonstrate its performance with extensive numerical experiments based on the common SR benchmark suit SRBench, showing that we achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we present an extension incorporating a pre-trained transformer network DL-ParFam to guide ParFam, accelerating the optimization process by up to two magnitudes. Our code and results can be found at https://github.com/Philipp238/parfam.

Abstract: Active learning strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeled data by selecting the most informative instances for labeling. However, existing methods for assessing data informativeness often fail to align directly with task model performance metrics, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. This paper introduces Mean-AP Guided Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness for deep detection networks, directly optimizing the sampling strategy using mAP. MGRAL employs a reinforcement learning agent based on LSTM architecture to efficiently navigate the combinatorial challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable nature between performance and selected batches. The agent optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as the reward signal. To address the computational intensity of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, we implement fast look-up tables, ensuring real-world feasibility. We evaluate MGRAL on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks across various backbone architectures. Our approach demonstrates strong performance, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-based active learning for object detection.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in various domains, including image recognition, medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. Recent advances in dataflow-based CNN accelerators have enabled CNN inference in resource-constrained edge devices. These dataflow accelerators utilize inherent data reuse of convolution layers to process CNN models efficiently. Concealing the architecture of CNN models is critical for privacy and security. This article evaluates memory-based side-channel information to recover CNN architectures from dataflow-based CNN inference accelerators. The proposed attack exploits spatial and temporal data reuse of the dataflow mapping on CNN accelerators and architectural hints to recover the structure of CNN models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed side-channel attack can recover the structures of popular CNN models, namely, Lenet, Alexnet, VGGnet16, and YOLOv2.

<title>Causal Structure Representation Learning of Confounders in Latent Space for Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Inferring user preferences from the historical feedback of users is a valuable problem in recommender systems. Conventional approaches often rely on the assumption that user preferences in the feedback data are equivalent to the real user preferences without additional noise, which simplifies the problem modeling. However, there are various confounders during user-item interactions, such as weather and even the recommendation system itself. Therefore, neglecting the influence of confounders will result in inaccurate user preferences and suboptimal performance of the model. Furthermore, the unobservability of confounders poses a challenge in further addressing the problem. To address these issues, we refine the problem and propose a more rational solution. Specifically, we consider the influence of confounders, disentangle them from user preferences in the latent space, and employ causal graphs to model their interdependencies without specific labels. By cleverly combining local and global causal graphs, we capture the user-specificity of confounders on user preferences. We theoretically demonstrate the identifiability of the obtained causal graph. Finally, we propose our model based on Variational Autoencoders, named Causal Structure representation learning of Confounders in latent space (CSC). We conducted extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and five real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned causal representations of confounders are controllable, potentially offering users fine-grained control over the objectives of their recommendation lists with the learned causal graphs.

Abstract: Given an intractable distribution $p$, the problem of variational inference (VI) is to find the best approximation from some more tractable family $Q$. Commonly, one chooses $Q$ to be a family of factorized distributions (i.e., the mean-field assumption), even though~$p$ itself does not factorize. We show that this mismatch leads to an impossibility theorem: if $p$ does not factorize, then any factorized approximation $q\in Q$ can correctly estimate at most one of the following three measures of uncertainty: (i) the marginal variances, (ii) the marginal precisions, or (iii) the generalized variance (which can be related to the entropy). In practice, the best variational approximation in $Q$ is found by minimizing some divergence $D(q,p)$ between distributions, and so we ask: how does the choice of divergence determine which measure of uncertainty, if any, is correctly estimated by VI? We consider the classic Kullback-Leibler divergences, the more general $\alpha$-divergences, and a score-based divergence which compares $\nabla \log p$ and $\nabla \log q$. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis in the setting where $p$ is a Gaussian and $q$ is a (factorized) Gaussian. We show that all the considered divergences can be \textit{ordered} based on the estimates of uncertainty they yield as objective functions for~VI. Finally, we empirically evaluate the validity of this ordering when the target distribution $p$ is not Gaussian.

Abstract: Tuning the regularization parameter in penalized regression models is an expensive task, requiring multiple models to be fit along a path of parameters. Strong screening rules drastically reduce computational costs by lowering the dimensionality of the input prior to fitting. We develop strong screening rules for group-based Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE) models: Group SLOPE and Sparse-group SLOPE. The developed rules are applicable to the wider family of group-based OWL models, including OSCAR. Our experiments on both synthetic and real data show that the screening rules significantly accelerate the fitting process. The screening rules make it accessible for group SLOPE and sparse-group SLOPE to be applied to high-dimensional datasets, particularly those encountered in genetics.

Abstract: As a core underlying operation in pattern recognition and machine learning, matrix multiplication plays a crucial role in modern machine learning models and constitutes a major contributor to computational expenditure. Hence, researchers have spent decades continuously searching for more efficient matrix multiplication algorithms.This paper firstly introduces an innovative and practical approach to universal quantum matrix multiplication. We designed optimized quantum adders and multipliers based on Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which significantly reduced the number of gates used compared to classical adders and multipliers. Subsequently, we construct the basic universal quantum matrix multiplication and extend it to the Strassen algorithm. We conduct comparative experiments to analyze the performance of the quantum matrix multiplication and evaluate the acceleration provided by the optimized quantum adder and multiplier. Finally, we investigate the advantages of the quantum Strassen algorithm and the basic quantum matrix multiplication. Our result opens, for the first time, a reliable pathway for designing universal quantum matrix multiplication. Following this pathway, quantum computing will unlock significantly greater potential for training modern machine learning models.

<title>The Struggles of LLMs in Cross-lingual Code Clone Detection</title>

arXiv:2408.04430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.

This survey critically evaluates 167 publications, exploring diverse RL applications and frameworks in finance. Financial markets, marked by their complexity, multi-agent nature, information asymmetry, and inherent randomness, serve as an intriguing test-bed for RL. Traditional finance offers certain solutions, and RL advances these with a more dynamic approach, incorporating machine learning methods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi-agent solutions. This survey dissects key RL components through the lens of Quantitative Finance. We uncover emerging themes, propose areas for future research, and critique the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.

Abstract: Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.

Abstract: In the Newsvendor problem, the goal is to guess the number that will be drawn from some distribution, with asymmetric consequences for guessing too high vs. too low. In the data-driven version, the distribution is unknown, and one must work with samples from the distribution. Data-driven Newsvendor has been studied under many variants: additive vs. multiplicative regret, high probability vs. expectation bounds, and different distribution classes. This paper studies all combinations of these variants, filling in many gaps in the literature and simplifying many proofs. In particular, we provide a unified analysis based on the notion of clustered distributions, which in conjunction with our new lower bounds, shows that the entire spectrum of regrets between $1/\sqrt{n}$ and $1/n$ can be possible. Simulations on commonly-used distributions demonstrate that our notion is the "correct" predictor of empirical regret across varying data sizes.

Abstract: Probing learned concepts in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding how semantic knowledge is encoded internally. Training linear classifiers on probing tasks is a principle approach to denote the vector of a certain concept in the representation space. However, the single vector identified for a concept varies with both data and training, making it less robust and weakening its effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to approximate the subspace representing a specific concept. Built on linear probing classifiers, we extend the concept vectors into Gaussian Concept Subspace (GCS). We demonstrate GCS's effectiveness through measuring its faithfulness and plausibility across multiple LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Additionally, we use representation intervention tasks to showcase its efficacy in real-world applications such as emotion steering. Experimental results indicate that GCS concept vectors have the potential to balance steering performance and maintaining the fluency in natural language generation tasks.

Abstract: Given the temporal GPS coordinates from a large set of human agents, how can we model their mobility behavior toward effective anomaly (e.g. bad-actor or malicious behavior) detection without any labeled data? Human mobility and trajectory modeling have been extensively studied, showcasing varying abilities to manage complex inputs and balance performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we formulate anomaly detection in complex human behavior by modeling raw GPS data as a sequence of stay-point events, each characterized by spatio-temporal features, along with trips (i.e. commute) between the stay-points. Our problem formulation allows us to leverage modern sequence models for unsupervised training and anomaly detection. Notably, we equip our proposed model USTAD (for Uncertainty-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection) with aleatoric (i.e. data) uncertainty estimation to account for inherent stochasticity in certain individuals' behavior, as well as epistemic (i.e. model) uncertainty to handle data sparsity under a large variety of human behaviors. Together, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties unlock a robust loss function as well as uncertainty-aware decision-making in anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments shows that USTAD improves anomaly detection AUCROC by 3\%-15\% over baselines in industry-scale data.

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical task in machine learning and statistics. However, existing feature selection methods either (i) rely on parametric methods such as linear or generalized linear models, (ii) lack theoretical false discovery control, or (iii) identify few true positives. Here, we introduce a general feature selection method with finite-sample false discovery control based on applying integrated path stability selection (IPSS) to arbitrary feature importance scores. The method is nonparametric whenever the importance scores are nonparametric, and it estimates q-values, which are better suited to high-dimensional data than p-values. We focus on two special cases using importance scores from gradient boosting (IPSSGB) and random forests (IPSSRF). Extensive nonlinear simulations with RNA sequencing data show that both methods accurately control the false discovery rate and detect more true positives than existing methods. Both methods are also efficient, running in under 20 seconds when there are 500 samples and 5000 features. We apply IPSSGB and IPSSRF to detect microRNAs and genes related to cancer, finding that they yield better predictions with fewer features than existing approaches.

Abstract: In this study, we consider multi-class multi-server asymmetric queueing systems consisting of $N$ queues on one side and $K$ servers on the other side, where jobs randomly arrive in queues at each time. The service rate of each job-server assignment is unknown and modeled by a feature-based Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) function. At each time, a scheduler assigns jobs to servers, and each server stochastically serves at most one job based on its preferences over the assigned jobs. The primary goal of the algorithm is to stabilize the queues in the system while learning the service rates of servers. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms based on UCB and Thompson Sampling, which achieve system stability with an average queue length bound of $O(\min\{N,K\}/\epsilon)$ for a large time horizon $T$, where $\epsilon$ is a traffic slackness of the system. Furthermore, the algorithms achieve sublinear regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\min\{\sqrt{T} Q_{\max},T^{3/4}\})$, where $Q_{\max}$ represents the maximum queue length over agents and times. Lastly, we provide experimental results to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms.

<title>Model-agnostic basis functions for the 2-point correlation function of dark matter in linear theory</title>

arXiv:2410.21374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider approximating the linearly evolved 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of dark matter $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ in a cosmological model with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ as the linear combination $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx\sum_i\,b_i(r)\,w_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, where the functions $\mathcal{B}=\{b_i(r)\}$ form a $\textit{model-agnostic basis}$ for the linear 2pcf. This decomposition is important for model-agnostic analyses of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the nonlinear 2pcf of galaxies that fix $\mathcal{B}$ and leave the coefficients $\{w_i\}$ free. To date, such analyses have made simple but sub-optimal choices for $\mathcal{B}$, such as monomials. We develop a machine learning framework for systematically discovering a $\textit{minimal}$ basis $\mathcal{B}$ that describes $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ near the BAO feature in a wide class of cosmological models. We use a custom architecture, denoted $\texttt{BiSequential}$, for a neural network (NN) that explicitly realizes the separation between $r$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ above. The optimal NN trained on data in which only $\{\Omega_{\rm m},h\}$ are varied in a $\textit{flat}$ $\Lambda$CDM model produces a basis $\mathcal{B}$ comprising $9$ functions capable of describing $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ to $\sim0.6\%$ accuracy in $\textit{curved}$ $w$CDM models varying 7 parameters within $\sim5\%$ of their fiducial, flat $\Lambda$CDM values. Scales such as the peak, linear point and zero-crossing of $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ are also recovered with very high accuracy. We compare our approach to other compression schemes in the literature, and speculate that $\mathcal{B}$ may also encompass $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ in modified gravity models near our fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model. Using our basis functions in model-agnostic BAO analyses can potentially lead to significant statistical gains.

Abstract: Large language models applied to vast biological datasets have the potential to transform biology by uncovering disease mechanisms and accelerating drug development. However, current models are often siloed, trained separately on small-molecules, proteins, or transcriptomic data, limiting their ability to capture complex, multi-modal interactions. Effective drug discovery requires computational tools that integrate multiple biological entities while supporting prediction and generation, a challenge existing models struggle to address. For this purpose, we present MAMMAL - Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language - a versatile method applied to create a multi-task foundation model that learns from large-scale biological datasets across diverse modalities, including proteins, small-molecules, and omics. MAMMAL's structured prompt syntax supports classification, regression, and generation tasks while handling token and scalar inputs and outputs. Evaluated on eleven diverse downstream tasks, it reaches a new state of the art (SOTA) in nine tasks and is comparable to SOTA in two tasks, all within a unified architecture, unlike prior task-specific models. Additionally, we explored Alphafold 3 binding prediction capabilities on antibody-antigen and nanobody-antigen complexes showing significantly better classification performance of MAMMAL in 3 out of 4 targets. The model code and pretrained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-alignment and https://huggingface.co/ibm/biomed.omics.bl.sm.ma-ted-458m

Abstract: Many glass products require thermoformed geometry with high precision. However, the traditional approach of developing a thermoforming process through trials and errors can cause large waste of time and resources and often end up with unsuccessfulness. Hence, there is a need to develop an efficient predictive model, replacing the costly simulations or experiments, to assist the design of precision glass thermoforming. In this work, we report a surrogate model, based on a dimensionless back-propagation neural network (BPNN), that can adequately predict the form errors and thus compensate for these errors in mold design using geometric features and process parameters as inputs. Our trials with simulation and industrial data indicate that the surrogate model can predict forming errors with adequate accuracy. Although perception errors (mold designers' decisions) and mold fabrication errors make the industrial training data less reliable than simulation data, our preliminary training and testing results still achieved a reasonable consistency with industrial data, suggesting that the surrogate models are directly implementable in the glass-manufacturing industry.

Abstract: Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a modular automated virtualization system (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multilayer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.

Abstract: We have witnessed impressive advances in video action understanding. Increased dataset sizes, variability, and computation availability have enabled leaps in performance and task diversification. Current systems can provide coarse- and fine-grained descriptions of video scenes, extract segments corresponding to queries, synthesize unobserved parts of videos, and predict context across multiple modalities. This survey comprehensively reviews advances in uni- and multi-modal action understanding across a range of tasks. We focus on prevalent challenges, overview widely adopted datasets, and survey seminal works with an emphasis on recent advances. We broadly distinguish between three temporal scopes: (1) recognition tasks of actions observed in full, (2) prediction tasks for ongoing partially observed actions, and (3) forecasting tasks for subsequent unobserved action(s). This division allows us to identify specific action modeling and video representation challenges. Finally, we outline future directions to address current shortcomings.

<title>OSMamba: Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba with Dual-Domain Prior Generator for Exposure Correction</title>

Abstract: Exposure correction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and image processing. Recently, frequency domain-based methods have achieved impressive improvement, yet they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios under extreme exposure conditions. This is due to the local convolutional receptive fields failing to model long-range dependencies in the spectrum, and the non-generative learning paradigm being inadequate for retrieving lost details from severely degraded regions. In this paper, we propose Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba (OSMamba), a novel exposure correction network that incorporates the advantages of state space models and generative diffusion models to address these limitations. Specifically, OSMamba introduces an omnidirectional spectral scanning mechanism that adapts Mamba to the frequency domain to capture comprehensive long-range dependencies in both the amplitude and phase spectra of deep image features, hence enhancing illumination correction and structure recovery. Furthermore, we develop a dual-domain prior generator that learns from well-exposed images to generate a degradation-free diffusion prior containing correct information about severely under- and over-exposed regions for better detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple-exposure and mixed-exposure datasets demonstrate that the proposed OSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Because imitation learning relies on human demonstrations in hard-to-simulate settings, the inclusion of force control in this method has resulted in a shortage of training data, even with a simple change in speed. Although the field of data augmentation has addressed the lack of data, conventional methods of data augmentation for robot manipulation are limited to simulation-based methods or downsampling for position control. This paper proposes a novel method of data augmentation that is applicable to force control and preserves the advantages of real-world datasets. We applied teaching-playback at variable speeds as real-world data augmentation to increase both the quantity and quality of environmental reactions at variable speeds. An experiment was conducted on bilateral control-based imitation learning using a method of imitation learning equipped with position-force control. We evaluated the effect of real-world data augmentation on two tasks, pick-and-place and wiping, at variable speeds, each from two human demonstrations at fixed speed. The results showed a maximum 55% increase in success rate from a simple change in speed of real-world reactions and improved accuracy along the duration/frequency command by gathering environmental reactions at variable speeds.

Abstract: In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection.
  In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration:
  (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models.
  To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.

<title>Lilan: A linear latent network approach for real-time solutions of stiff, nonlinear, ordinary differential equations</title>

Abstract: Solving stiff ordinary differential equations (StODEs) requires sophisticated numerical solvers, which are often computationally expensive. In particular, StODE's often cannot be solved with traditional explicit time integration schemes and one must resort to costly implicit methods to compute solutions. On the other hand, state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) based methods such as Neural ODE (NODE) poorly handle the timescale separation of various elements of the solutions to StODEs and require expensive implicit solvers for integration at inference time. In this work, we embark on a different path which involves learning a latent dynamics for StODEs, in which one completely avoids numerical integration. To that end, we consider a constant velocity latent dynamical system whose solution is a sequence of straight lines. Given the initial condition and parameters of the ODE, the encoder networks learn the slope (i.e the constant velocity) and the initial condition for the latent dynamics. In other words, the solution of the original dynamics is encoded into a sequence of straight lines which can be decoded back to retrieve the actual solution as and when required. Another key idea in our approach is a nonlinear transformation of time, which allows for the "stretching/squeezing" of time in the latent space, thereby allowing for varying levels of attention to different temporal regions in the solution. Additionally, we provide a simple universal-approximation-type proof showing that our approach can approximate the solution of stiff nonlinear system on a compact set to any degree of accuracy, {\epsilon}. We show that the dimension of the latent dynamical system in our approach is independent of {\epsilon}. Numerical investigation on prototype StODEs suggest that our method outperforms state-of-the art machine learning approaches for handling StODEs.

Abstract: Investigating NLP through a philosophical lens has recently caught researcher's eyes as it connects computational methods with classical schools of philosophy. This paper introduces a philosophical approach inspired by the \textit{Hegelian Dialectic} for LLMs' \textit{self-reflection}, utilizing a self-dialectical approach to emulate internal critiques and then synthesize new ideas by resolving the opposing points of view. Moreover, this paper investigates the effect of LLMs' temperature for generation by establishing a dynamic annealing approach, which promotes the creativity in the early stages and gradually refines it by focusing on the nuances, as well as a fixed-temperature strategy for generation. We assess the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating novel ideas and in improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs during problem-solving. Moreover, we implement a Multi-Agent Majority Voting (MAMV) strategy to assess the validity and novelty of the generated ideas, which proves useful in the absence of domain experts. Our experiments demonstrate promising results in generating ideas and enhancing problem-solving performance.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty in blackbox learning models, by constructing prediction sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees. Traditional approaches rely on scalar nonconformity scores, which fail to fully exploit the geometric structure of multivariate outputs, such as in multi-output regression or multiclass classification. Recent methods addressing this limitation impose predefined convex shapes for the prediction sets, potentially misaligning with the intrinsic data geometry. We introduce a novel CP procedure handling multivariate score functions through the lens of optimal transport. Specifically, we leverage Monge-Kantorovich vector ranks and quantiles to construct prediction region with flexible, potentially non-convex shapes, better suited to the complex uncertainty patterns encountered in multivariate learning tasks. We prove that our approach ensures finite-sample, distribution-free coverage properties, similar to typical CP methods. We then adapt our method for multi-output regression and multiclass classification, and also propose simple adjustments to generate adaptive prediction regions with asymptotic conditional coverage guarantees. Finally, we evaluate our method on practical regression and classification problems, illustrating its advantages in terms of (conditional) coverage and efficiency.

Abstract: Ab initio based accurate simulation of phonon-assisted optical spectra of semiconductors at finite temperatures remains a formidable challenge, as it requires large supercells for phonon sampling and computationally expensive high-accuracy exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. In this work, we present an efficient approach that combines deep learning tight-binding and potential models to address this challenge with ab initio fidelity. By leveraging molecular dynamics for atomic configuration sampling and deep learning-enabled rapid Hamiltonian evaluation, our approach enables large-scale simulations of temperature-dependent optical properties using advanced XC functionals (HSE, SCAN). Demonstrated on silicon and gallium arsenide across temperature 100-400 K, the method accurately captures phonon-induced bandgap renormalization and indirect/direct absorption processes which are in excellent agreement with experimental findings over five orders of magnitude. This work establishes a pathway for high-throughput investigation of electron-phonon coupled phenomena in complex materials, overcoming traditional computational limitations arising from large supercell used with computationally expensive XC-functionals.

<title>Predicting potentially abusive clauses in Chilean terms of services with natural language processing</title>

Abstract: This study addresses the growing concern of information asymmetry in consumer contracts, exacerbated by the proliferation of online services with complex Terms of Service that are rarely even read. Even though research on automatic analysis methods is conducted, the problem is aggravated by the general focus on English-language Machine Learning approaches and on major jurisdictions, such as the European Union. We introduce a new methodology and a substantial dataset addressing this gap. We propose a novel annotation scheme with four categories and a total of 20 classes, and apply it on 50 online Terms of Service used in Chile. Our evaluation of transformer-based models highlights how factors like language- and/or domain-specific pre-training, few-shot sample size, and model architecture affect the detection and classification of potentially abusive clauses. Results show a large variability in performance for the different tasks and models, with the highest macro-F1 scores for the detection task ranging from 79% to 89% and micro-F1 scores up to 96%, while macro-F1 scores for the classification task range from 60% to 70% and micro-F1 scores from 64% to 80%. Notably, this is the first Spanish-language multi-label classification dataset for legal clauses, applying Chilean law and offering a comprehensive evaluation of Spanish-language models in the legal domain. Our work lays the ground for future research in method development for rarely considered legal analysis and potentially leads to practical applications to support consumers in Chile and Latin America as a whole.

Abstract: Domain randomization in reinforcement learning is an established technique for increasing the robustness of control policies trained in simulation. By randomizing environment properties during training, the learned policy can become robust to uncertainties along the randomized dimensions. While the environment distribution is typically specified by hand, in this paper we investigate automatically discovering a sampling distribution via entropy-regularized reward maximization of a normalizing-flow-based neural sampling distribution. We show that this architecture is more flexible and provides greater robustness than existing approaches that learn simpler, parameterized sampling distributions, as demonstrated in six simulated and one real-world robotics domain. Lastly, we explore how these learned sampling distributions, combined with a privileged value function, can be used for out-of-distribution detection in an uncertainty-aware multi-step manipulation planner.

<title>Taking a Big Step: Large Learning Rates in Denoising Score Matching Prevent Memorization</title>

Abstract: Denoising score matching plays a pivotal role in the performance of diffusion-based generative models. However, the empirical optimal score--the exact solution to the denoising score matching--leads to memorization, where generated samples replicate the training data. Yet, in practice, only a moderate degree of memorization is observed, even without explicit regularization. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by uncovering an implicit regularization mechanism driven by large learning rates. Specifically, we show that in the small-noise regime, the empirical optimal score exhibits high irregularity. We then prove that, when trained by stochastic gradient descent with a large enough learning rate, neural networks cannot stably converge to a local minimum with arbitrarily small excess risk. Consequently, the learned score cannot be arbitrarily close to the empirical optimal score, thereby mitigating memorization. To make the analysis tractable, we consider one-dimensional data and two-layer neural networks. Experiments validate the crucial role of the learning rate in preventing memorization, even beyond the one-dimensional setting.

Abstract: We propose and study a neural operator framework for learning memory- and material microstructure-dependent constitutive laws for heterogeneous materials. We work in the two-scale setting where homogenization theory provides a systematic approach to deriving macroscale constitutive laws, obviating the need to resolve complex microstructure repeatedly. However, the unit cell problems defining these constitutive models are typically not amenable to explicit evaluation. It is therefore of interest to learn constitutive models from data generated by the unit cell problem. Our proposed framework models homogenized constitutive laws with both memory- and microstructure-dependence through the use of Markovian recurrent and Fourier neural operators. The homogenization problem for Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic materials is studied to provide firm theoretical foundations for our model. The theoretical properties of the cell problem in this Kelvin-Voigt setting motivate the proposed learning framework; and are also used to prove a universal approximation theorem for the learned macroscale constitutive model. Numerical experiments show that the proposed learning framework accurately learns memory- and microstructure-dependent viscoelastic and elasto-viscoplastic constitutive models, beyond the setting of the theory. Furthermore, we show that the learned constitutive models can be successfully deployed in macroscale simulation of material deformation for different microstructures without retraining.

Abstract: The advent of Music-Language Models has greatly enhanced the automatic music generation capability of AI systems, but they are also limited in their coverage of the musical genres and cultures of the world. We present a study of the datasets and research papers for music generation and quantify the bias and under-representation of genres. We find that only 5.7% of the total hours of existing music datasets come from non-Western genres, which naturally leads to disparate performance of the models across genres. We then investigate the efficacy of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques in mitigating this bias. Our experiments with two popular models -- MusicGen and Mustango, for two underrepresented non-Western music traditions -- Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music, highlight the promises as well as the non-triviality of cross-genre adaptation of music through small datasets, implying the need for more equitable baseline music-language models that are designed for cross-cultural transfer learning.

Abstract: Hypercomplex image processing extends conventional techniques in a unified paradigm encompassing algebraic and geometric principles. This work leverages quaternions and the two-dimensional orthogonal planes split framework (splitting of a quaternion - representing a pixel - into pairs of orthogonal 2D planes) for natural/biomedical image analysis through the following computational workflows and outcomes: natural/biomedical image re-colorization, natural image de-colorization, natural/biomedical image contrast enhancement, computational re-staining and stain separation in histological images, and performance gains in machine/deep learning pipelines for histological images. The workflows are analyzed separately for natural and biomedical images to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The proposed workflows can regulate color appearance (e.g. with alternative renditions and grayscale conversion) and image contrast, be part of automated image processing pipelines (e.g. isolating stain components, boosting learning models), and assist in digital pathology applications (e.g. enhancing biomarker visibility, enabling colorblind-friendly renditions). Employing only basic arithmetic and matrix operations, this work offers a computationally accessible methodology - in the hypercomplex domain - that showcases versatility and consistency across image processing tasks and a range of computer vision and biomedical applications. The proposed non-data-driven methods achieve comparable or better results (particularly in cases involving well-known methods) to those reported in the literature, showcasing the potential of robust theoretical frameworks with practical effectiveness. Results, methods, and limitations are detailed alongside discussion of promising extensions, emphasizing the potential of feature-rich mathematical/computational frameworks for natural and biomedical images.

arXiv:2502.11331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of data has sparked significant interest in leveraging findings from one study to estimate treatment effects in a different target population without direct outcome observations. However, the transfer learning process is frequently hindered by substantial covariate shift and limited overlap between (i) the source and target populations, as well as (ii) the treatment and control groups within the source. We propose a novel method for overlap-adaptive transfer learning of conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using kernel ridge regression (KRR). Our approach involves partitioning the labeled source data into two subsets. The first one is used to train candidate CATE models based on regression adjustment and pseudo-outcomes. An optimal model is then selected using the second subset and unlabeled target data, employing another pseudo-outcome-based strategy. We provide a theoretical justification for our method through sharp non-asymptotic MSE bounds, highlighting its adaptivity to both weak overlaps and the complexity of CATE function. Extensive numerical studies confirm that our method achieves superior finite-sample efficiency and adaptability. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach using a 401(k) eligibility dataset.

Abstract: Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space modeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by reducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods typically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory state, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive downstream tasks. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, particularly the brain's ability to maintain robust long-term memory while mitigating "memory interference", we introduce a novel architecture called Mixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states, with a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This approach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory interference. As a result, MoM performs exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing linear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory states, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity, allowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while constant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM significantly outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, particularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable to Transformer models. The code is released at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/MoM and is also released as a part of https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.

Abstract: In this paper we present ToMCAT (Theory-of-Mind for Cooperative Agents in Teams), a new framework for generating ToM-conditioned trajectories. It combines a meta-learning mechanism, that performs ToM reasoning over teammates' underlying goals and future behavior, with a multiagent denoising-diffusion model, that generates plans for an agent and its teammates conditioned on both the agent's goals and its teammates' characteristics, as computed via ToM. We implemented an online planning system that dynamically samples new trajectories (replans) from the diffusion model whenever it detects a divergence between a previously generated plan and the current state of the world. We conducted several experiments using ToMCAT in a simulated cooking domain. Our results highlight the importance of the dynamic replanning mechanism in reducing the usage of resources without sacrificing team performance. We also show that recent observations about the world and teammates' behavior collected by an agent over the course of an episode combined with ToM inferences are crucial to generate team-aware plans for dynamic adaptation to teammates, especially when no prior information is provided about them.

Abstract: Planning and control for high-dimensional robot manipulators in cluttered, dynamic environments require both computational efficiency and robust safety guarantees. Inspired by recent advances in learning configuration-space distance functions (CDFs) as robot body representations, we propose a unified framework for motion planning and control that formulates safety constraints as CDF barriers. A CDF barrier approximates the local free configuration space, substantially reducing the number of collision-checking operations during motion planning. However, learning a CDF barrier with a neural network and relying on online sensor observations introduce uncertainties that must be considered during control synthesis. To address this, we develop a distributionally robust CDF barrier formulation for control that explicitly accounts for modeling errors and sensor noise without assuming a known underlying distribution. Simulations and hardware experiments on a 6-DoF xArm manipulator show that our neural CDF barrier formulation enables efficient planning and robust real-time safe control in cluttered and dynamic environments, relying only on onboard point-cloud observations.

Abstract: Measurements are fundamental to knowledge creation in science, enabling consistent sharing of findings and serving as the foundation for scientific discovery. As machine learning systems increasingly transform scientific fields, the question of how to effectively evaluate these systems becomes crucial for ensuring reliable progress.
  In this review, we examine the current state and future directions of evaluation frameworks for machine learning in science. We organize the review around a broadly applicable framework for evaluating machine learning systems through the lens of statistical measurement theory, using materials science as our primary context for examples and case studies. We identify key challenges common across machine learning evaluation such as construct validity, data quality issues, metric design limitations, and benchmark maintenance problems that can lead to phantom progress when evaluation frameworks fail to capture real-world performance needs.
  By examining both traditional benchmarks and emerging evaluation approaches, we demonstrate how evaluation choices fundamentally shape not only our measurements but also research priorities and scientific progress. These findings reveal the critical need for transparency in evaluation design and reporting, leading us to propose evaluation cards as a structured approach to documenting measurement choices and limitations.
  Our work highlights the importance of developing a more diverse toolbox of evaluation techniques for machine learning in materials science, while offering insights that can inform evaluation practices in other scientific domains where similar challenges exist.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification. The standard approach to conformal prediction relies on comparing the ranks of prediction scores: under exchangeability, the rank of a future test point cannot be too extreme relative to a calibration set. This rank-based method can be reformulated in terms of p-values. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach based on e-values, known as conformal e-prediction. E-values offer key advantages that cannot be achieved with p-values, enabling new theoretical and practical capabilities. In particular, we present three applications that leverage the unique strengths of e-values: batch anytime-valid conformal prediction, fixed-size conformal sets with data-dependent coverage, and conformal prediction under ambiguous ground truth. Overall, these examples demonstrate that e-value-based constructions provide a flexible expansion of the toolbox of conformal prediction.

Abstract: Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) is revolutionizing collaboration across domains such as defense, healthcare, and autonomous systems by integrating AI-driven decision-making, trust calibration, and adaptive teaming. This survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy of HMT, analyzing theoretical models, including reinforcement learning, instance-based learning, and interdependence theory, alongside interdisciplinary methodologies. Unlike prior reviews, we examine team cognition, ethical AI, multi-modal interactions, and real-world evaluation frameworks. Key challenges include explainability, role allocation, and scalable benchmarking. We propose future research in cross-domain adaptation, trust-aware AI, and standardized testbeds. By bridging computational and social sciences, this work lays a foundation for resilient, ethical, and scalable HMT systems.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values remains critical yet hindered by four key challenges: (1) scarcity of balanced safety datasets, (2) alignment tax, (3) vulnerability to jailbreak attacks due to shallow alignment, and (4) inability to dynamically adapt rewards according to task difficulty. To address these limitations, we introduce HAIR (Hardness-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Introspective Reasoning), a novel alignment approach inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. Our approach consists of two main components: (1) construction of a balanced safety Chain-of-Draft (CoD) dataset for seven harmful categories using structured prompts that leverage the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs; and (2) training of category-specific reward models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning optimization to task difficulty at both the data and model levels. Comprehensive experiments across four harmlessness and four usefulness benchmarks demonstrate that HAIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all baseline methods in safety while maintaining high levels of usefulness.

<title>Coverage-Guaranteed Speech Emotion Recognition via Calibrated Uncertainty-Adaptive Prediction Sets</title>

Abstract: Road rage, often triggered by emotional suppression and sudden outbursts, significantly threatens road safety by causing collisions and aggressive behavior. Speech emotion recognition technologies can mitigate this risk by identifying negative emotions early and issuing timely alerts. However, current SER methods, such as those based on hidden markov models and Long short-term memory networks, primarily handle one-dimensional signals, frequently experience overfitting, and lack calibration, limiting their safety-critical effectiveness. We propose a novel risk-controlled prediction framework providing statistically rigorous guarantees on prediction accuracy. This approach employs a calibration set to define a binary loss function indicating whether the true label is included in the prediction set. Using a data-driven threshold $\beta$, we optimize a joint loss function to maintain an expected test loss bounded by a user-specified risk level $\alpha$. Evaluations across six baseline models and two benchmark datasets demonstrate our framework consistently achieves a minimum coverage of $1 - \alpha$, effectively controlling marginal error rates despite varying calibration-test split ratios (e.g., 0.1). The robustness and generalizability of the framework are further validated through an extension to small-batch online calibration under a local exchangeability assumption. We construct a non-negative test martingale to maintain prediction validity even in dynamic and non-exchangeable environments. Cross-dataset tests confirm our method's ability to uphold reliable statistical guarantees in realistic, evolving data scenarios.

<title>MARIOH: Multiplicity-Aware Hypergraph Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a powerful framework for modeling higher-order interactions that traditional pairwise graphs cannot fully capture. However, practical constraints often lead to their simplification into projected graphs, resulting in substantial information loss and ambiguity in representing higher-order relationships. In this work, we propose MARIOH, a supervised approach for reconstructing the original hypergraph from its projected graph by leveraging edge multiplicity. To overcome the difficulties posed by the large search space, MARIOH integrates several key ideas: (a) identifying provable size-2 hyperedges, which reduces the candidate search space, (b) predicting the likelihood of candidates being hyperedges by utilizing both structural and multiplicity-related features, and (c) not only targeting promising hyperedge candidates but also examining less confident ones to explore alternative possibilities. Together, these ideas enable MARIOH to efficiently and effectively explore the search space. In our experiments using 10 real-world datasets, MARIOH achieves up to 74.51% higher reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Catch Me if You Search: When Contextual Web Search Results Affect the Detection of Hallucinations</title>

Abstract: While we increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, these models are known to produce inaccurate content or `hallucinations' with potentially disastrous consequences. The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions. We highlighted practical implications of incorporating web search functionality into LLMs in real-world contexts.

<title>IRA: Adaptive Interest-aware Representation and Alignment for Personalized Multi-interest Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17529</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.17529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this, we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences, ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.

<title>Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Quality Shifts on Video Streaming Over 5G</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17938</link>

Abstract: The Quality of Experience (QoE) is the users satisfaction while streaming a video session over an over-the-top (OTT) platform like YouTube. QoE of YouTube reflects the smooth streaming session without any buffering and quality shift events. One of the most important factors nowadays affecting QoE of YouTube is frequent shifts from higher to lower resolutions and vice versa. These shifts ensure a smooth streaming session; however, it might get a lower mean opinion score. For instance, dropping from 1080p to 480p during a video can preserve continuity but might reduce the viewers enjoyment. Over time, OTT platforms are looking for alternative ways to boost user experience instead of relying on traditional Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as bandwidth, latency, and throughput. As a result, we look into the relationship between quality shifting in YouTube streaming sessions and the channel metrics RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. Our findings state that these channel metrics positively correlate with shifts. Thus, in real-time, OTT can only rely on them to predict video streaming sessions into lower- and higher-resolution categories, thus providing more resources to improve user experience. Using traditional Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, we achieved an accuracy of 77-percent, while using only RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. In the era of 5G and beyond, where ultra-reliable, low-latency networks promise enhanced streaming capabilities, the proposed methodology can be used to improve OTT services.

Abstract: Straight line equation $y=mx$ with slope $m$, when singularly perturbed as $ay^3+y=mx$ with a positive parameter $a$, results in S-shaped curves or S-curves on a real plane. As $a\rightarrow 0$, we get back $y=mx$ which is a cumulative distribution function of a continuous uniform distribution that describes the occurrence of every event in an interval to be equally probable. As $a\rightarrow\infty$, the derivative of $y$ has finite support only at $y=0$ resembling a degenerate distribution. Based on these arguments, in this work, we propose that these S-curves can represent maximum entropy uniform distribution to a zero entropy single value. We also argue that these S-curves are superposable as they are only parametrically nonlinear but fundamentally linear. So far, the superposed forms have been used to capture the patterns of natural systems such as nonlinear dynamics of biological growth and kinetics of enzyme reactions. Here, we attempt to use the S-curve and its superposed form as statistical models. We fit the models on a classical dataset containing flower measurements of iris plants and analyze their usefulness in pattern recognition. Based on these models, we claim that any non-uniform pattern can be represented as a singular perturbation to uniform distribution. However, our parametric estimation procedure have some limitations such as sensitivity to initial conditions depending on the data at hand.

Abstract: The main goal of this article is to convince you, the reader, that supervised learning in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model is closely related to -- of all things -- bipartite matching! En-route from PAC learning to bipartite matching, I will overview a particular transductive model of learning, and associated one-inclusion graphs, which can be viewed as a generalization of some of the hat puzzles that are popular in recreational mathematics. Whereas this transductive model is far from new, it has recently seen a resurgence of interest as a tool for tackling deep questions in learning theory. A secondary purpose of this article could be as a (biased) tutorial on the connections between the PAC and transductive models of learning.

Summary:<br />
Reduced order models (ROMs) are essential in fluid mechanics for cost-effective predictions. This study introduces a novel nonlinear reduction strategy tailored for transient flows, incorporating parametrisation and uncertainty quantification through a variational auto-encoder (VAE) using variational inference for confidence measurement. By utilizing a latent space transformer with attention mechanisms, the model can predict dynamical systems with enhanced generalization capabilities across diverse dynamics. The integration of confidence metrics enables informed decision-making and robust model performance, facilitating more efficient sampling of the parameter space to improve predictions across the entire range without complete evaluation data. This approach aims to address the challenges of nonlinear reduction techniques in transient environments, advancing the applicability and reliability of ROMs in engineering applications.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2503.23236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) play a critical role in fluid mechanics by providing low-cost predictions, making them an attractive tool for engineering applications. However, for ROMs to be widely applicable, they must not only generalise well across different regimes, but also provide a measure of confidence in their predictions. While recent data-driven approaches have begun to address nonlinear reduction techniques to improve predictions in transient environments, challenges remain in terms of robustness and parametrisation. In this work, we present a nonlinear reduction strategy specifically designed for transient flows that incorporates parametrisation and uncertainty quantification. Our reduction strategy features a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that uses variational inference for confidence measurement. We use a latent space transformer that incorporates recent advances in attention mechanisms to predict dynamical systems. Attention's versatility in learning sequences and capturing their dependence on external parameters enhances generalisation across a wide range of dynamics. Prediction, coupled with confidence, enables more informed decision making and addresses the need for more robust models. In addition, this confidence is used to cost-effectively sample the parameter space, improving model performance a priori across the entire parameter space without requiring evaluation data for the entire domain.

Abstract: Recent research on graph neural networks (GNNs) has explored mechanisms for capturing local uncertainty and exploiting graph hierarchies to mitigate data sparsity and leverage structural properties. However, the synergistic integration of these two approaches remains underexplored. This work introduces a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Network (HU-GNN), which unifies multi-scale representation learning, principled uncertainty estimation, and self-supervised embedding diversity within a single end-to-end framework. Specifically, HU-GNN adaptively forms node clusters and estimates uncertainty at multiple structural scales from individual nodes to higher levels. These uncertainty estimates guide a robust message-passing mechanism and attention weighting, effectively mitigating noise and adversarial perturbations while preserving predictive accuracy on semi-supervised classification tasks. We also offer key theoretical contributions, including a probabilistic formulation, rigorous uncertainty-calibration guarantees, and formal robustness bounds. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art robustness and interpretability.

This paper introduces a novel approach to visual storytelling by leveraging transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models on the Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset. The proposed VIST-GPT model generates visually grounded and contextually appropriate narratives. Traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr are deemed insufficient for this task, so the authors introduce RoViST and GROOVIST metrics to better assess visual storytelling quality in terms of visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These reference-free metrics offer a more comprehensive evaluation that closely aligns with human judgment. Overall, the paper presents a cutting-edge method for enhancing the quality and evaluation of narratives in the field of visual storytelling.

Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task. Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

Abstract: Concatenating matrices is a common technique for uncovering shared structures in data through singular value decomposition (SVD) and low-rank approximations. However, a fundamental question arises: how does the singular value spectrum of the concatenated matrix relate to the spectra of its individual components? In this work, we develop a perturbation framework that extends classical results such as Weyl's inequality to concatenated matrices. We establish analytical bounds that quantify the stability of singular values under small perturbations in the submatrices. Our results show that if the matrices being concatenated are close in norm, the dominant singular values of the concatenated matrix remain stable, enabling controlled trade-offs between accuracy and compression. These insights provide a theoretical foundation for improved matrix clustering and compression strategies, with applications in numerical linear algebra, signal processing, and data-driven modeling.

Abstract: Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data. This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy. Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to arbitrary magnifications.

Abstract: Integrating human expertise with machine learning is crucial for applications demanding high accuracy and safety, such as autonomous driving. This study introduces Interactive Double Deep Q-network (iDDQN), a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach that enhances Reinforcement Learning (RL) by merging human insights directly into the RL training process, improving model performance. Our proposed iDDQN method modifies the Q-value update equation to integrate human and agent actions, establishing a collaborative approach for policy development. Additionally, we present an offline evaluative framework that simulates the agent's trajectory as if no human intervention had occurred, to assess the effectiveness of human interventions. Empirical results in simulated autonomous driving scenarios demonstrate that iDDQN outperforms established approaches, including Behavioral Cloning (BC), HG-DAgger, Deep Q-Learning from Demonstrations (DQfD), and vanilla DRL in leveraging human expertise for improving performance and adaptability.

Summary:
This study explores the use of machine learning models in predicting the quality characteristics of products in the injection moulding process. It highlights the importance of explainable AI methods in providing insights into the root causes of deviations in product properties. The research demonstrates the existence of interactions among input machine settings and compares various model-agnostic explainability methods to analyze feature impacts. The study shows that different explainability methods can lead to different feature attributions, which in turn affect the accuracy of cause identification in injection moulding. By performing explanations on both random forest and multilayer perceptron models, the study aims to provide actionable insights for improving the quality control process. Overall, the findings emphasize the significance of using explainable AI for accurate root cause analysis and quality control in injection moulding processes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a product deviates from its desired properties in the injection moulding process, its root cause analysis can be aided by models that relate the input machine settings with the output quality characteristics. The machine learning models tested in the quality prediction are mostly black boxes; therefore, no direct explanation of their prognosis is given, which restricts their applicability in the quality control. The previously attempted explainability methods are either restricted to tree-based algorithms only or do not emphasize on the fact that some explainability methods can lead to wrong root cause identification of a product's deviation from its desired properties. This study first shows that the interactions among the multiple input machine settings do exist in real experimental data collected as per a central composite design. Then, the model-agnostic explainable AI methods are compared for the first time to show that different explainability methods indeed lead to different feature impact analysis in injection moulding. Moreover, it is shown that the better feature attribution translates to the correct cause identification and actionable insights for the injection moulding process. Being model agnostic, explanations on both random forest and multilayer perceptron are performed for the cause analysis, as both models have the mean absolute percentage error of less than 0.05% on the experimental dataset.

<div> Keywords: Audio-visual segmentation, OpenAVS, multimedia foundation models, self-training, unsupervised learning

Summary: 
OpenAVS introduces a novel language-based approach for Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) that aligns audio and visual modalities using text as a proxy. By leveraging multimedia foundation models, OpenAVS infers masks through audio-to-text prompt generation, LLM-guided prompt translation, and text-to-visual sounding object segmentation. The architecture is designed to transfer knowledge effectively to the downstream AVS task and can be integrated with any supervised AVS model using OpenAVS-ST, a model-agnostic framework that enables self-training with pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that OpenAVS outperforms existing unsupervised, zero-shot, and few-shot AVS methods, achieving significant performance gains in challenging scenarios. The approach demonstrates superior performance in mIoU and F-score metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in open-vocabulary audio-visual segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation aims to separate sounding objects from videos by predicting pixel-level masks based on audio signals. Existing methods primarily concentrate on closed-set scenarios and direct audio-visual alignment and fusion, which limits their capability to generalize to new, unseen situations. In this paper, we propose OpenAVS, a novel training-free language-based approach that, for the first time, effectively aligns audio and visual modalities using text as a proxy for open-vocabulary Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS). Equipped with multimedia foundation models, OpenAVS directly infers masks through 1) audio-to-text prompt generation, 2) LLM-guided prompt translation, and 3) text-to-visual sounding object segmentation. The objective of OpenAVS is to establish a simple yet flexible architecture that relies on the most appropriate foundation models by fully leveraging their capabilities to enable more effective knowledge transfer to the downstream AVS task. Moreover, we present a model-agnostic framework OpenAVS-ST that enables the integration of OpenAVS with any advanced supervised AVS model via pseudo-label based self-training. This approach enhances performance by effectively utilizing large-scale unlabeled data when available. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of OpenAVS. It surpasses existing unsupervised, zero-shot, and few-shot AVS methods by a significant margin, achieving absolute performance gains of approximately 9.4% and 10.9% in mIoU and F-score, respectively, in challenging scenarios.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) use various adaptation strategies to achieve high performance in tasks. However, selecting the optimal model and strategy within resource constraints is challenging. The study proposes COSMOS, a prediction framework that accurately estimates adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. It includes embedding-augmented lightweight proxy models for fine-tuning performance prediction and low-sample scaling laws for retrieval-augmented in-context learning forecast. Evaluation on eight benchmarks shows COSMOS achieves high prediction accuracy and reduces computational costs by up to 98.71%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72% on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while maintaining performance standards.

Summary:
In this study, the focus is on the increasing automation of traffic management systems, which are vulnerable to cyberattacks that disrupt urban mobility and public safety. Traditional network-layer defenses are often not accessible to transportation agencies, leading to the development of a machine learning-based approach that relies solely on traffic flow data. The researchers simulate cyberattacks in a virtualized traffic network environment and develop a deep learning-based anomaly detection system to identify compromised signals, with Longest Stop Duration and Total Jam Distance being identified as key indicators. The use of Explainable AI techniques helps in interpreting critical decision factors and diagnosing misclassification errors. Two primary challenges are identified: transitional data inconsistencies and model limitations that can lead to stealth attacks evading detection, particularly in low-traffic conditions. This work aims to enhance AI-driven traffic security by improving detection accuracy and trustworthiness in smart transportation systems.

Abstract: The increasing automation of traffic management systems has made them prime targets for cyberattacks, disrupting urban mobility and public safety. Traditional network-layer defenses are often inaccessible to transportation agencies, necessitating a machine learning-based approach that relies solely on traffic flow data. In this study, we simulate cyberattacks in a semi-realistic environment, using a virtualized traffic network to analyze disruption patterns. We develop a deep learning-based anomaly detection system, demonstrating that Longest Stop Duration and Total Jam Distance are key indicators of compromised signals. To enhance interpretability, we apply Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, identifying critical decision factors and diagnosing misclassification errors. Our analysis reveals two primary challenges: transitional data inconsistencies, where mislabeled recovery-phase traffic misleads the model, and model limitations, where stealth attacks in low-traffic conditions evade detection. This work enhances AI-driven traffic security, improving both detection accuracy and trustworthiness in smart transportation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents our simulation of cyber-attacks and detection strategies on the traffic control system in Daytona Beach, FL. using Raspberry Pi virtual machines and the OPNSense firewall, along with traffic dynamics from SUMO and exploitation via the Metasploit framework. We try to answer the research questions: are we able to identify cyber attacks by only analyzing traffic flow patterns. In this research, the cyber attacks are focused particularly when lights are randomly turned all green or red at busy intersections by adversarial attackers. Despite challenges stemming from imbalanced data and overlapping traffic patterns, our best model shows 85\% accuracy when detecting intrusions purely using traffic flow statistics. Key indicators for successful detection included occupancy, jam length, and halting durations.

Abstract: We propose a refined approach to efficiently fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on specific domains like the mathematical domain by employing a budgeted subset selection method. Our approach combines utility and diversity metrics to select the most informative and representative training examples. The final goal is to achieve near-full dataset performance with meticulously selected data points from the entire dataset while significantly reducing computational cost and training time and achieving competitive performance as the full dataset. The utility metric incorporates both perplexity and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) loss to identify challenging examples that contribute most to model learning, while the diversity metric ensures broad coverage across mathematical subdomains. We evaluate our method on LLaMA-3 8B and Phi-3 models, comparing against several baseline approaches, including random selection, diversity-based sampling, and existing state-of-the-art subset selection techniques.

<div> contexture theory, representation learning methods, singular functions, model scaling, context evaluation

Summary: The paper introduces the concept of the contexture theory, which characterizes representation learning as learning from the association between input and a context variable. It shows that popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of the expectation operator induced by the context. The theory applies to various learning paradigms such as supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning, and shows that representations learning the contexture are optimal for tasks compatible with the context. The theory suggests that further scaling up model size yields diminishing returns once it approximates the top singular functions. It emphasizes the need for better contexts for further improvement. The paper also proposes a metric to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowledge of downstream tasks, showing a correlation with encoder performance on real datasets. <div>

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of foundation models, we do not have a systematic characterization of the representations that these models learn. In this paper, we establish the contexture theory. It shows that a large class of representation learning methods can be characterized as learning from the association between the input and a context variable. Specifically, we show that many popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of the expectation operator induced by the context, in which case we say that the representation learns the contexture. We demonstrate the generality of the contexture theory by proving that representation learning within various learning paradigms -- supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning -- can all be studied from such a perspective. We also prove that the representations that learn the contexture are optimal on those tasks that are compatible with the context. One important implication of the contexture theory is that once the model is large enough to approximate the top singular functions, further scaling up the model size yields diminishing returns. Therefore, scaling is not all we need, and further improvement requires better contexts. To this end, we study how to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowing the downstream tasks. We propose a metric and show by experiments that it correlates well with the actual performance of the encoder on many real datasets.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges of adapting to non-stationary network conditions and the limitations of current solutions based on stationary assumptions. It highlights the problem of neural networks suffering from plasticity loss, affecting their ability to adapt to evolving network conditions. The Silent Neuron theory is introduced as a comprehensive framework to understand plasticity degradation. The Reset Silent Neuron (ReSiN) approach is proposed to address this limitation by strategically resetting neurons based on forward and backward propagation states. In an adaptive video streaming system implementation, ReSiN demonstrated significant improvements over existing solutions, achieving higher bitrate and better quality of experience while maintaining smoothness. The solution also performs well in stationary environments, showcasing robust adaptability across different network conditions. <div>

Abstract: Adapting to non-stationary network conditions presents significant challenges for resource adaptation. However, current solutions primarily rely on stationary assumptions. While data-driven reinforcement learning approaches offer promising solutions for handling network dynamics, our systematic investigation reveals a critical limitation: neural networks suffer from plasticity loss, significantly impeding their ability to adapt to evolving network conditions. Through theoretical analysis of neural propagation mechanisms, we demonstrate that existing dormant neuron metrics inadequately characterize neural plasticity loss. To address this limitation, we have developed the Silent Neuron theory, which provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding plasticity degradation. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose the Reset Silent Neuron (ReSiN), which preserves neural plasticity through strategic neuron resets guided by both forward and backward propagation states. In our implementation of an adaptive video streaming system, ReSiN has shown significant improvements over existing solutions, achieving up to 168% higher bitrate and 108% better quality of experience (QoE) while maintaining comparable smoothness. Furthermore, ReSiN consistently outperforms in stationary environments, demonstrating its robust adaptability across different network conditions.

Summary: 
The paper focuses on the development of Machine Learning (ML) models for house price prediction and investigates the presence of ethnic and racial bias in these models. Through a combination of structural and neighborhood-level attributes, ML models are developed and assessed for bias towards protected attributes such as race and ethnicity. The study finds varying levels of bias in the ML-driven house price prediction models and explores different bias mitigation solutions. The experimental results show that in-processing bias mitigation approaches tend to be more effective than pre-processing methods in addressing bias in this problem domain. The research highlights the importance of ethical considerations in ML-driven solutions for improving housing conditions and promoting social equity. The code for the study is available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: As a basic human need, housing plays a key role in enhancing health, well-being, and educational outcome in society, and the housing market is a major factor for promoting quality of life and ensuring social equity. To improve the housing conditions, there has been extensive research on building Machine Learning (ML)-driven house price prediction solutions to accurately forecast the future conditions, and help inform actions and policies in the field. In spite of their success in developing high-accuracy models, there is a gap in our understanding of the extent to which various ML-driven house price prediction approaches show ethnic and/or racial bias, which in turn is essential for the responsible use of ML, and ensuring that the ML-driven solutions do not exacerbate inequity. To fill this gap, this paper develops several ML models from a combination of structural and neighborhood-level attributes, and conducts comprehensive assessments on the fairness of ML models under various definitions of privileged groups. As a result, it finds that the ML-driven house price prediction models show various levels of bias towards protected attributes (i.e., race and ethnicity in this study). Then, it investigates the performance of different bias mitigation solutions, and the experimental results show their various levels of effectiveness on different ML-driven methods. However, in general, the in-processing bias mitigation approach tends to be more effective than the pre-processing one in this problem domain.

Summary: 
The study explores the compute efficiency of LLM training with different parameterizations, focusing on the transfer of optimal hyperparameters across changes in model depth. Some parameterizations struggle with transferring base hyperparameters, leading to suboptimal training or costly re-tuning. Additionally, certain parameterizations may result in lazy learning, restricting the depth and nonlinearity of layers. The proposed parameterization, CompleteP, achieves depth-wise hyperparameter transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers. This approach allows for improved compute efficiency, enabling a wider range of model width/depth ratios for various hardware and operational contexts. CompleteP delivers 12-34% efficiency gains compared to existing methods. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compute efficiency of LLM training when using different parameterizations, i.e., rules for adjusting model and optimizer hyperparameters (HPs) as model size changes. Some parameterizations fail to transfer optimal base HPs (such as learning rate) across changes in model depth, requiring practitioners to either re-tune these HPs as they scale up (expensive), or accept sub-optimal training when re-tuning is prohibitive. Even when they achieve HP transfer, we develop theory to show parameterizations may still exist in the lazy learning regime where layers learn only features close to their linearization, preventing effective use of depth and nonlinearity. Finally, we identify and adopt the unique parameterization we call CompleteP that achieves both depth-wise HP transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers. CompleteP enables a wider range of model width/depth ratios to remain compute-efficient, unlocking shapes better suited for different hardware settings and operational contexts. Moreover, CompleteP enables 12-34\% compute efficiency improvements over the prior state-of-the-art.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a Safe Skill Planning (SSkP) approach for enhancing safe reinforcement learning (RL) by utilizing offline demonstration data. The SSkP method consists of two stages: first, a skill risk predictor is learned using PU learning from the offline data, and second, a risk planning process is employed to improve online safe RL by learning a risk-averse policy while adapting the skill risk predictor to the environment. Experimental results in various robotic simulation environments show that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art safe RL methods consistently. The SSkP approach effectively combines offline data with online interactions to learn a safe policy and mitigate risks, demonstrating the potential for enhancing safe RL in real-world applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure safety when an RL agent conducts learning by interacting with real-world environments where improper actions can induce high costs or lead to severe consequences. In this paper, we propose a novel Safe Skill Planning (SSkP) approach to enhance effective safe RL by exploiting auxiliary offline demonstration data. SSkP involves a two-stage process. First, we employ PU learning to learn a skill risk predictor from the offline demonstration data. Then, based on the learned skill risk predictor, we develop a novel risk planning process to enhance online safe RL and learn a risk-averse safe policy efficiently through interactions with the online RL environment, while simultaneously adapting the skill risk predictor to the environment. We conduct experiments in several benchmark robotic simulation environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art safe RL methods.

<div> Keywords: conceptual design phase, functional modeling, Function-Behavior-Structure framework, Large Language Models, domain adaptation<br />
Summary: <br />
The article discusses the importance of the conceptual design phase in product development, where designers generate solutions based on functional requirements. Functional modeling, particularly using the Function-Behavior-Structure framework, helps translate functional intent into behavioral and structural descriptions. However, the lack of comprehensive functional data often hinders effective design decision-making. The study proposes a new approach using Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT architectures, for automated classification of mechanical assembly parts' functions. By fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets, the accuracy and consistency of function annotation can be improved. A case study showcasing fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on the Oregon State Design Repository data demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. The domain-adapted LLM helps generate high-quality functional data, enhancing the representation of mechanical parts and supporting more effective design exploration in early-phase engineering. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conceptual design phase represents a critical early stage in the product development process, where designers generate potential solutions that meet predefined design specifications based on functional requirements. Functional modeling, a foundational aspect of this phase, enables designers to reason about product functions before specific structural details are determined. A widely adopted approach to functional modeling is the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework, which supports the transformation of functional intent into behavioral and structural descriptions. However, the effectiveness of function-based design is often hindered by the lack of well-structured and comprehensive functional data. This scarcity can negatively impact early design decision-making and hinder the development of accurate behavioral models. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as those based on GPT architectures, offer a promising avenue to address this gap. LLMs have demonstrated significant capabilities in language understanding and natural language processing (NLP), making them suitable for automated classification tasks. This study proposes a novel LLM-based domain adaptation (DA) framework using fine-tuning for the automated classification of mechanical assembly parts' functions. By fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets, the traditionally manual and subjective process of function annotation can be improved in both accuracy and consistency. A case study demonstrates fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on data from the Oregon State Design Repository (OSDR), and evaluation on the A Big CAD (ABC) dataset shows that the domain-adapted LLM can generate high-quality functional data, enhancing the semantic representation of mechanical parts and supporting more effective design exploration in early-phase engineering.

Summary: This paper introduces a novel approach to fair machine learning by addressing biases in predictions on graph data. It focuses on non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) settings, where data instances are interconnected in social networks. By leveraging the Network Structural Causal Model (NSCM) framework and two key assumptions, Decomposability and Graph Independence, the Message Passing Variational Autoencoder for Causal Inference (MPVA) is developed to compute interventional distributions and enable causally fair node classification. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets show that MPVA outperforms existing methods by effectively mitigating bias. The study highlights the potential of causality-based fairness in complex machine learning applications and suggests further research into relaxing initial assumptions to enhance model fairness. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Fair machine learning seeks to identify and mitigate biases in predictions against unfavorable populations characterized by demographic attributes, such as race and gender. Recently, a few works have extended fairness to graph data, such as social networks, but most of them neglect the causal relationships among data instances. This paper addresses the prevalent challenge in fairness-aware ML algorithms, which typically assume Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data. We tackle the overlooked domain of non-IID, graph-based settings where data instances are interconnected, influencing the outcomes of fairness interventions. We base our research on the Network Structural Causal Model (NSCM) framework and posit two main assumptions: Decomposability and Graph Independence, which enable the computation of interventional distributions in non-IID settings using the $do$-calculus. Based on that, we develop the Message Passing Variational Autoencoder for Causal Inference (MPVA) to compute interventional distributions and facilitate causally fair node classification through estimated interventional distributions. Empirical evaluations on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MPVA outperforms conventional methods by effectively approximating interventional distributions and mitigating bias. The implications of our findings underscore the potential of causality-based fairness in complex ML applications, setting the stage for further research into relaxing the initial assumptions to enhance model fairness.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Focal-SAM as a method to address the challenges posed by long-tailed distributions in real-world datasets. It aims to improve generalization by flattening the loss landscape, offering fine-grained control without the need for multiple backpropagations like existing methods ImbSAM and CC-SAM. Focal-SAM assigns different penalties to class-wise sharpness, striking a balance between computational efficiency and control over the loss landscape. The method is theoretically analyzed for its generalization ability and a sharper generalization bound is derived. Extensive experiments on various models confirm the effectiveness of Focal-SAM in improving generalization to tail classes. <div>

Abstract: Real-world datasets often follow a long-tailed distribution, making generalization to tail classes difficult. Recent methods resorted to long-tail variants of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), such as ImbSAM and CC-SAM, to improve generalization by flattening the loss landscape. However, these attempts face a trade-off between computational efficiency and control over the loss landscape. On the one hand, ImbSAM is efficient but offers only coarse control as it excludes head classes from the SAM process. On the other hand, CC-SAM provides fine-grained control through class-dependent perturbations but at the cost of efficiency due to multiple backpropagations. Seeing this dilemma, we introduce Focal-SAM, which assigns different penalties to class-wise sharpness, achieving fine-grained control without extra backpropagations, thus maintaining efficiency. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze Focal-SAM's generalization ability and derive a sharper generalization bound. Extensive experiments on both traditional and foundation models validate the effectiveness of Focal-SAM.

<div> Curriculum learning, Adaptively point-weighting, deep networks, training strategy, training effectiveness <br />
Summary: 
The study introduces the Adaptively Point-Weighting (APW) curriculum learning algorithm for training deep networks. APW assigns weights to training samples based on their training error and the network's current state. It prioritizes easy samples in the early training phase to capture overall characteristics quickly and switches to hard samples later for improved fitting performance. The algorithm's properties, including training effectiveness, feasibility, stability, and generalization performance, are theoretically analyzed and validated through numerical experiments. APW demonstrates superiority in training deep networks, supported by empirical evidence and theoretical findings. <div>

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) is referred to as a training strategy that makes easy samples learned first and then fits hard samples. It imitates the process of humans learning knowledge, and has become a potential manner of effectively training deep networks. In this study, we develop the adaptively point-weighting (APW) curriculum learning algorithm, which adaptively assigns the weight to every training sample not only based on its training error but also considering the current training state of the network. Specifically, in the early training phase, it increases the weights of easy samples to make the network rapidly capture the overall characteristics of the dataset; and in the later training phase, the weights of hard points rise to improve the fitting performance on the discrete local regions. Moreover, we also present the theoretical analysis on the properties of APW including training effectiveness, training feasibility, training stability, and generalization performance. The numerical experiments support the superiority of APW and demonstrate the validity of our theoretical findings.

Summary: 
The article introduces PoseX, an open-source benchmark for protein-ligand docking evaluation through self-docking and cross-docking scenarios. The benchmark includes a curated dataset with entries for both self-docking and cross-docking, incorporating 22 docking methods across different categories. The authors designed a post-processing relaxation method to refine binding poses and released a real-time leaderboard for model ranking. Insights from extensive experiments show that AI-based approaches have surpassed traditional physics-based methods in docking accuracy, with AI methods showing improved generalization. The post-processing relaxation significantly alleviates stereochemical deficiencies in AI-based methods. Combining AI docking methods with relaxation achieves optimal performance. However, AI co-folding methods face challenges with ligand chirality issues not resolved by relaxation. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>
arXiv:2505.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in protein-ligand docking, especially in modern deep learning methods, and some benchmarks were proposed, e.g., PoseBench, Plinder. However, these benchmarks suffer from less practical evaluation setups (e.g., blind docking, self docking), or heavy framework that involves training, raising challenges to assess docking methods efficiently. To fill this gap, we proposed PoseX, an open-source benchmark focusing on self-docking and cross-docking, to evaluate the algorithmic advances practically and comprehensively. Specifically, first, we curate a new evaluation dataset with 718 entries for self docking and 1,312 for cross docking; second, we incorporate 22 docking methods across three methodological categories, including (1) traditional physics-based methods (e.g., Schr\"odinger Glide), (2) AI docking methods (e.g., DiffDock), (3) AI co-folding methods (e.g., AlphaFold3); third, we design a relaxation method as post-processing to minimize conformation energy and refine binding pose; fourth, we released a leaderboard to rank submitted models in real time. We draw some key insights via extensive experiments: (1) AI-based approaches have already surpassed traditional physics-based approaches in overall docking accuracy (RMSD). The longstanding generalization issues that have plagued AI molecular docking have been significantly alleviated in the latest models. (2) The stereochemical deficiencies of AI-based approaches can be greatly alleviated with post-processing relaxation. Combining AI docking methods with the enhanced relaxation method achieves the best performance to date. (3) AI co-folding methods commonly face ligand chirality issues, which cannot be resolved by relaxation. The code, curated dataset and leaderboard are released at https://github.com/CataAI/PoseX.

Summary: <br />
The article presents a new approach called Physics-encoded Spectral Attention Network (PeSANet) for accurately modeling and forecasting complex systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional numerical methods often struggle with incomplete or unknown physical laws, while machine learning approaches face challenges with limited data. PeSANet integrates local and global information using a physics-encoded block to approximate local differential operators and a spectral-enhanced block to capture global dependencies in the frequency domain. A novel spectral attention mechanism is introduced to model inter-spectrum relationships and learn long-range spatial features.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and forecasting complex systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is crucial in various scientific and engineering domains. However, traditional numerical methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to incomplete or unknown physical laws. Meanwhile, machine learning approaches often fail to generalize effectively when faced with scarce observational data and the challenge of capturing local and global features. To this end, we propose the Physics-encoded Spectral Attention Network (PeSANet), which integrates local and global information to forecast complex systems with limited data and incomplete physical priors. The model consists of two key components: a physics-encoded block that uses hard constraints to approximate local differential operators from limited data, and a spectral-enhanced block that captures long-range global dependencies in the frequency domain. Specifically, we introduce a novel spectral attention mechanism to model inter-spectrum relationships and learn long-range spatial features. Experimental results demonstrate that PeSANet outperforms existing methods across all metrics, particularly in long-term forecasting accuracy, providing a promising solution for simulating complex systems with limited data and incomplete physics.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel framework called VLoRP, which extends low-rank gradient projection by allowing for control over the trade-off between memory efficiency and performance through projection granularity. The finer-grained projections offered by VLoRP enhance stability and efficiency even within a fixed memory constraint.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of projection granularity in enhancing memory efficiency and performance in gradient projection methods. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the success of low-rank adapter (LoRA), low-rank gradient projection (LoRP) has emerged as a promising solution for memory-efficient fine-tuning. However, existing LoRP methods typically treat each row of the gradient matrix as the default projection unit, leaving the role of projection granularity underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel framework, VLoRP, that extends low-rank gradient projection by introducing an additional degree of freedom for controlling the trade-off between memory efficiency and performance, beyond the rank hyper-parameter. Through this framework, we systematically explore the impact of projection granularity, demonstrating that finer-grained projections lead to enhanced stability and efficiency even under a fixed memory budget. Regarding the optimization for VLoRP, we present ProjFactor, an adaptive memory-efficient optimizer, that significantly reduces memory requirement while ensuring competitive performance, even in the presence of gradient accumulation. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of VLoRP, demonstrating the descent and convergence of its optimization trajectory under both SGD and ProjFactor. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our findings, covering tasks such as commonsense reasoning, MMLU, and GSM8K.

Abstract: Online anomaly detection is essential in fields such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and industrial monitoring, where promptly identifying deviations from expected behavior can avert critical failures or security breaches. While numerous anomaly scoring methods based on supervised or unsupervised learning have been proposed, current approaches typically rely on a continuous stream of real-world calibration data to provide assumption-free guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR). To address the inherent challenges posed by limited real calibration data, we introduce context-aware prediction-powered conformal online anomaly detection (C-PP-COAD). Our framework strategically leverages synthetic calibration data to mitigate data scarcity, while adaptively integrating real data based on contextual cues. C-PP-COAD utilizes conformal p-values, active p-value statistics, and online FDR control mechanisms to maintain rigorous and reliable anomaly detection performance over time. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that C-PP-COAD significantly reduces dependency on real calibration data without compromising guaranteed FDR control.

Abstract: With the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, high-precision indoor positioning has become essential for Location-Based Services (LBS) in complex indoor environments. Fingerprint-based localization is popular, but traditional algorithms and deep learning-based methods face challenges such as poor generalization, overfitting, and lack of interpretability. This paper applies conformal prediction (CP) to deep learning-based indoor positioning. CP transforms the uncertainty of the model into a non-conformity score, constructs prediction sets to ensure correctness coverage, and provides statistical guarantees. We also introduce conformal risk control for path navigation tasks to manage the false discovery rate (FDR) and the false negative rate (FNR).The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 100% on the training dataset and 85% on the testing dataset, effectively demonstrating its performance and generalization capability. Furthermore, we also develop a conformal p-value framework to control the proportion of position-error points. Experiments on the UJIIndoLoc dataset using lightweight models such as MobileNetV1, VGG19, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and EfficientNet show that the conformal prediction technique can effectively approximate the target coverage, and different models have different performance in terms of prediction set size and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific modeling, particularly for complex dynamical systems; however, accurately capturing age-structured population dynamics under policy-driven fertility changes remains a significant challenge due to the lack of effective integration between domain knowledge and long-term temporal dependencies. To address this issue, we propose two physics-informed deep learning frameworks--PINN and LSTM-PINN--that incorporate policy-aware fertility functions into a transport-reaction partial differential equation to simulate population evolution from 2024 to 2054. The standard PINN model enforces the governing equation and boundary conditions via collocation-based training, enabling accurate learning of underlying population dynamics and ensuring stable convergence. Building on this, the LSTM-PINN framework integrates sequential memory mechanisms to effectively capture long-range dependencies in the age-time domain, achieving robust training performance across multiple loss components. Simulation results under three distinct fertility policy scenarios-the Three-child policy, the Universal two-child policy, and the Separate two-child policy--demonstrate the models' ability to reflect policy-sensitive demographic shifts and highlight the effectiveness of integrating domain knowledge into data-driven forecasting. This study provides a novel and extensible framework for modeling age-structured population dynamics under policy interventions, offering valuable insights for data-informed demographic forecasting and long-term policy planning in the face of emerging population challenges.

Abstract: Conditional decision generation with diffusion models has shown powerful competitiveness in reinforcement learning (RL). Recent studies reveal the relation between energy-function-guidance diffusion models and constrained RL problems. The main challenge lies in estimating the intermediate energy, which is intractable due to the log-expectation formulation during the generation process. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Energy-guided Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, we first provide a theoretical analysis and the closed-form solution of the intermediate guidance when the diffusion model obeys the conditional Gaussian transformation. Then, we analyze the posterior Gaussian distribution in the log-expectation formulation and obtain the target estimation of the log-expectation under mild assumptions. Finally, we train an intermediate energy neural network to approach the target estimation of log-expectation formulation. We apply our method in 30+ offline RL tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method surpasses numerous representative baselines in D4RL offline reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Summary:
CafCor presents a solution for trustworthy distributed learning that ensures resilience against malicious parties while maintaining data privacy. The algorithm relies on shared randomness between pairs of workers to achieve strong privacy-utility trade-offs without the need for a trusted central server. By integrating robust gradient aggregation with correlated noise injection, CafCor outperforms local differential privacy methods and approaches the utility of central differential privacy. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the practicality of CafCor, showcasing that privacy and robustness can coexist in distributed systems without compromising utility or requiring trust in the server. <div>
arXiv:2505.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience against malicious parties and data privacy are essential for trustworthy distributed learning, yet achieving both with good utility typically requires the strong assumption of a trusted central server. This paper shows that a significantly weaker assumption suffices: each pair of workers shares a randomness seed unknown to others. In a setting where malicious workers may collude with an untrusted server, we propose CafCor, an algorithm that integrates robust gradient aggregation with correlated noise injection, leveraging shared randomness between workers. We prove that CafCor achieves strong privacy-utility trade-offs, significantly outperforming local differential privacy (DP) methods, which do not make any trust assumption, while approaching central DP utility, where the server is fully trusted. Empirical results on standard benchmarks validate CafCor's practicality, showing that privacy and robustness can coexist in distributed systems without sacrificing utility or trusting the server.

Summary: 
OODTE is a utility designed to assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer by utilizing a differential testing approach on a variety of ONNX models. Through this process, 15 issues were detected, with 14 being previously unknown, highlighting problems such as optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. Notably, 9.2% of models experienced issues leading to optimizer crashes or invalid model generation using primary optimization strategies. Furthermore, discrepancies in model accuracy were observed in 30% of classification models, and to a lesser extent in semantic segmentation and object detection models as well. The iterative approach taken by OODTE helped localize the root causes of accuracy differences, providing valuable insights into the performance of the ONNX Optimizer. <div>
arXiv:2505.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With $700$ stars on GitHub and part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer consists of the standard method to apply graph-based optimizations on ONNX models. However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15 issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies. In addition, $30$% of the classification models presented accuracy differences across the original and the optimized model variants, while $16.6$% of semantic segmentation and object detection models are also affected, at least to a limited extent.

The method alternates between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance training stability. Unlike previous approaches relying on heuristics or manually annotated data, LookAlike leverages its own inconsistencies for scalable and stable training. Evaluation on a dataset of over 1,400 math MCQs shows that LookAlike achieves 51.6% accuracy in distractor generation and 57.2% in error generation, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of preference-based regularization and inconsistency mining for generating consistent math MCQ distractors at scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate distractors for multiple-choice questions (MCQs), especially in domains like math education. However, existing approaches are limited in ensuring that the generated distractors are consistent with common student errors. We propose LookAlike, a method that improves error-distractor consistency via preference optimization. Our two main innovations are: (a) mining synthetic preference pairs from model inconsistencies, and (b) alternating supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to stabilize training. Unlike prior work that relies on heuristics or manually annotated preference data, LookAlike uses its own generation inconsistencies as dispreferred samples, thus enabling scalable and stable training. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 1,400+ math MCQs, LookAlike achieves 51.6% accuracy in distractor generation and 57.2% in error generation under LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, outperforming an existing state-of-the-art method (45.6% / 47.7%). These improvements highlight the effectiveness of preference-based regularization and inconsistency mining for generating consistent math MCQ distractors at scale.

Summary: 
Advances in deep learning and generative modeling have sparked interest in data-driven molecule discovery pipelines. The study introduces BOOM, a benchmark for out-of-distribution molecular property predictions. Despite the need for accurate OOD predictions in molecule discovery, current ML models struggle to generalize OOD. More than 140 model-property combinations were evaluated, with no existing models achieving strong OOD generalization. Models with high inductive bias excel in specific OOD tasks, while foundation models lack OOD extrapolation capabilities. Ablation experiments demonstrate the impact of various factors on OOD performance. Developing ML models with robust OOD generalization presents a new challenge in chemical ML model development. The open-source benchmark will be available on Github. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Advances in deep learning and generative modeling have driven interest in data-driven molecule discovery pipelines, whereby machine learning (ML) models are used to filter and design novel molecules without requiring prohibitively expensive first-principles simulations. Although the discovery of novel molecules that extend the boundaries of known chemistry requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, ML models often struggle to generalize OOD. Furthermore, there are currently no systematic benchmarks for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present BOOM, $\boldsymbol{b}$enchmarks for $\boldsymbol{o}$ut-$\boldsymbol{o}$f-distribution $\boldsymbol{m}$olecular property predictions -- a benchmark study of property-based out-of-distribution models for common molecular property prediction models. We evaluate more than 140 combinations of models and property prediction tasks to benchmark deep learning models on their OOD performance. Overall, we do not find any existing models that achieve strong OOD generalization across all tasks: even the top performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x larger than in-distribution. We find that deep learning models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. Although chemical foundation models with transfer and in-context learning offer a promising solution for limited training data scenarios, we find that current foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation capabilities. We perform extensive ablation experiments to highlight how OOD performance is impacted by data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation. We propose that developing ML models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML model development. This open-source benchmark will be made available on Github.

Summary:
- Explored regression and machine learning techniques for timely U.S. unemployment forecasts.
- Compared seven models including linear regression, tree-based ensembles, and LSTM network.
- Tuned hyperparameters, evaluated performance, and assessed ability to predict unemployment direction.
- Tree-based ensembles and CatBoost outperformed linear approaches, while LSTM captured temporal patterns effectively.

arXiv:2505.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I explored how a range of regression and machine learning techniques can be applied to monthly U.S. unemployment data to produce timely forecasts. I compared seven models: Linear Regression, SGDRegressor, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Support Vector Regression, and an LSTM network, training each on a historical span of data and then evaluating on a later hold-out period. Input features include macro indicators (GDP growth, CPI), labor market measures (job openings, initial claims), financial variables (interest rates, equity indices), and consumer sentiment.
  I tuned model hyperparameters via cross-validation and assessed performance with standard error metrics and the ability to predict the correct unemployment direction. Across the board, tree-based ensembles (and CatBoost in particular) deliver noticeably better forecasts than simple linear approaches, while the LSTM captures underlying temporal patterns more effectively than other nonlinear methods. SVR and SGDRegressor yield modest gains over standard regression but don't match the consistency of the ensemble and deep-learning models.
  Interpretability tools ,feature importance rankings and SHAP values, point to job openings and consumer sentiment as the most influential predictors across all methods. By directly comparing linear, ensemble, and deep-learning approaches on the same dataset, our study shows how modern machine-learning techniques can enhance real-time unemployment forecasting, offering economists and policymakers richer insights into labor market trends.
  In the comparative evaluation of the models, I employed a dataset comprising thirty distinct features over the period from January 2020 through December 2024.

Summary:
The article introduces a new method, Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL), for accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine spatial resolutions. By utilizing a multi-task learning framework, the MSGL method combines coarse-scale graph learning with fine-scale graph learning to improve prediction accuracy. The method also introduces cross-scale interpolation learning to establish connections across different spatial scales, enhancing overall model performance. Additionally, the Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL) breaks away from synchronous training approaches. Through extensive experiments in the Delaware River Basin, USA, the MSGL method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in downscaling daily stream temperatures, showcasing its potential for water resources monitoring and management. <div>

Abstract: Water temperature can vary substantially even across short distances within the same sub-watershed. Accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine spatial resolutions (i.e., fine scales, $\leq$ 1 km) enables precise interventions to maintain water quality and protect aquatic habitats. Although spatiotemporal models have made substantial progress in spatially coarse time series modeling, challenges persist in predicting at fine spatial scales due to the lack of data at that scale.To address the problem of insufficient fine-scale data, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL) method. This method employs a multi-task learning framework where coarse-scale graph learning, bolstered by larger datasets, simultaneously enhances fine-scale graph learning. Although existing multi-scale or multi-resolution methods integrate data from different spatial scales, they often overlook the spatial correspondences across graph structures at various scales. To address this, our MSGL introduces an additional learning task, cross-scale interpolation learning, which leverages the hydrological connectedness of stream locations across coarse- and fine-scale graphs to establish cross-scale connections, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Furthermore, we have broken free from the mindset that multi-scale learning is limited to synchronous training by proposing an Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL). Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method for anti-sparse downscaling of daily stream temperatures in the Delaware River Basin, USA, highlighting its potential utility for water resources monitoring and management.

<div> semantic control, LM generations, toxicity, sentiment, politeness

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach for semantic control of language model (LM) generations by leveraging gradient information from a sequence-level verifier. The goal is to steer LM generations towards satisfying non-lexical constraints such as toxicity, sentiment, and politeness. Unlike existing methods that only handle syntactic constraints or rely on ineffective sampling, this approach efficiently reasons over all generated sentences that meet the target attribute. By creating a local LM distribution favoring semantically similar sentences and estimating the probability of satisfying the constraint based on the verifier's evaluation, the method enables precise steering of LM generations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in controlling toxicity, sentiment, and topic adherence of LM generations with a high probability of constraint satisfaction (>95%) while maintaining generation quality. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic control entails steering LM generations towards satisfying subtle non-lexical constraints, e.g., toxicity, sentiment, or politeness, attributes that can be captured by a sequence-level verifier. It can thus be viewed as sampling from the LM distribution conditioned on the target attribute, a computationally intractable problem due to the non-decomposable nature of the verifier. Existing approaches to LM control either only deal with syntactic constraints which cannot capture the aforementioned attributes, or rely on sampling to explore the conditional LM distribution, an ineffective estimator for low-probability events. In this work, we leverage a verifier's gradient information to efficiently reason over all generations that satisfy the target attribute, enabling precise steering of LM generations by reweighing the next-token distribution. Starting from an initial sample, we create a local LM distribution favoring semantically similar sentences. This approximation enables the tractable computation of an expected sentence embedding. We use this expected embedding, informed by the verifier's evaluation at the initial sample, to estimate the probability of satisfying the constraint, which directly informs the update to the next-token distribution. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach in controlling the toxicity, sentiment, and topic-adherence of LMs yielding generations satisfying the constraint with high probability (>95%) without degrading their quality.

Summary:  
EnsembleCI is introduced as an adaptive, ensemble learning-based approach for carbon intensity (CI) forecasting, aiming to improve upon the limitations of the current state-of-the-art method, CarbonCast. The new approach addresses regional variability and adaptability issues, offering enhanced flexibility in CI predictions. In evaluations across 11 regional grids, EnsembleCI outperformed CarbonCast by achieving lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and improving prediction accuracy by an average of 19.58%. Despite some variability across grids due to regional diversity, EnsembleCI demonstrated greater robustness in long-term forecasting. The approach also identified region-specific key features, highlighting its interpretability and practical relevance. The availability of EnsembleCI source code and data provides transparency and reproducibility for further research and industry applications. <div>

Abstract: Carbon intensity (CI) measures the average carbon emissions generated per unit of electricity, making it a crucial metric for quantifying and managing the environmental impact. Accurate CI predictions are vital for minimizing carbon footprints, yet the state-of-the-art method (CarbonCast) falls short due to its inability to address regional variability and lack of adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce EnsembleCI, an adaptive, end-to-end ensemble learning-based approach for CI forecasting. EnsembleCI combines weighted predictions from multiple sublearners, offering enhanced flexibility and regional adaptability. In evaluations across 11 regional grids, EnsembleCI consistently surpasses CarbonCast, achieving the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in almost all grids and improving prediction accuracy by an average of 19.58%. While performance still varies across grids due to inherent regional diversity, EnsembleCI reduces variability and exhibits greater robustness in long-term forecasting compared to CarbonCast and identifies region-specific key features, underscoring its interpretability and practical relevance. These findings position EnsembleCI as a more accurate and reliable solution for CI forecasting. EnsembleCI source code and data used in this paper are available at https://github.com/emmayly/EnsembleCI.

Summary: <br />
The proposed D3HRL approach addresses challenges in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning by modeling delayed effects as causal relationships and using distributed causal discovery to learn them. It employs conditional independence testing to eliminate spurious correlations and constructs hierarchical policies based on identified causal relationships. Through iterative execution, D3HRL explores the complete causal chain of tasks and demonstrates sensitivity to delay effects. Experimental results in 2D-MineCraft and MiniGrid environments show that D3HRL accurately identifies causal relationships, leading to reliable decision-making in complex scenarios. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) algorithms excel in long-horizon sequential decision-making tasks but still face two challenges: delay effects and spurious correlations. To address them, we propose a causal HRL approach called D3HRL. First, D3HRL models delayed effects as causal relationships across different time spans and employs distributed causal discovery to learn these relationships. Second, it employs conditional independence testing to eliminate spurious correlations. Finally, D3HRL constructs and trains hierarchical policies based on the identified true causal relationships. These three steps are iteratively executed, gradually exploring the complete causal chain of the task. Experiments conducted in 2D-MineCraft and MiniGrid show that D3HRL demonstrates superior sensitivity to delay effects and accurately identifies causal relationships, leading to reliable decision-making in complex environments.

<div> skip connections, self-attention, Vision Transformers, Token Graying, deep architectures <br />
Summary:
The study focuses on the critical role of skip connections in training modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). It notes that self-attention in ViTs requires skip connections for successful training, unlike other components of ViTs. This dependency on skip connections is a recent development, as previous deep architectures like CNNs have performed well without them. The paper theorizes that the self-attention mechanism is inherently unstable and relies on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, the study introduces Token Graying as a simple yet effective method to improve input token conditions. The effectiveness of Token Graying is validated in both supervised and self-supervised training approaches. Overall, the research sheds light on the unique relationship between skip connections, self-attention, and the training of Vision Transformers. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.

<div> alignment, Large Language Models, calibration, preference, fine-tuning

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on preference alignment but suffer from poor calibration post-alignment. The issue stems from preference collapse, leading to overconfidence and calibration problems in LLMs. Fine-tuning with domain-specific knowledge helps mitigate overconfidence. Models fall into calibratable and non-calibratable regimes based on Expected Calibration Error (ECE) bounds. In the calibratable regime, calibration-aware fine-tuning maintains proper calibration without performance loss. However, as models aim for better performance, they may become non-calibratable, requiring an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization during fine-tuning to manage calibration error. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of these strategies in enhancing calibration in LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key technologies for the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) is preference alignment. However, a notable side effect of preference alignment is poor calibration: while the pre-trained models are typically well-calibrated, LLMs tend to become poorly calibrated after alignment with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment affects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we observe that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes to the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor calibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with domain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further analyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into two regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a calibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without compromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for better performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we develop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to maintain low calibration error. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

arXiv:2505.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide & Deep, a simple yet effective learning architecture for recommendation systems developed by Google, has had a significant impact in both academia and industry due to its combination of the memorization ability of generalized linear models and the generalization ability of deep models. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) remain dominant in node classification tasks; however, recent studies have highlighted issues such as heterophily and expressiveness, which focus on graph structure while seemingly neglecting the potential role of node features. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework GCNIII, which leverages the Wide & Deep architecture and incorporates three techniques: Intersect memory, Initial residual and Identity mapping. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that GCNIII can more effectively balance the trade-off between over-fitting and over-generalization on various semi- and full- supervised tasks. Additionally, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for node feature engineering to enhance the performance of GCNIII in cross-domain node classification tasks.

Results show that antibody language models perform well in antigen-related tasks, but struggle with regression tasks like thermostability and affinity.

Abstract: Nanobodies, single-domain antibody fragments derived from camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies, exhibit unique advantages such as compact size, high stability, and strong binding affinity, making them valuable tools in therapeutics and diagnostics. While recent advances in pretrained protein and antibody language models (PPLMs and PALMs) have greatly enhanced biomolecular understanding, nanobody-specific modeling remains underexplored and lacks a unified benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce NbBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for nanobody representation learning. Spanning eight biologically meaningful tasks across nine curated datasets, NbBench encompasses structure annotation, binding prediction, and developability assessment. We systematically evaluate eleven representative models--including general-purpose protein LMs, antibody-specific LMs, and nanobody-specific LMs--in a frozen setting. Our analysis reveals that antibody language models excel in antigen-related tasks, while performance on regression tasks such as thermostability and affinity remains challenging across all models. Notably, no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. By standardizing datasets, task definitions, and evaluation protocols, NbBench offers a reproducible foundation for assessing and advancing nanobody modeling.

Abstract: Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models to novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has gained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly, Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction. Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally, we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%. Our code is released at https://github.com/karin0018/GraphPrompter.

Abstract: DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous measurement of expression levels of thousands of genes, thereby facilitating the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as brain tumors and the identification of diagnostic genetic signatures. To derive meaningful biological insights from the high-dimensional and complex gene features obtained through this technology and to analyze gene properties in detail, classical AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning are widely employed. However, these methods face various limitations in managing high-dimensional vector spaces and modeling the intricate relationships among genes. In particular, challenges such as hyperparameter tuning, computational costs, and high processing power requirements can hinder their efficiency. To overcome these limitations, quantum computing and quantum AI approaches are gaining increasing attention. Leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, quantum methods enable more efficient parallel processing of high-dimensional data and offer faster and more effective solutions to problems that are computationally demanding for classical methods. In this study, a novel model called "Deep VQC" is proposed, based on the Variational Quantum Classifier approach. Developed using microarray data containing 54,676 gene features, the model successfully classified four different types of brain tumors-ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma-alongside healthy samples with high accuracy. Furthermore, compared to classical ML algorithms, our model demonstrated either superior or comparable classification performance. These results highlight the potential of quantum AI methods as an effective and promising approach for the analysis and classification of complex structures such as brain tumors based on gene expression features.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on neural logistic bandits, aiming to learn an unknown reward function using a neural network within a logistic link function. Existing methods have limitations related to variance and feature dimension dependency. The introduction of a novel Bernstein-type inequality for self-normalized vector-valued martingales enables the derivation of a regret upper bound that grows with the effective dimension rather than the feature dimension. Two proposed algorithms, NeuralLog-UCB-1 and NeuralLog-UCB-2, offer improved regret upper bounds compared to previous approaches. These algorithms guarantee regret upper bounds of order $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{\kappa T})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{T/\kappa})$, respectively. Numerical results on synthetic and real datasets validate the theoretical findings. <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of neural logistic bandits, where the main task is to learn an unknown reward function within a logistic link function using a neural network. Existing approaches either exhibit unfavorable dependencies on $\kappa$, where $1/\kappa$ represents the minimum variance of reward distributions, or suffer from direct dependence on the feature dimension $d$, which can be huge in neural network-based settings. In this work, we introduce a novel Bernstein-type inequality for self-normalized vector-valued martingales that is designed to bypass a direct dependence on the ambient dimension. This lets us deduce a regret upper bound that grows with the effective dimension $\widetilde{d}$, not the feature dimension, while keeping a minimal dependence on $\kappa$. Based on the concentration inequality, we propose two algorithms, NeuralLog-UCB-1 and NeuralLog-UCB-2, that guarantee regret upper bounds of order $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{\kappa T})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{T/\kappa})$, respectively, improving on the existing results. Lastly, we report numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.

Summary:  
- The paper introduces five data augmentation-based defense methods for time series classification to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks.  
- These methods are tailored for time series data and offer better defense performance than techniques like adversarial training (AT) while requiring only a small increase in computational resources.  
- By combining these methods into an ensemble, the model not only achieves superior defense performance compared to PGD-based AT but also improves generalization ability.  
- The ensemble method requires less computational resources than PGD-based AT, making it a more efficient alternative for robust TSC models.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As time series classification (TSC) gains prominence, ensuring robust TSC models against adversarial attacks is crucial. While adversarial defense is well-studied in Computer Vision (CV), the TSC field has primarily relied on adversarial training (AT), which is computationally expensive. In this paper, five data augmentation-based defense methods tailored for time series are developed, with the most computationally intensive method among them increasing the computational resources by only 14.07% compared to the original TSC model. Moreover, the deployment process for these methods is straightforward. By leveraging these advantages of our methods, we create two combined methods. One of these methods is an ensemble of all the proposed techniques, which not only provides better defense performance than PGD-based AT but also enhances the generalization ability of TSC models. Moreover, the computational resources required for our ensemble are less than one-third of those required for PGD-based AT. These methods advance robust TSC in data mining. Furthermore, as foundation models are increasingly explored for time series feature learning, our work provides insights into integrating data augmentation-based adversarial defense with large-scale pre-trained models in future research.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of world modeling for agents interacting with the physical world and the necessity of learning causal representations. The research focuses on assessing the ability of State Space Model (SSM) architecture in causal discovery compared to Transformer models. Empirical results indicate that SSMs can effectively model environment dynamics and learn causal models simultaneously, potentially outperforming Transformers in certain scenarios. The study opens up opportunities for further exploration into enhancing SSMs with causal awareness, highlighting the advantages of SSMs in capturing causality in world modeling tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.02074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World modelling, i.e. building a representation of the rules that govern the world so as to predict its evolution, is an essential ability for any agent interacting with the physical world. Despite their impressive performance, many solutions fail to learn a causal representation of the environment they are trying to model, which would be necessary to gain a deep enough understanding of the world to perform complex tasks. With this work, we aim to broaden the research in the intersection of causality theory and neural world modelling by assessing the potential for causal discovery of the State Space Model (SSM) architecture, which has been shown to have several advantages over the widespread Transformer. We show empirically that, compared to an equivalent Transformer, a SSM can model the dynamics of a simple environment and learn a causal model at the same time with equivalent or better performance, thus paving the way for further experiments that lean into the strength of SSMs and further enhance them with causal awareness.

<br />Summary: 
The article addresses challenges in Reinforcement Learning from Interaction Demonstration (RLID) due to noisy and sparse demonstration data by introducing data augmentation techniques. The two techniques presented are the Stitched Trajectory Graph (STG) for discovering transitions between demonstration skills and the State Transition Field (STF) for connecting arbitrary states within the demonstration neighborhood. An Adaptive Trajectory Sampling (ATS) strategy is developed for curriculum generation and a historical encoding mechanism is introduced for memory-dependent skill learning. These enhancements enable more robust skill acquisition that generalizes beyond the demonstrated skills. Extensive experiments across different interaction tasks show significant improvements in convergence stability, generalization capability, and recovery robustness compared to existing methods. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We address a fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning from Interaction Demonstration (RLID): demonstration noise and coverage limitations. While existing data collection approaches provide valuable interaction demonstrations, they often yield sparse, disconnected, and noisy trajectories that fail to capture the full spectrum of possible skill variations and transitions. Our key insight is that despite noisy and sparse demonstrations, there exist infinite physically feasible trajectories that naturally bridge between demonstrated skills or emerge from their neighboring states, forming a continuous space of possible skill variations and transitions. Building upon this insight, we present two data augmentation techniques: a Stitched Trajectory Graph (STG) that discovers potential transitions between demonstration skills, and a State Transition Field (STF) that establishes unique connections for arbitrary states within the demonstration neighborhood. To enable effective RLID with augmented data, we develop an Adaptive Trajectory Sampling (ATS) strategy for dynamic curriculum generation and a historical encoding mechanism for memory-dependent skill learning. Our approach enables robust skill acquisition that significantly generalizes beyond the reference demonstrations. Extensive experiments across diverse interaction tasks demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence stability, generalization capability, and recovery robustness.

Abstract: Representation learning has become an effective technique utilized by electronic design automation (EDA) algorithms, which leverage the natural representation of workflow elements as images, grids, and graphs. By addressing challenges related to the increasing complexity of circuits and stringent power, performance, and area (PPA) requirements, representation learning facilitates the automatic extraction of meaningful features from complex data formats, including images, grids, and graphs. This paper examines the application of representation learning in EDA, covering foundational concepts and analyzing prior work and case studies on tasks that include timing prediction, routability analysis, and automated placement. Key techniques, including image-based methods, graph-based approaches, and hybrid multimodal solutions, are presented to illustrate the improvements provided in routing, timing, and parasitic prediction. The provided advancements demonstrate the potential of representation learning to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in current integrated circuit design flows.

<title>GRAIL: Graph Edit Distance and Node Alignment Using LLM-Generated Code</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02124</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a widely used metric for measuring similarity between two graphs. Computing the optimal GED is NP-hard, leading to the development of various neural and non-neural heuristics. While neural methods have achieved improved approximation quality compared to non-neural approaches, they face significant challenges: (1) They require large amounts of ground truth data, which is itself NP-hard to compute. (2) They operate as black boxes, offering limited interpretability. (3) They lack cross-domain generalization, necessitating expensive retraining for each new dataset. We address these limitations with GRAIL, introducing a paradigm shift in this domain. Instead of training a neural model to predict GED, GRAIL employs a novel combination of large language models (LLMs) and automated prompt tuning to generate a program that is used to compute GED. This shift from predicting GED to generating programs imparts various advantages, including end-to-end interpretability and an autonomous self-evolutionary learning mechanism without ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments on seven datasets confirm that GRAIL not only surpasses state-of-the-art GED approximation methods in prediction quality but also achieves robust cross-domain generalization across diverse graph distributions.

<title>Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Calibrated Language Models with Privileged Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) endeavors to predict future observations given historical data, playing a crucial role in time series data management systems. With advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent studies employ textual prompt tuning to infuse the knowledge of LLMs into MTSF. However, the deployment of LLMs often suffers from low efficiency during the inference phase. To address this problem, we introduce TimeKD, an efficient MTSF framework that leverages the calibrated language models and privileged knowledge distillation. TimeKD aims to generate high-quality future representations from the proposed cross-modality teacher model and cultivate an effective student model. The cross-modality teacher model adopts calibrated language models (CLMs) with ground truth prompts, motivated by the paradigm of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). In addition, we design a subtractive cross attention (SCA) mechanism to refine these representations. To cultivate an effective student model, we propose an innovative privileged knowledge distillation (PKD) mechanism including correlation and feature distillation. PKD enables the student to replicate the teacher's behavior while minimizing their output discrepancy. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed TimeKD.

Abstract: Herb classification presents a critical challenge in botanical research, particularly in regions with rich biodiversity such as Nepal. This study introduces a novel deep learning approach for classifying 60 different herb species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques. Using a manually curated dataset of 12,000 herb images, we developed a robust machine learning model that addresses existing limitations in herb recognition methodologies. Our research employed multiple model architectures, including DenseNet121, 50-layer Residual Network (ResNet50), 16-layer Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG16), InceptionV3, EfficientNetV2, and Vision Transformer (VIT), with DenseNet121 ultimately demonstrating superior performance. Data augmentation and regularization techniques were applied to mitigate overfitting and enhance the generalizability of the model. This work advances herb classification techniques, preserving traditional botanical knowledge and promoting sustainable herb utilization.

<title>Efficient FPGA Implementation of Time-Domain Popcount for Low-Complexity Machine Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02181</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Population count (popcount) is a crucial operation for many low-complexity machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Tsetlin Machine (TM)-a promising new ML method, particularly well-suited for solving classification tasks. The inference mechanism in TM consists of propositional logic-based structures within each class, followed by a majority voting scheme, which makes the classification decision. In TM, the voters are the outputs of Boolean clauses. The voting mechanism comprises two operations: popcount for each class and determining the class with the maximum vote by means of an argmax operation.
  While TMs offer a lightweight ML alternative, their performance is often limited by the high computational cost of popcount and comparison required to produce the argmax result. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to accelerate and optimize these operations by performing them in the time domain. Our time-domain implementation uses programmable delay lines (PDLs) and arbiters to efficiently manage these tasks through delay-based mechanisms. We also present an FPGA design flow for practical implementation of the time-domain popcount, addressing delay skew and ensuring that the behavior matches that of the model's intended functionality. By leveraging the natural compatibility of the proposed popcount with asynchronous architectures, we demonstrate significant improvements in an asynchronous TM, including up to 38% reduction in latency, 43.1% reduction in dynamic power, and 15% savings in resource utilization, compared to synchronous TMs using adder-based popcount.

<title>DNAZEN: Enhanced Gene Sequence Representations via Mixed Granularities of Coding Units</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genome modeling conventionally treats gene sequence as a language, reflecting its structured motifs and long-range dependencies analogous to linguistic units and organization principles such as words and syntax. Recent studies utilize advanced neural networks, ranging from convolutional and recurrent models to Transformer-based models, to capture contextual information of gene sequence, with the primary goal of obtaining effective gene sequence representations and thus enhance the models' understanding of various running gene samples. However, these approaches often directly apply language modeling techniques to gene sequences and do not fully consider the intrinsic information organization in them, where they do not consider how units at different granularities contribute to representation. In this paper, we propose DNAZEN, an enhanced genomic representation framework designed to learn from various granularities in gene sequences, including small polymers and G-grams that are combinations of several contiguous polymers. Specifically, we extract the G-grams from large-scale genomic corpora through an unsupervised approach to construct the G-gram vocabulary, which is used to provide G-grams in the learning process of DNA sequences through dynamically matching from running gene samples. A Transformer-based G-gram encoder is also proposed and the matched G-grams are fed into it to compute their representations and integrated into the encoder for basic unit (E4BU), which is responsible for encoding small units and maintaining the learning and inference process. To further enhance the learning process, we propose whole G-gram masking to train DNAZEN, where the model largely favors the selection of each entire G-gram to mask rather than an ordinary masking mechanism performed on basic units. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DNAZEN on various downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability, a form of complete counterfactual identifiability within the Pearl Causal Hierarchy (PCH) framework, ensuring that all Structural Causal Models (SCMs) satisfying the given assumptions provide consistent answers to all causal questions. To simplify this problem, we introduce exogenous isomorphism and propose $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability, reflecting the strength of model identifiability required for $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability. We explore sufficient assumptions for achieving $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability in two special classes of SCMs: Bijective SCMs (BSCMs), based on counterfactual transport, and Triangular Monotonic SCMs (TM-SCMs), which extend $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_2}$-identifiability. Our results unify and generalize existing theories, providing theoretical guarantees for practical applications. Finally, we leverage neural TM-SCMs to address the consistency problem in counterfactual reasoning, with experiments validating both the effectiveness of our method and the correctness of the theory.

Abstract: The Qwen series has emerged as a leading family of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding tasks. With the recent release of Qwen3, which exhibits superior performance across diverse benchmarks, there is growing interest in deploying these models efficiently in resource-constrained environments. Low-bit quantization presents a promising solution, yet its impact on Qwen3's performance remains underexplored. This study conducts a systematic evaluation of Qwen3's robustness under various quantization settings, aiming to uncover both opportunities and challenges in compressing this state-of-the-art model. We rigorously assess 5 existing classic post-training quantization techniques applied to Qwen3, spanning bit-widths from 1 to 8 bits, and evaluate their effectiveness across multiple datasets. Our findings reveal that while Qwen3 maintains competitive performance at moderate bit-widths, it experiences notable degradation in linguistic tasks under ultra-low precision, underscoring the persistent hurdles in LLM compression. These results emphasize the need for further research to mitigate performance loss in extreme quantization scenarios. We anticipate that this empirical analysis will provide actionable insights for advancing quantization methods tailored to Qwen3 and future LLMs, ultimately enhancing their practicality without compromising accuracy. Our project is released on https://github.com/Efficient-ML/Qwen3-Quantization and https://huggingface.co/collections/Efficient-ML/qwen3-quantization-68164450decb1c868788cb2b.

Abstract: We demonstrate that Muon, the simplest instantiation of a second-order optimizer, explicitly expands the Pareto frontier over AdamW on the compute-time tradeoff. We find that Muon is more effective than AdamW in retaining data efficiency at large batch sizes, far beyond the so-called critical batch size, while remaining computationally efficient, thus enabling more economical training. We study the combination of Muon and the maximal update parameterization (muP) for efficient hyperparameter transfer and present a simple telescoping algorithm that accounts for all sources of error in muP while introducing only a modest overhead in resources. We validate our findings through extensive experiments with model sizes up to four billion parameters and ablations on the data distribution and architecture.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare, by enabling agents to learn complex behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, existing IL methods often face instability challenges, particularly when relying on adversarial reward or value formulations in world model frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that addresses these limitations through a reward model based on random network distillation (RND) for density estimation. Our reward model is built on the joint estimation of expert and behavioral distributions within the latent space of the world model. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, including DMControl, Meta-World, and ManiSkill2, showcasing its ability to deliver stable performance and achieve expert-level results in both locomotion and manipulation tasks. Our approach demonstrates improved stability over adversarial methods while maintaining expert-level performance.

Abstract: Federated causal inference enables multi-site treatment effect estimation without sharing individual-level data, offering a privacy-preserving solution for real-world evidence generation. However, data heterogeneity across sites, manifested in differences in covariate, treatment, and outcome, poses significant challenges for unbiased and efficient estimation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review and theoretical analysis of federated causal effect estimation across both binary/continuous and time-to-event outcomes. We classify existing methods into weight-based strategies and optimization-based frameworks and further discuss extensions including personalized models, peer-to-peer communication, and model decomposition. For time-to-event outcomes, we examine federated Cox and Aalen-Johansen models, deriving asymptotic bias and variance under heterogeneity. Our analysis reveals that FedProx-style regularization achieves near-optimal bias-variance trade-offs compared to naive averaging and meta-analysis. We review related software tools and conclude by outlining opportunities, challenges, and future directions for scalable, fair, and trustworthy federated causal inference in distributed healthcare systems.

Abstract: 3D Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as transformative tools for modeling molecular data. Despite their predictive power, these models often suffer from limited interpretability, raising concerns for scientific applications that require reliable and transparent insights. While existing methods have primarily focused on explaining molecular substructures in 2D GNNs, the transition to 3D GNNs introduces unique challenges, such as handling the implicit dense edge structures created by a cut-off radius. To tackle this, we introduce a novel explanation method specifically designed for 3D GNNs, which localizes the explanation to the immediate neighborhood of each node within the 3D space. Each node is assigned an radius of influence, defining the localized region within which message passing captures spatial and structural interactions crucial for the model's predictions. This method leverages the spatial and geometric characteristics inherent in 3D graphs. By constraining the subgraph to a localized radius of influence, the approach not only enhances interpretability but also aligns with the physical and structural dependencies typical of 3D graph applications, such as molecular learning.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is pivotal in machine learning, especially for classification tasks, as it improves the robustness and reliability of models. We introduce a novel `Epistemic Wrapping' methodology aimed at improving uncertainty estimation in classification. Our approach uses Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) as a baseline and transforms their outputs into belief function posteriors, effectively capturing epistemic uncertainty and offering an efficient and general methodology for uncertainty quantification. Comprehensive experiments employing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) baseline and an Interval Neural Network for inference on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our Epistemic Wrapper significantly enhances generalisation and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: We establish a continuous-time framework for analyzing Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) via stochastic control and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). Considering a continuous-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) driven by a square-integrable martingale, we analyze DQN approximation properties. We show that DQNs can approximate the optimal Q-function on compact sets with arbitrary accuracy and high probability, leveraging residual network approximation theorems and large deviation bounds for the state-action process. We then analyze the convergence of a general Q-learning algorithm for training DQNs in this setting, adapting stochastic approximation theorems. Our analysis emphasizes the interplay between DQN layer count, time discretization, and the role of viscosity solutions (primarily for the value function $V^*$) in addressing potential non-smoothness of the optimal Q-function. This work bridges deep reinforcement learning and stochastic control, offering insights into DQNs in continuous-time settings, relevant for applications with physical systems or high-frequency data.

<title>Entropy-Guided Sampling of Flat Modes in Discrete Spaces</title>

Abstract: Sampling from flat modes in discrete spaces is a crucial yet underexplored problem. Flat modes represent robust solutions and have broad applications in combinatorial optimization and discrete generative modeling. However, existing sampling algorithms often overlook the mode volume and struggle to capture flat modes effectively. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Entropic Discrete Langevin Proposal} (EDLP), which incorporates local entropy into the sampling process through a continuous auxiliary variable under a joint distribution. The local entropy term guides the discrete sampler toward flat modes with a small overhead. We provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for EDLP in locally log-concave discrete distributions. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms traditional approaches across tasks that require sampling from flat basins, including Bernoulli distribution, restricted Boltzmann machines, combinatorial optimization, and binary neural networks.

<title>Adaptive Scoring and Thresholding with Human Feedback for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are trained on in-distribution (ID) data but often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs during deployment -- posing serious risks in safety-critical domains. Recent works have focused on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty, with score thresholds typically set based solely on ID data to achieve a target true positive rate (TPR), since OOD data is limited before deployment. However, these TPR-based thresholds leave false positive rates (FPR) uncontrolled, often resulting in high FPRs where OOD points are misclassified as ID. Moreover, fixed scoring functions and thresholds lack the adaptivity needed to handle newly observed, evolving OOD inputs, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that \emph{safely updates both scoring functions and thresholds on the fly} based on real-world OOD inputs. Our method maximizes TPR while strictly controlling FPR at all times, even as the system adapts over time. We provide theoretical guarantees for FPR control under stationary conditions and present extensive empirical evaluations on OpenOOD benchmarks to demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods by achieving higher TPRs while maintaining FPR control.

<title>Enabling Local Neural Operators to perform Equation-Free System-Level Analysis</title>

Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized many areas of artificial intelligence (AI), but their substantial resource requirements limit their deployment on mobile and edge devices. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of techniques for compressing LLMs to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. We examine three primary approaches: Knowledge Distillation, Model Quantization, and Model Pruning. For each technique, we discuss the underlying principles, present different variants, and provide examples of successful applications. We also briefly discuss complementary techniques such as mixture-of-experts and early-exit strategies. Finally, we highlight promising future directions, aiming to provide a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize LLMs for edge deployment.

<title>Catastrophic Overfitting, Entropy Gap and Participation Ratio: A Noiseless $l^p$ Norm Solution for Fast Adversarial Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02360</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02360</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training is a cornerstone of robust deep learning, but fast methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) often suffer from Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), where models become robust to single-step attacks but fail against multi-step variants. While existing solutions rely on noise injection, regularization, or gradient clipping, we propose a novel solution that purely controls the $l^p$ training norm to mitigate CO.
  Our study is motivated by the empirical observation that CO is more prevalent under the $l^{\infty}$ norm than the $l^2$ norm. Leveraging this insight, we develop a framework for generalized $l^p$ attack as a fixed point problem and craft $l^p$-FGSM attacks to understand the transition mechanics from $l^2$ to $l^{\infty}$. This leads to our core insight: CO emerges when highly concentrated gradients where information localizes in few dimensions interact with aggressive norm constraints. By quantifying gradient concentration through Participation Ratio and entropy measures, we develop an adaptive $l^p$-FGSM that automatically tunes the training norm based on gradient information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong robustness without requiring additional regularization or noise injection, providing a novel and theoretically-principled pathway to mitigate the CO problem.

<title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge, particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter, the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.

arXiv:2505.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across various tasks, but their large storage and computational requirements constrain their deployment on edge devices. To address this, we propose EntroLLM, a novel compression framework that integrates mixed quantization with entropy coding to reduce storage overhead while maintaining model accuracy. Our method applies a layer-wise mixed quantization scheme - choosing between symmetric and asymmetric quantization based on individual layer weight distributions - to optimize compressibility. We then employ Huffman encoding for lossless compression of the quantized weights, significantly reducing memory bandwidth requirements. Furthermore, we introduce parallel Huffman decoding, which enables efficient retrieval of encoded weights during inference, ensuring minimal latency impact. Our experiments on edge-compatible LLMs, including smolLM-1.7B-Instruct, phi3-mini-4k-Instruct, and mistral-7B-Instruct, demonstrate that EntroLLM achieves up to $30%$ storage reduction compared to uint8 models and up to $65%$ storage reduction compared to uint4 models, while preserving perplexity and accuracy, on language benchmark tasks. We further show that our method enables $31.9%$ - $146.6%$ faster inference throughput on memory-bandwidth-limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson P3450, by reducing the required data movement. The proposed approach requires no additional re-training and is fully compatible with existing post-training quantization methods, making it a practical solution for edge LLMs.

Abstract: We address differentially private stochastic bandit problems from the angles of exploring the deep connections among Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors, Gaussian mechanisms, and Gaussian differential privacy (GDP). We propose DP-TS-UCB, a novel parametrized private bandit algorithm that enables to trade off privacy and regret. DP-TS-UCB satisfies $ \tilde{O} \left(T^{0.25(1-\alpha)}\right)$-GDP and enjoys an $O \left(K\ln^{\alpha+1}(T)/\Delta \right)$ regret bound, where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ controls the trade-off between privacy and regret. Theoretically, our DP-TS-UCB relies on anti-concentration bounds of Gaussian distributions and links exploration mechanisms in Thompson Sampling-based algorithms and Upper Confidence Bound-based algorithms, which may be of independent interest.

arXiv:2505.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there is a high demand for deploying DeepSeek-R1 and V3 locally, possibly because the official service often suffers from being busy and some organizations have data privacy concerns. While single-machine deployment offers infrastructure simplicity, the models' 671B FP8 parameter configuration exceeds the practical memory limits of a standard 8-GPU machine. Quantization is a widely used technique that helps reduce model memory consumption. However, it is unclear what the performance of DeepSeek-R1 and V3 will be after being quantized. This technical report presents the first quantitative evaluation of multi-bitwidth quantization across the complete DeepSeek model spectrum. Key findings reveal that 4-bit quantization maintains little performance degradation versus FP8 while enabling single-machine deployment on standard NVIDIA GPU devices. We further propose DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization method that significantly outperforms traditional Q3_K_M variant on various benchmarks, which is also comparable with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) approach in most tasks. Moreover, DQ3_K_M supports single-machine deployment configurations for both NVIDIA H100/A100 and Huawei 910B. Our implementation of DQ3\_K\_M is released at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-Eval, containing optimized 3-bit quantized variants of both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.

<title>Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Reasoners via Gradient Variance Minimization in Rejection Sampling and RL</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) can be formalized as a latent variable problem, where the model needs to generate intermediate reasoning steps. While prior approaches such as iterative reward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they typically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to account for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work identifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The method dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting gradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees under suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be incorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO, leading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/GVM.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show how different machine learning tools on the Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{P}_d$ of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices can be united under a probabilistic framework. For this, we will need several Gaussian distributions defined on $\mathcal{P}_d$. We will show how popular classifiers on $\mathcal{P}_d$ can be reinterpreted as Bayes Classifiers using these Gaussian distributions. These distributions will also be used for outlier detection and dimension reduction. By showing that those distributions are pervasive in the tools used on $\mathcal{P}_d$, we allow for other machine learning tools to be extended to $\mathcal{P}_d$.

Abstract: Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address challenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of multimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose FairPO, a novel framework designed to promote fairness in multi-label classification by directly optimizing preference signals with a group robustness perspective. In our framework, the set of labels is partitioned into privileged and non-privileged groups, and a preference-based loss inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is employed to more effectively differentiate true positive labels from confusing negatives within the privileged group, while preserving baseline classification performance for non-privileged labels. By framing the learning problem as a robust optimization over groups, our approach dynamically adjusts the training emphasis toward groups with poorer performance, thereby mitigating bias and ensuring a fairer treatment across diverse label categories. In addition, we outline plans to extend this approach by investigating alternative loss formulations such as Simple Preference Optimisation (SimPO) and Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to exploit reference-free reward formulations and contrastive training signals. Furthermore, we plan to extend FairPO with multilabel generation capabilities, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and coherent label sets for ambiguous inputs.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance interpretability by identifying alternative inputs that produce different outputs, offering localized insights into model decisions. However, traditional methods often neglect causal relationships, leading to unrealistic examples. While newer approaches integrate causality, they are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method based on backtracking counterfactuals that incorporates causal reasoning to generate actionable explanations. We first examine the limitations of existing methods and then introduce our novel approach and its features. We also explore the relationship between our method and previous techniques, demonstrating that it generalizes them in specific scenarios. Finally, experiments show that our method provides deeper insights into model outputs.

arXiv:2505.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is an essential function that enables interaction with ubiquitous smart devices. However, in resource-limited devices, KWS models are often static and can thus not adapt to new scenarios, such as added keywords. To overcome this problem, we propose a Continual Learning (CL) approach for KWS built on Binary Neural Networks (BNNs). The framework leverages the reduced computation and memory requirements of BNNs while incorporating techniques that enable the seamless integration of new keywords over time. This study evaluates seven CL techniques on a 16-class use case, reporting an accuracy exceeding 95% for a single additional keyword and up to 86% for four additional classes. Sensitivity to the amount of training samples in the CL phase, and differences in computational complexities are being evaluated. These evaluations demonstrate that batch-based algorithms are more sensitive to the CL dataset size, and that differences between the computational complexities are insignificant. These findings highlight the potential of developing an effective and computationally efficient technique for continuously integrating new keywords in KWS applications that is compatible with resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore forgetting in this context, categorizing it into superficial forgetting and essential forgetting. Superficial forgetting refers to cases where the model's knowledge may not be genuinely lost, but its responses to previous tasks deviate from expected formats due to the influence of subsequent tasks' answer styles, making the results unusable. By contrast, essential forgetting refers to situations where the model provides correctly formatted but factually inaccurate answers, indicating a true loss of knowledge. Assessing essential forgetting necessitates addressing superficial forgetting first, as severe superficial forgetting can obscure the model's knowledge state. Hence, we first introduce the Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm, which defines a standardized process for transforming data styles across different tasks, unifying their training sets into similarly diversified styles to prevent superficial forgetting caused by style shifts. Building on this, we propose RegLoRA to mitigate essential forgetting. RegLoRA stabilizes key parameters where prior knowledge is primarily stored by applying regularization, enabling the model to retain existing competencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our overall method, SEFE, achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models on decentralized data. This scheme, however, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, when some of the clients submit corrupted model updates. In real-world scenarios, the total number of compromised clients is typically unknown, with the extent of attacks potentially varying over time. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive approach for robust aggregation of model updates based on Bayesian inference. The mean update is defined by the maximum of the likelihood marginalized over probabilities of each client to be `honest'. As a result, the method shares the simplicity of the classical average estimators (e.g., sample mean or geometric median), being independent of the number of compromised clients. At the same time, it is as effective against attacks as methods specifically tailored to Federated Learning, such as Krum. We compare our approach with other aggregation schemes in federated setting on three benchmark image classification data sets. The proposed method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various attack types with static and varying number of malicious clients.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in medium-range weather prediction but often fail to maintain physically consistent rollouts beyond 14 days. In contrast, a few atmospheric models demonstrate stability over decades, though the key design choices enabling this remain unclear. This study quantitatively compares the long-term stability of three prominent DL-MWP architectures - FourCastNet, SFNO, and ClimaX - trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at 5.625{\deg} resolution. We systematically assess the impact of autoregressive training steps, model capacity, and choice of prognostic variables, identifying configurations that enable stable 10-year rollouts while preserving the statistical properties of the reference dataset. Notably, rollouts with SFNO exhibit the greatest robustness to hyperparameter choices, yet all models can experience instability depending on the random seed and the set of prognostic variables

<title>Uncovering Population PK Covariates from VAE-Generated Latent Spaces</title>

Abstract: Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling is a fundamental tool for understanding drug behaviour across diverse patient populations and enabling personalized dosing strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. A key challenge in PopPK analysis lies in identifying and modelling covariates that influence drug absorption, as these relationships are often complex and nonlinear. Traditional methods may fail to capture hidden patterns within the data. In this study, we propose a data-driven, model-free framework that integrates Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) deep learning model and LASSO regression to uncover key covariates from simulated tacrolimus pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. The VAE compresses high-dimensional PK signals into a structured latent space, achieving accurate reconstruction with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.26%. LASSO regression is then applied to map patient-specific covariates to the latent space, enabling sparse feature selection through L1 regularization. This approach consistently identifies clinically relevant covariates for tacrolimus including SNP, age, albumin, and hemoglobin which are retained across the tested regularization strength levels, while effectively discarding non-informative features. The proposed VAE-LASSO methodology offers a scalable, interpretable, and fully data-driven solution for covariate selection, with promising applications in drug development and precision pharmacotherapy.

<title>FedSDAF: Leveraging Source Domain Awareness for Enhanced Federated Domain Generalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02515</link>

Abstract: Traditional domain generalization approaches predominantly focus on leveraging target domain-aware features while overlooking the critical role of source domain-specific characteristics, particularly in federated settings with inherent data isolation. To address this gap, we propose the Federated Source Domain Awareness Framework (FedSDAF), the first method to systematically exploit source domain-aware features for enhanced federated domain generalization (FedDG). The FedSDAF framework consists of two synergistic components: the Domain-Invariant Adapter, which preserves critical domain-invariant features, and the Domain-Aware Adapter, which extracts and integrates source domain-specific knowledge using a Multihead Self-Attention mechanism (MHSA). Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional knowledge distillation mechanism that fosters knowledge sharing among clients while safeguarding privacy. Our approach represents the first systematic exploitation of source domain-aware features, resulting in significant advancements in model generalization capability.Extensive experiments on four standard benchmarks (OfficeHome, PACS, VLCS, and DomainNet) show that our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art federated domain generalization approaches, with accuracy gains of 5.2-13.8%.

<title>Advancing Constrained Monotonic Neural Networks: Achieving Universal Approximation Beyond Bounded Activations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02537</link>

Abstract: Conventional techniques for imposing monotonicity in MLPs by construction involve the use of non-negative weight constraints and bounded activation functions, which pose well-known optimization challenges. In this work, we generalize previous theoretical results, showing that MLPs with non-negative weight constraint and activations that saturate on alternating sides are universal approximators for monotonic functions. Additionally, we show an equivalence between the saturation side in the activations and the sign of the weight constraint. This connection allows us to prove that MLPs with convex monotone activations and non-positive constrained weights also qualify as universal approximators, in contrast to their non-negative constrained counterparts. Our results provide theoretical grounding to the empirical effectiveness observed in previous works while leading to possible architectural simplification. Moreover, to further alleviate the optimization difficulties, we propose an alternative formulation that allows the network to adjust its activations according to the sign of the weights. This eliminates the requirement for weight reparameterization, easing initialization and improving training stability. Experimental evaluation reinforces the validity of the theoretical results, showing that our novel approach compares favourably to traditional monotonic architectures.

<title>Lazy But Effective: Collaborative Personalized Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02540</link>

Abstract: In Federated Learning, heterogeneity in client data distributions often means that a single global model does not have the best performance for individual clients. Consider for example training a next-word prediction model for keyboards: user-specific language patterns due to demographics (dialect, age, etc.), language proficiency, and writing style result in a highly non-IID dataset across clients. Other examples are medical images taken with different machines, or driving data from different vehicle types. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective personalized federated learning framework (pFedLIA) that utilizes a computationally efficient influence approximation, called `Lazy Influence', to cluster clients in a distributed manner before model aggregation. Within each cluster, data owners collaborate to jointly train a model that captures the specific data patterns of the clients. Our method has been shown to successfully recover the global model's performance drop due to the non-IID-ness in various synthetic and real-world settings, specifically a next-word prediction task on the Nordic languages as well as several benchmark tasks. It matches the performance of a hypothetical Oracle clustering, and significantly improves on existing baselines, e.g., an improvement of 17% on CIFAR100.

Abstract: We introduce Bielik v3, a series of parameter-efficient generative text models (1.5B and 4.5B) optimized for Polish language processing. These models demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our approach incorporates several key innovations: a custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency, Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks, including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the 1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile. These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI more accessible for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a cornerstone in graph-based data analysis, with applications in diverse domains such as bioinformatics, social networks, and recommendation systems. However, the interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors on the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms.
  We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across five datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability metrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model training, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between robustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open source.
  The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on the chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics. By establishing a standardized benchmark, this work provides a foundation for developing GNNs that are both robust to adversarial threats and interpretable, facilitating trust in their deployment in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Federated graph learning is a widely recognized technique that promotes collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client graphs.However, existing approaches heavily rely on the communication of model parameters or gradients for federated optimization and fail to adequately address the data heterogeneity introduced by intricate and diverse graph distributions. Although some methods attempt to share additional messages among the server and clients to improve federated convergence during communication, they introduce significant privacy risks and increase communication overhead. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of a condensed graph as a novel optimization carrier to address FGL data heterogeneity and propose a new FGL paradigm called FedGM. Specifically, we utilize a generalized condensation graph consensus to aggregate comprehensive knowledge from distributed graphs, while minimizing communication costs and privacy risks through a single transmission of the condensed data. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedGM over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its potential for a novel FGL paradigm.

<title>Towards Cross-Modality Modeling for Time Series Analytics: A Survey in the LLM Era</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of edge devices has generated an unprecedented volume of time series data across different domains, motivating various well-customized methods. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for time series analytics by leveraging the shared sequential nature of textual data and time series. However, a fundamental cross-modality gap between time series and LLMs exists, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. Many recent proposals are designed to address this issue. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLMs-based cross-modality modeling for time series analytics. We first introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into four groups based on the type of textual data employed for time series modeling. We then summarize key cross-modality strategies, e.g., alignment and fusion, and discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on multimodal datasets from different application domains to investigate effective combinations of textual data and cross-modality strategies for enhancing time series analytics. Finally, we suggest several promising directions for future research. This survey is designed for a range of professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in LLM-based time series modeling.

Abstract: Visualizations of the loss landscape in neural networks suggest that minima are isolated points. However, both theoretical and empirical studies indicate that it is possible to connect two different minima with a path consisting of intermediate points that also have low loss. In this study, we propose a new algorithm which investigates low-loss paths in the full parameter space, not only between two minima. Our experiments on LeNet5, ResNet18, and Compact Convolutional Transformer architectures consistently demonstrate the existence of such continuous paths in the parameter space. These results suggest that the low-loss region is a fully connected and continuous space in the parameter space. Our findings provide theoretical insight into neural network over-parameterization, highlighting that parameters collectively define a high-dimensional low-loss space, implying parameter redundancy exists only within individual models and not throughout the entire low-loss space. Additionally, our work also provides new visualization methods and opportunities to improve model generalization by exploring the low-loss space that is closer to the origin.

Abstract: The mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) minimizes an entropy-regularized nonlinear convex functional on the Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^d$, and has gained attention recently as a model for the gradient descent dynamics of interacting particle systems such as infinite-width two-layer neural networks. However, many problems of interest have constrained domains, which are not solved by existing mean-field algorithms due to the global diffusion term. We study the optimization of probability measures constrained to a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by proposing the \emph{mirror mean-field Langevin dynamics} (MMFLD), an extension of MFLD to the mirror Langevin framework. We obtain linear convergence guarantees for the continuous MMFLD via a uniform log-Sobolev inequality, and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos results for its time- and particle-discretized counterpart.

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a crucial property in artificial intelligence, enabling models to handle novel combinations of known components. While most deep learning models lack this capability, certain models succeed in specific tasks, suggesting the existence of governing conditions. This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition for compositional generalization in neural networks. Conceptually, it requires that (i) the computational graph matches the true compositional structure, and (ii) components encode just enough information in training. The condition is supported by mathematical proofs. This criterion combines aspects of architecture design, regularization, and training data properties. A carefully designed minimal example illustrates an intuitive understanding of the condition. We also discuss the potential of the condition for assessing compositional generalization before training. This work is a fundamental theoretical study of compositional generalization in neural networks.

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to introduce a transfer learning-enhanced, multi-objective, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology that is able to optimise the geometry of any airfoil based on concomitant aerodynamic and structural criteria. To showcase the method, we aim to maximise the lift-to-drag ratio $C_L/C_D$ while preserving the structural integrity of the airfoil -- as modelled by its maximum thickness -- and train the DRL agent using a list of different transfer learning (TL) strategies. The performance of the DRL agent is compared with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a traditional gradient-free optimisation method. Results indicate that DRL agents are able to perform multi-objective shape optimisation, that the DRL approach outperforms PSO in terms of computational efficiency and shape optimisation performance, and that the TL-enhanced DRL agent achieves performance comparable to the DRL one, while further saving substantial computational resources.

Abstract: Chemical reaction and retrosynthesis prediction are fundamental tasks in drug discovery. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in many domains. However, directly applying LLMs to these tasks faces two major challenges: (i) lacking a large-scale chemical synthesis-related instruction dataset; (ii) ignoring the close correlation between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4 million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy, to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further highlighting its strong potential in drug design.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly operate in environments where devices must respond in real time while managing fluctuating resource constraints, including energy and bandwidth. Yet, current approaches often fall short in addressing scenarios where operational constraints evolve over time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandit framework tailored for IoT applications with dynamic operational limits. Our model introduces a decaying violation budget, which permits limited constraint violations early in the learning process and gradually enforces stricter compliance over time. We present the Budgeted Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which adaptively balances performance optimization and compliance with time-varying constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that Budgeted UCB achieves sublinear regret and logarithmic constraint violations over the learning horizon. Extensive simulations in a wireless communication setting show that our approach achieves faster adaptation and better constraint satisfaction than standard online learning methods. These results highlight the framework's potential for building adaptive, resource-aware IoT systems.

Abstract: The Transformer model has shown strong performance in multivariate time series forecasting by leveraging channel-wise self-attention. However, this approach lacks temporal constraints when computing temporal features and does not utilize cumulative historical series effectively.To address these limitations, we propose the Structured Channel-wise Transformer with Cumulative Historical state (SCFormer). SCFormer introduces temporal constraints to all linear transformations, including the query, key, and value matrices, as well as the fully connected layers within the Transformer. Additionally, SCFormer employs High-order Polynomial Projection Operators (HiPPO) to deal with cumulative historical time series, allowing the model to incorporate information beyond the look-back window during prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SCFormer significantly outperforms mainstream baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing time series forecasting. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ShiweiGuo1995/SCFormer

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, discovering reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Addressing the computational challenges inherent in training large-scale deep neural networks remains a critical endeavor in contemporary machine learning research. While previous efforts have focused on enhancing training efficiency through techniques such as gradient descent with momentum, learning rate scheduling, and weight regularization, the demand for further innovation continues to burgeon as model sizes keep expanding. In this study, we introduce a novel framework which diverges from conventional approaches by leveraging long-term time series forecasting techniques. Our method capitalizes solely on initial and final weight values, offering a streamlined alternative for complex model architectures. We also introduce a novel regularizer that is tailored to enhance the forecasting performance of our approach. Empirical evaluations conducted on synthetic weight sequences and real-world deep learning architectures, including the prominent large language model DistilBERT, demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, our framework showcases improved performance while requiring minimal additional computational overhead, thus presenting a promising avenue for accelerating the training process across diverse tasks and architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a prominent solution for Natural Language Processing tasks. Notably, they can approach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some challenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or missing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems cannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a time-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information to enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for zero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the hierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune the candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input prompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only enhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific models. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the leveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.

Abstract: Real-world data contains aleatoric uncertainty - irreducible noise arising from imperfect measurements or from incomplete knowledge about the data generation process. Mean variance estimation (MVE) networks can learn this type of uncertainty but require ad-hoc regularization strategies to avoid overfitting and are unable to predict epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty). Conversely, Bayesian neural networks predict epistemic uncertainty but are notoriously difficult to train due to the approximate nature of Bayesian inference. We propose to cooperatively train a variance network with a Bayesian neural network and demonstrate that the resulting model disentangles aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties while improving the mean estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this method across a diverse range of datasets, including a time-dependent heteroscedastic regression dataset we created where the aleatoric uncertainty is known. The proposed method is straightforward to implement, robust, and adaptable to various model architectures.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs, revolutionizing the natural language processing domain and beyond. Due to immense parameter sizes, fine-tuning these models with private data for diverse downstream tasks has become mainstream. Though federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs without sharing raw data, substantial computing costs hinder its democratization. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, private client devices often possess heterogeneous computing resources, further complicating LLM fine-tuning. To combat these challenges, we propose HSplitLoRA, a heterogeneous parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework built on split learning (SL) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on heterogeneous client devices. HSplitLoRA first identifies important weights based on their contributions to LLM training. It then dynamically configures the decomposition ranks of LoRA adapters for selected weights and determines the model split point according to varying computing budgets of client devices. Finally, a noise-free adapter aggregation mechanism is devised to support heterogeneous adapter aggregation without introducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSplitLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.

Abstract: Empirical studies reported that the Hessian matrix of neural networks (NNs) exhibits a near-block-diagonal structure, yet its theoretical foundation remains unclear. In this work, we reveal two forces that shape the Hessian structure: a ``static force'' rooted in the architecture design, and a ``dynamic force'' arisen from training. We then provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of ``static force'' at random initialization. We study linear models and 1-hidden-layer networks with the mean-square (MSE) loss and the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss for classification tasks. By leveraging random matrix theory, we compare the limit distributions of the diagonal and off-diagonal Hessian blocks and find that the block-diagonal structure arises as $C \rightarrow \infty$, where $C$ denotes the number of classes. Our findings reveal that $C$ is a primary driver of the near-block-diagonal structure. These results may shed new light on the Hessian structure of large language models (LLMs), which typically operate with a large $C$ exceeding $10^4$ or $10^5$.

Abstract: Understanding the binding specificity between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) is central to immunotherapy and vaccine development. However, current predictive models struggle with generalization, especially in data-scarce settings and when faced with novel epitopes. We present LANTERN (Large lAnguage model-powered TCR-Enhanced Recognition Network), a deep learning framework that combines large-scale protein language models with chemical representations of peptides. By encoding TCR \b{eta}-chain sequences using ESM-1b and transforming peptide sequences into SMILES strings processed by MolFormer, LANTERN captures rich biological and chemical features critical for TCR-peptide recognition. Through extensive benchmarking against existing models such as ChemBERTa, TITAN, and NetTCR, LANTERN demonstrates superior performance, particularly in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Our model also benefits from a robust negative sampling strategy and shows significant clustering improvements via embedding analysis. These results highlight the potential of LANTERN to advance TCR-pMHC binding prediction and support the development of personalized immunotherapies.

Abstract: Language models for scientific tasks are trained on text from scientific publications, most distributed as PDFs that require parsing. PDF parsing approaches range from inexpensive heuristics (for simple documents) to computationally intensive ML-driven systems (for complex or degraded ones). The choice of the "best" parser for a particular document depends on its computational cost and the accuracy of its output. To address these issues, we introduce an Adaptive Parallel PDF Parsing and Resource Scaling Engine (AdaParse), a data-driven strategy for assigning an appropriate parser to each document. We enlist scientists to select preferred parser outputs and incorporate this information through direct preference optimization (DPO) into AdaParse, thereby aligning its selection process with human judgment. AdaParse then incorporates hardware requirements and predicted accuracy of each parser to orchestrate computational resources efficiently for large-scale parsing campaigns. We demonstrate that AdaParse, when compared to state-of-the-art parsers, improves throughput by $17\times$ while still achieving comparable accuracy (0.2 percent better) on a benchmark set of 1000 scientific documents. AdaParse's combination of high accuracy and parallel scalability makes it feasible to parse large-scale scientific document corpora to support the development of high-quality, trillion-token-scale text datasets. The implementation is available at https://github.com/7shoe/AdaParse/

<title>Sparsification Under Siege: Defending Against Poisoning Attacks in Communication-Efficient Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet it faces significant challenges in communication efficiency and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. While sparsification techniques mitigate communication overhead by transmitting only critical model parameters, they inadvertently amplify security risks: adversarial clients can exploit sparse updates to evade detection and degrade model performance. Existing defense mechanisms, designed for standard FL communication scenarios, are ineffective in addressing these vulnerabilities within sparsified FL. To bridge this gap, we propose FLARE, a novel federated learning framework that integrates sparse index mask inspection and model update sign similarity analysis to detect and mitigate poisoning attacks in sparsified FL. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that FLARE significantly outperforms existing defense strategies, effectively securing sparsified FL against poisoning attacks while maintaining communication efficiency.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are successful with weather forecasting and have shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using NeuralGCM, a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist anomalies present at initialization. With such forcings, NeuralGCM simulates realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns. Furthermore, this configuration yields useful seasonal predictions (July-November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics. Notably, the prediction skill for TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins is comparable to existing physical models. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions.

Abstract: This paper introduces MoxE, a novel architecture that synergistically combines the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to address critical scalability and efficiency challenges in large language models (LLMs). The proposed method effectively leverages xLSTM's innovative memory structures while strategically introducing sparsity through MoE to substantially reduce computational overhead. At the heart of our approach is a novel entropy-based routing mechanism, designed to dynamically route tokens to specialized experts, thereby ensuring efficient and balanced resource utilization. This entropy awareness enables the architecture to effectively manage both rare and common tokens, with mLSTM blocks being favored to handle rare tokens. To further enhance generalization, we introduce a suite of auxiliary losses, including entropy-based and group-wise balancing losses, ensuring robust performance and efficient training. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations rigorously demonstrate that MoxE achieves significant efficiency gains and enhanced effectiveness compared to existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in scalable LLM architectures.

Abstract: Protecting cloud applications is crucial in an age where security constantly threatens the digital world. The inevitable cyber-attacks throughout the CI/CD pipeline make cloud security innovations necessary. This research is motivated by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, such as Topic Modelling, to analyse cloud security data and predict future attacks. This research aims to use topic modelling, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA). Utilising LDA and PLSA, security-related text data, such as reports, logs, and other relevant documents, will be analysed and sorted into relevant topics (such as phishing or encryption). These algorithms may apply through Python using the Gensim framework. The topics shall be utilised to detect vulnerabilities within relevant CI/CD pipeline records or log data. This application of Topic Modelling anticipates providing a new form of vulnerability detection, improving overall security throughout the CI/CD pipeline.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation with foundation models has gained attention for its realism and wide applications. While these models produce high-quality frames, they often fail to respect common sense and physical laws, resulting in abnormal content. Existing metrics like VideoScore emphasize general quality but ignore such violations and lack interpretability. A more insightful approach is using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as interpretable evaluators, as seen in FactScore. Yet, MLLMs' ability to detect abnormalities in synthetic videos remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark featuring synthetic videos from models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-designed QA tasks solvable via human-level reasoning across various categories. We assess several SoTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen-2.5-VL, and newer models like Video-R1 and VideoChat-R1. Despite strong real-world performance on MVBench and MovieChat, these models still hallucinate on basic commonsense and physics tasks in synthetic settings, underscoring the challenge of hallucination. We further fine-tune SoTA MLLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on real and synthetic commonsense/physics data. Results show notable accuracy gains, especially with counterexample integration, advancing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our data is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.

We propose an undetectable and elementary watermarking scheme in the closed setting. Also, in the harder open setting, where the adversary has access to most of the model, we propose an unremovable watermarking scheme.

<title>The DCR Delusion: Measuring the Privacy Risk of Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: Synthetic data has become an increasingly popular way to share data without revealing sensitive information. Though Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely considered the gold standard for empirically assessing the privacy of a synthetic dataset, practitioners and researchers often rely on simpler proxy metrics such as Distance to Closest Record (DCR). These metrics estimate privacy by measuring the similarity between the training data and generated synthetic data. This similarity is also compared against that between the training data and a disjoint holdout set of real records to construct a binary privacy test. If the synthetic data is not more similar to the training data than the holdout set is, it passes the test and is considered private. In this work we show that, while computationally inexpensive, DCR and other distance-based metrics fail to identify privacy leakage. Across multiple datasets and both classical models such as Baynet and CTGAN and more recent diffusion models, we show that datasets deemed private by proxy metrics are highly vulnerable to MIAs. We similarly find both the binary privacy test and the continuous measure based on these metrics to be uninformative of actual membership inference risk. We further show that these failures are consistent across different metric hyperparameter settings and record selection methods. Finally, we argue DCR and other distance-based metrics to be flawed by design and show a example of a simple leakage they miss in practice. With this work, we hope to motivate practitioners to move away from proxy metrics to MIAs as the rigorous, comprehensive standard of evaluating privacy of synthetic data, in particular to make claims of datasets being legally anonymous.

<title>HoneyBee: Efficient Role-based Access Control for Vector Databases via Dynamic Partitioning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01538</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As vector databases gain traction in enterprise applications, robust access control has become critical to safeguard sensitive data. Access control in these systems is often implemented through hybrid vector queries, which combine nearest neighbor search on vector data with relational predicates based on user permissions. However, existing approaches face significant trade-offs: creating dedicated indexes for each user minimizes query latency but introduces excessive storage redundancy, while building a single index and applying access control after vector search reduces storage overhead but suffers from poor recall and increased query latency. This paper introduces HoneyBee, a dynamic partitioning framework that bridges the gap between these approaches by leveraging the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. RBAC, widely adopted in enterprise settings, groups users into roles and assigns permissions to those roles, creating a natural "thin waist" in the permission structure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HoneyBee produces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated across different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling storage overhead. By introducing analytical models for the performance and recall of the vector search, HoneyBee formulates the partitioning strategy as a constrained optimization problem to dynamically balance storage, query efficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HoneyBee reduces storage redundancy compared to role partitioning and achieves up to 6x faster query speeds than row-level security (RLS) with only 1.4x storage increase, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector search.

Abstract: Generative large language models as tools in the legal domain have the potential to improve the justice system. However, the reasoning behavior of current generative models is brittle and poorly understood, hence cannot be responsibly applied in the domains of law and evidence. In this paper, we introduce an approach for creating benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of generative language models. These benchmarks are dynamically varied, scalable in their complexity, and have formally unambiguous interpretations. In this study, we illustrate the approach on the basis of witness testimony, focusing on the underlying argument attack structure. We dynamically generate both linear and non-linear argument attack graphs of varying complexity and translate these into reasoning puzzles about witness testimony expressed in natural language. We show that state-of-the-art large language models often fail in these reasoning puzzles, already at low complexity. Obvious mistakes are made by the models, and their inconsistent performance indicates that their reasoning capabilities are brittle. Furthermore, at higher complexity, even state-of-the-art models specifically presented for reasoning capabilities make mistakes. We show the viability of using a parametrized benchmark with varying complexity to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of generative language models. As such, the findings contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of the reasoning capabilities of generative models, which is essential when designing responsible AI systems in the legal domain.

Abstract: In this work, we seek to understand the performance of large language models in the mechanical engineering domain. We leverage the semantic data found in the ABC dataset, specifically the assembly names that designers assigned to the overall assemblies, and the individual semantic part names that were assigned to each part. After pre-processing the data we developed two unsupervised tasks to evaluate how different model architectures perform on domain-specific data: a binary sentence-pair classification task and a zero-shot classification task. We achieved a 0.62 accuracy for the binary sentence-pair classification task with a fine-tuned model that focuses on fighting over-fitting: 1) modifying learning rates, 2) dropout values, 3) Sequence Length, and 4) adding a multi-head attention layer. Our model on the zero-shot classification task outperforms the baselines by a wide margin, and achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 0.386. The results shed some light on the specific failure modes that arise when learning from language in this domain.

Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art model for fine-grained probability estimation of propositions conditioned on context. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, particularly on well-defined tasks with complete information. However, LLMs continue to struggle with making accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic predictions under uncertainty or partial information. While incorporating uncertainty into model predictions often boosts performance, obtaining reliable estimates of that uncertainty remains understudied. In particular, LLM probability estimates tend to be coarse and biased towards more frequent numbers. Through a combination of human and synthetic data creation and assessment, scaling to larger models, and better supervision, we propose a set of strong and precise probability estimation models. We conduct systematic evaluations across tasks that rely on conditional probability estimation and show that our approach consistently outperforms existing fine-tuned and prompting-based methods by a large margin.

Abstract: To accommodate ever-increasing model complexity, modern machine learning (ML) systems have to scale to large GPU clusters. Changes in ML model architecture, ML system implementation, and cluster configuration can significantly affect overall ML system performance. However, quantifying the performance impact before deployment is challenging. Existing performance estimation methods use performance modeling or static workload simulation. These techniques are not general: they requires significant human effort and computation capacity to generate training data or a workload. It is also difficult to adapt ML systems to use these techniques. This paper introduces, Phantora, a live GPU cluster simulator for performance estimation. Phantora runs minimally modified ML models and frameworks, intercepting and simulating GPU-related operations to enable high-fidelity performance estimation. Phantora overcomes several research challenges in integrating an event-driven network simulator with live system execution, and introduces a set of techniques to improve simulation speed, scalability, and accuracy. Our evaluation results show that Phantora can deliver similar estimation accuracy to the state-of-the-art workload simulation approach with only one GPU, while reducing human effort and increasing generalizability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and task generalization. However, their application to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies in schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output, and limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper introduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output Transformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven transformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic alignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight schema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic context construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile of the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured prompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable outputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates a refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based on execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a reasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of adjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is a robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with LLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where interpretability, stability, and correctness are essential.

Abstract: High-throughput neural network inference requires coordinating many optimization decisions, including parallel tiling, microkernel selection, and data layout. The product of these decisions forms a search space of programs which is typically intractably large. Existing approaches (e.g., auto-schedulers) often address this problem by sampling this space heuristically. In contrast, we introduce a dynamic-programming-based approach to explore more of the search space by iteratively decomposing large program specifications into smaller specifications reachable from a set of rewrites, then composing a final program from each rewrite that minimizes an affine cost model. To reduce memory requirements, we employ a novel memoization table representation, which indexes specifications by coordinates in $Z_{\geq 0}$ and compresses identical, adjacent solutions. This approach can visit a much larger set of programs than prior work. To evaluate the approach, we developed Morello, a compiler which lowers specifications roughly equivalent to a few-node XLA computation graph to x86. Notably, we found that an affine cost model is sufficient to surface high-throughput programs. For example, Morello synthesized a collection of matrix multiplication benchmarks targeting a Zen 1 CPU, including a 1x2048x16384, bfloat16-to-float32 vector-matrix multiply, which was integrated into Google's gemma.cpp.

Abstract: L\'evy processes are widely used in financial modeling due to their ability to capture discontinuities and heavy tails, which are common in high-frequency asset return data. However, parameter estimation remains a challenge when associated likelihoods are unavailable or costly to compute. We propose a fast and accurate method for L\'evy parameter estimation using the neural Bayes estimation (NBE) framework -- a simulation-based, likelihood-free approach that leverages permutation-invariant neural networks to approximate Bayes estimators. Through extensive simulations across several L\'evy models, we show that NBE outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and runtime, while also enabling rapid bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. We illustrate our approach on a challenging high-frequency cryptocurrency return dataset, where the method captures evolving parameter dynamics and delivers reliable and interpretable inference at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. NBE provides a scalable and practical solution for inference in complex financial models, enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification over an entire year of data in just seconds. We additionally investigate nearly a decade of high-frequency Bitcoin returns, requiring less than one minute to estimate parameters under the proposed approach.

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However, understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying spectral 'doppelg\"angers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width, velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.

These observations are processed through a leaf grasping algorithm that selects the optimal leaf based on clutter, visibility, and distance, and determines a grasp point by analyzing local surface flatness, top-down approachability, and margin from edges. The selected grasp point guides a trajectory executed by ROS-based motion controllers, driving a custom microneedle-equipped end-effector to clamp the leaf and simulate tissue sampling. Experiments conducted with artificial plants under varied poses demonstrate that the T-Rex system can consistently detect, plan, and perform physical interactions with plant-like targets, achieving a grasp success rate of 66.6\%. This paper presents the system architecture, implementation, and testing of T-Rex as a step toward plant sampling automation in Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA).

Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to fMRI-based visual image reconstruction using a subject-agnostic common representation space. We show that the brain signals of the subjects can be aligned in this common space during training to form a semantically aligned common brain. This is leveraged to demonstrate that aligning subject-specific lightweight modules to a reference subject is significantly more efficient than traditional end-to-end training methods. Our approach excels in low-data scenarios. We evaluate our methods on different datasets, demonstrating that the common space is subject and dataset-agnostic.

<title>Inducing Robustness in a 2 Dimensional Direct Preference Optimization Paradigm</title>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) has emerged as a powerful method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a stable and efficient alternative to approaches that use Reinforcement learning via Human Feedback. In this work, we investigate the performance of DPO using open-source preference datasets. One of the major drawbacks of DPO is that it doesn't induce granular scoring and treats all the segments of the responses with equal propensity. However, this is not practically true for human preferences since even "good" responses have segments that may not be preferred by the annotator. To resolve this, a 2-dimensional scoring for DPO alignment called 2D-DPO was proposed. We explore the 2D-DPO alignment paradigm and the advantages it provides over the standard DPO by comparing their win rates. It is observed that these methods, even though effective, are not robust to label/score noise. To counter this, we propose an approach of incorporating segment-level score noise robustness to the 2D-DPO algorithm. Along with theoretical backing, we also provide empirical verification in favour of the algorithm and introduce other noise models that can be present.

<title>Easz: An Agile Transformer-based Image Compression Framework for Resource-constrained IoTs</title>

Abstract: Neural image compression, necessary in various machine-to-machine communication scenarios, suffers from its heavy encode-decode structures and inflexibility in switching between different compression levels. Consequently, it raises significant challenges in applying the neural image compression to edge devices that are developed for powerful servers with high computational and storage capacities. We take a step to solve the challenges by proposing a new transformer-based edge-compute-free image coding framework called Easz. Easz shifts the computational overhead to the server, and hence avoids the heavy encoding and model switching overhead on the edge. Easz utilizes a patch-erase algorithm to selectively remove image contents using a conditional uniform-based sampler. The erased pixels are reconstructed on the receiver side through a transformer-based framework. To further reduce the computational overhead on the receiver, we then introduce a lightweight transformer-based reconstruction structure to reduce the reconstruction load on the receiver side. Extensive evaluations conducted on a real-world testbed demonstrate multiple advantages of Easz over existing compression approaches, in terms of adaptability to different compression levels, computational efficiency, and image reconstruction quality.

<title>An LLM-Empowered Low-Resolution Vision System for On-Device Human Behavior Understanding</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer the potential to surpass conventional labeling by generating richer, more detailed descriptions of on-device human behavior understanding (HBU) in low-resolution vision systems, such as depth, thermal, and infrared. However, existing large vision language model (LVLM) approaches are unable to understand low-resolution data well as they are primarily designed for high-resolution data, such as RGB images. A quick fixing approach is to caption a large amount of low-resolution data, but it requires a significant amount of labor-intensive annotation efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel, labor-saving system, Llambda, designed to support low-resolution HBU. The core idea is to leverage limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to guide LLMs in generating informative captions, which can be combined with raw data to effectively fine-tune LVLM models for understanding low-resolution videos in HBU. First, we propose a Contrastive-Oriented Data Labeler, which can capture behavior-relevant information from long, low-resolution videos and generate high-quality pseudo labels for unlabeled data via contrastive learning. Second, we propose a Physical-Knowledge Guided Captioner, which utilizes spatial and temporal consistency checks to mitigate errors in pseudo labels. Therefore, it can improve LLMs' understanding of sequential data and then generate high-quality video captions. Finally, to ensure on-device deployability, we employ LoRA-based efficient fine-tuning to adapt LVLMs for low-resolution data. We evaluate Llambda using a region-scale real-world testbed and three distinct low-resolution datasets, and the experiments show that Llambda outperforms several state-of-the-art LVLM systems up to $40.03\%$ on average Bert-Score.

Abstract: It has been observed by Belkin et al.\ that overparametrized neural networks exhibit a `double descent' phenomenon. That is, as the model complexity, as reflected in the number of features, increases, the training error initially decreases, then increases, and then decreases again. A counterpart of this phenomenon in the time domain has been noted in the context of epoch-wise training, viz., that the training error decreases with time, then increases, then decreases again. This note presents a plausible explanation for this phenomenon by using the theory of two time scale stochastic approximation and singularly perturbed differential equations, applied to the continuous time limit of the gradient dynamics. This adds a `dynamic' angle to an already well studied theme.

Abstract: Biased news reporting poses a significant threat to informed decision-making and the functioning of democracies. This study introduces a novel methodology for scalable, minimally biased analysis of media bias in political news. The proposed approach examines event selection, labeling, word choice, and commission and omission biases across news sources by leveraging natural language processing techniques, including hierarchical topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and ontology learning with large language models. Through three case studies related to current political events, we demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness in identifying biases across news sources at various levels of granularity. This work represents a significant step towards scalable, minimally biased media bias analysis, laying the groundwork for tools to help news consumers navigate an increasingly complex media landscape.

Abstract: Estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatments on survival outcomes is a challenging task in many domains, particularly in medicine where treatment protocols adapt over time. While recent advances in representation learning have improved causal inference for static treatments, extending these methods to dynamic treatment regimes with survival outcomes remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce TV-SurvCaus, a novel framework that extends representation balancing techniques to the time-varying treatment setting for survival analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees through (1) a generalized bound for time-varying precision in estimation of heterogeneous effects, (2) variance control via sequential balancing weights, (3) consistency results for dynamic treatment regimes, (4) convergence rates for representation learning with temporal dependencies, and (5) a formal bound on the bias due to treatment-confounder feedback. Our neural architecture incorporates sequence modeling to handle temporal dependencies while balancing time-dependent representations. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that TV-SurvCaus outperforms existing methods in estimating individualized treatment effects with time-varying covariates and treatments. Our framework advances the field of causal inference by enabling more accurate estimation of treatment effects in dynamic, longitudinal settings with survival outcomes.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of AI-generated texts highlights the urgent need for accurate and transparent detection tools, especially in educational settings, where verifying authorship is essential. Existing literature has demonstrated that the application of stylometric features with machine learning classifiers can yield excellent results. Building on this foundation, this study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates stylometric analysis with psycholinguistic theories, offering a clear and interpretable approach to distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written texts. This research specifically maps 31 distinct stylometric features to cognitive processes such as lexical retrieval, discourse planning, cognitive load management, and metacognitive self-monitoring. In doing so, it highlights the unique psycholinguistic patterns found in human writing. Through the intersection of computational linguistics and cognitive science, this framework contributes to the development of reliable tools aimed at preserving academic integrity in the era of generative AI.

Abstract: We aim to approximate a continuously differentiable function $u:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by a composition of functions $f\circ g$ where $g:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, $m\leq d$, and $f : \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are built in a two stage procedure. For a fixed $g$, we build $f$ using classical regression methods, involving evaluations of $u$. Recent works proposed to build a nonlinear $g$ by minimizing a loss function $\mathcal{J}(g)$ derived from Poincar\'e inequalities on manifolds, involving evaluations of the gradient of $u$. A problem is that minimizing $\mathcal{J}$ may be a challenging task. Hence in this work, we introduce new convex surrogates to $\mathcal{J}$. Leveraging concentration inequalities, we provide sub-optimality results for a class of functions $g$, including polynomials, and a wide class of input probability measures. We investigate performances on different benchmarks for various training sample sizes. We show that our approach outperforms standard iterative methods for minimizing the training Poincar\'e inequality based loss, often resulting in better approximation errors, especially for rather small training sets and $m=1$.

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can effortlessly internalize new information ("news") and accurately extract the implications for performing downstream tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context learning (ICL) when the news is explicitly given as context, fine-tuning remains challenging for the models to consolidate learning in weights. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{New News}$, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries, leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news. We first demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context learning (FT-ICL gap) on our news dataset. To address this gap, we explore a suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications and Self-QAs -- designed to distill the knowledge from the model with context into the weights of the model without the context, which we term $\textit{System-2 Fine-tuning}$ (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our results demonstrate that the self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves models' in-weight learning of the news. Furthermore, we discover the $\textit{contexual shadowing effect}$, where training with the news $\textit{in context}$ followed by its rephrases or QAs degrade learning of the news. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture is revolutionizing cellular networks with its open, multi-vendor design and AI-driven management, aiming to enhance flexibility and reduce costs. Although it has many advantages, O-RAN is not threat-free. While previous studies have mainly examined vulnerabilities arising from O-RAN's intelligent components, this paper is the first to focus on the security challenges and vulnerabilities introduced by transitioning from single-operator to multi-operator RAN architectures. This shift increases the risk of untrusted third-party operators managing different parts of the network. To explore these vulnerabilities and their potential mitigation, we developed an open-access testbed environment that integrates a wireless network simulator with the official O-RAN Software Community (OSC) RAN intelligent component (RIC) cluster. This environment enables realistic, live data collection and serves as a platform for demonstrating APATE (adversarial perturbation against traffic efficiency), an evasion attack in which a malicious cell manipulates its reported key performance indicators (KPIs) and deceives the O-RAN traffic steering to gain unfair allocations of user equipment (UE). To ensure that O-RAN's legitimate activity continues, we introduce MARRS (monitoring adversarial RAN reports), a detection framework based on a long-short term memory (LSTM) autoencoder (AE) that learns contextual features across the network to monitor malicious telemetry (also demonstrated in our testbed). Our evaluation showed that by executing APATE, an attacker can obtain a 248.5% greater UE allocation than it was supposed to in a benign scenario. In addition, the MARRS detection method was also shown to successfully classify malicious cell activity, achieving accuracy of 99.2% and an F1 score of 0.978.

Abstract: Edge-cloud collaborative computing (ECCC) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing the computational demands of modern intelligent applications, integrating cloud resources with edge devices to enable efficient, low-latency processing. Recent advancements in AI, particularly deep learning and large language models (LLMs), have dramatically enhanced the capabilities of these distributed systems, yet introduce significant challenges in model deployment and resource management. In this survey, we comprehensive examine the intersection of distributed intelligence and model optimization within edge-cloud environments, providing a structured tutorial on fundamental architectures, enabling technologies, and emerging applications. Additionally, we systematically analyze model optimization approaches, including compression, adaptation, and neural architecture search, alongside AI-driven resource management strategies that balance performance, energy efficiency, and latency requirements. We further explore critical aspects of privacy protection and security enhancement within ECCC systems and examines practical deployments through diverse applications, spanning autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. Performance analysis and benchmarking techniques are also thoroughly explored to establish evaluation standards for these complex systems. Furthermore, the review identifies critical research directions including LLMs deployment, 6G integration, neuromorphic computing, and quantum computing, offering a roadmap for addressing persistent challenges in heterogeneity management, real-time processing, and scalability. By bridging theoretical advancements and practical deployments, this survey offers researchers and practitioners a holistic perspective on leveraging AI to optimize distributed computing environments, fostering innovation in next-generation intelligent systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for solving planning and learning problems of Markov decision processes. The proposed algorithm follows a policy iteration-type update by using a rank-one approximation of the transition probability matrix in the policy evaluation step. This rank-one approximation is closely related to the stationary distribution of the corresponding transition probability matrix, which is approximated using the power method. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm to optimal (action-)value function with the same rate and computational complexity as the value iteration algorithm in the planning problem and as the Q-learning algorithm in the learning problem. Through our extensive numerical simulations, however, we show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms first-order algorithms and their accelerated versions for both planning and learning problems.

Abstract: The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a popular framework for sequential decision-making problems, and uncertainty quantification is an essential component of it to learn optimal decision-making strategies. In particular, a Bayesian framework is used to maintain beliefs about the optimal decisions and the unknown ingredients of the model, which are also to be learned from the data, such as the rewards and state dynamics. However, many existing Bayesian approaches for learning the optimal decision-making strategy are based on unrealistic modelling assumptions and utilise approximate inference techniques. This raises doubts whether the benefits of Bayesian uncertainty quantification are fully realised or can be relied upon.
  We focus on infinite-horizon and undiscounted MDPs, with finite state and action spaces, and a terminal state. We provide a full Bayesian framework, from modelling to inference to decision-making. For modelling, we introduce a likelihood function with minimal assumptions for learning the optimal action-value function based on Bellman's optimality equations, analyse its properties, and clarify connections to existing works. For deterministic rewards, the likelihood is degenerate and we introduce artificial observation noise to relax it, in a controlled manner, to facilitate more efficient Monte Carlo-based inference. For inference, we propose an adaptive sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to both sample from and adjust the sequence of relaxed posterior distributions. For decision-making, we choose actions using samples from the posterior distribution over the optimal strategies. While commonly done, we provide new insight that clearly shows that it is a generalisation of Thompson sampling from multi-arm bandit problems. Finally, we evaluate our framework on the Deep Sea benchmark problem and demonstrate the exploration benefits of posterior sampling in MDPs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, but its classical cryptographic underpinnings are vulnerable to quantum attacks. This vulnerability is particularly critical in sensitive domains like healthcare. This paper introduces PQS-BFL (Post-Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning), a framework integrating post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with blockchain verification to secure FL against quantum adversaries. We employ ML-DSA-65 (a FIPS 204 standard candidate, formerly Dilithium) signatures to authenticate model updates and leverage optimized smart contracts for decentralized validation. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets (MNIST, SVHN, HAR) demonstrate that PQS-BFL achieves efficient cryptographic operations (average PQC sign time: 0.65 ms, verify time: 0.53 ms) with a fixed signature size of 3309 Bytes. Blockchain integration incurs a manageable overhead, with average transaction times around 4.8 s and gas usage per update averaging 1.72 x 10^6 units for PQC configurations. Crucially, the cryptographic overhead relative to transaction time remains minimal (around 0.01-0.02% for PQC with blockchain), confirming that PQC performance is not the bottleneck in blockchain-based FL. The system maintains competitive model accuracy (e.g., over 98.8% for MNIST with PQC) and scales effectively, with round times showing sublinear growth with increasing client numbers. Our open-source implementation and reproducible benchmarks validate the feasibility of deploying long-term, quantum-resistant security in practical FL systems.

Abstract: Robust navigation in diverse environments and domains requires both accurate state estimation and transparent decision making. We present PhysNav-DG, a novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.

Abstract: Inland water body segmentation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is an important task needed for several applications, such as flood mapping. While SAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images, differentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not straightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex geometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation. U-Net is a widely used deep learning model for land-water segmentation of SAR images. In practice, manual annotation is often used to generate the corresponding water masks as ground truth. Manual annotation of the images is prone to label noise owing to data poisoning attacks, especially due to complex geometry. In this work, we simulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model and study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our results indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before its performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role that the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness of the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial examples for robust training, are publicly available. (Github link - https://github.com/GVCL/IWSeg-SAR-Poison.git)

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks, with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned scientific applications.

Abstract: We present a faster algorithm to generate a warm start for sampling an arbitrary logconcave density specified by an evaluation oracle, leading to the first sub-cubic sampling algorithms for inputs in (near-)isotropic position. A long line of prior work incurred a warm-start penalty of at least linear in the dimension, hitting a cubic barrier, even for the special case of uniform sampling from convex bodies.
  Our improvement relies on two key ingredients of independent interest. (1) We show how to sample given a warm start in weaker notions of distance, in particular $q$-R\'enyi divergence for $q=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$, whereas previous analyses required stringent $\infty$-R\'enyi divergence (with the exception of Hit-and-Run, whose known mixing time is higher). This marks the first improvement in the required warmness since Lov\'asz and Simonovits (1991). (2) We refine and generalize the log-Sobolev inequality of Lee and Vempala (2018), originally established for isotropic logconcave distributions in terms of the diameter of the support, to logconcave distributions in terms of a geometric average of the support diameter and the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.

<title>Runtime Anomaly Detection for Drones: An Integrated Rule-Mining and Unsupervised-Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: UAVs, commonly referred to as drones, have witnessed a remarkable surge in popularity due to their versatile applications. These cyber-physical systems depend on multiple sensor inputs, such as cameras, GPS receivers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes, with faults potentially leading to physical instability and serious safety concerns. To mitigate such risks, anomaly detection has emerged as a crucial safeguarding mechanism, capable of identifying the physical manifestations of emerging issues and allowing operators to take preemptive action at runtime. Recent anomaly detection methods based on LSTM neural networks have shown promising results, but three challenges persist: the need for models that can generalise across the diverse mission profiles of drones; the need for interpretability, enabling operators to understand the nature of detected problems; and the need for capturing domain knowledge that is difficult to infer solely from log data. Motivated by these challenges, this paper introduces RADD, an integrated approach to anomaly detection in drones that combines rule mining and unsupervised learning. In particular, we leverage rules (or invariants) to capture expected relationships between sensors and actuators during missions, and utilise unsupervised learning techniques to cover more subtle relationships that the rules may have missed. We implement this approach using the ArduPilot drone software in the Gazebo simulator, utilising 44 rules derived across the main phases of drone missions, in conjunction with an ensemble of five unsupervised learning models. We find that our integrated approach successfully detects 93.84% of anomalies over six types of faults with a low false positive rate (2.33%), and can be deployed effectively at runtime. Furthermore, RADD outperforms a state-of-the-art LSTM-based method in detecting the different types of faults evaluated in our study.

Abstract: Modular self-reconfigurable satellites refer to satellite clusters composed of individual modular units capable of altering their configurations. The configuration changes enable the execution of diverse tasks and mission objectives. Existing path planning algorithms for reconfiguration often suffer from high computational complexity, poor generalization capability, and limited support for diverse target configurations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a goal-oriented reinforcement learning-based path planning algorithm. This algorithm is the first to address the challenge that previous reinforcement learning methods failed to overcome, namely handling multiple target configurations. Moreover, techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay and Invalid Action Masking are incorporated to overcome the significant obstacles posed by sparse rewards and invalid actions. Based on these designs, our model achieves a 95% and 73% success rate in reaching arbitrary target configurations in a modular satellite cluster composed of four and six units, respectively.

Abstract: We can approximate a constraint or an objective function that is uncertain or nonlinear with a neural network that we embed in the optimization model. This approach, which is known as constraint learning, faces the challenge that optimization models with neural network surrogates are harder to solve. Such difficulties have motivated studies on model reformulation, specialized optimization algorithms, and - to a lesser extent - pruning of the embedded networks. In this work, we double down on the use of surrogates by applying network pruning to produce a surrogate of the neural network itself. In the context of using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver to verify neural networks, we obtained faster adversarial perturbations for dense neural networks by using sparse surrogates, especially - and surprisingly - if not taking the time to finetune the sparse network to make up for the loss in accuracy. In other words, we show that a pruned network with bad classification performance can still be a good - and more efficient - surrogate.

Abstract: Individual treatment effect estimation has gained significant attention in recent data science literature. This work introduces the Double Neural Network (Double-NN) method to address this problem within the framework of extended fiducial inference (EFI). In the proposed method, deep neural networks are used to model the treatment and control effect functions, while an additional neural network is employed to estimate their parameters. The universal approximation capability of deep neural networks ensures the broad applicability of this method. Numerical results highlight the superior performance of the proposed Double-NN method compared to the conformal quantile regression (CQR) method in individual treatment effect estimation. From the perspective of statistical inference, this work advances the theory and methodology for statistical inference of large models. Specifically, it is theoretically proven that the proposed method permits the model size to increase with the sample size $n$ at a rate of $O(n^{\zeta})$ for some $0 \leq \zeta<1$, while still maintaining proper quantification of uncertainty in the model parameters. This result marks a significant improvement compared to the range $0\leq \zeta < \frac{1}{2}$ required by the classical central limit theorem. Furthermore, this work provides a rigorous framework for quantifying the uncertainty of deep neural networks under the neural scaling law, representing a substantial contribution to the statistical understanding of large-scale neural network models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to various real-world applications, leveraging massive, web-sourced datasets like Common Crawl, C4, and FineWeb for pretraining. While these datasets provide linguistic data essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives. Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for content filtering. Additionally, we create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. Upon publishing, we will also opensource our model signal on the entire C4 dataset. Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.

Abstract: Recent progress in Meta-Black-Box-Optimization (MetaBBO) has demonstrated that using RL to learn a meta-level policy for dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) over an optimization task distribution could significantly enhance the performance of the low-level BBO algorithm. However, the online learning paradigms in existing works makes the efficiency of MetaBBO problematic. To address this, we propose an offline learning-based MetaBBO framework in this paper, termed Q-Mamba, to attain both effectiveness and efficiency in MetaBBO. Specifically, we first transform DAC task into long-sequence decision process. This allows us further introduce an effective Q-function decomposition mechanism to reduce the learning difficulty within the intricate algorithm configuration space. Under this setting, we propose three novel designs to meta-learn DAC policy from offline data: we first propose a novel collection strategy for constructing offline DAC experiences dataset with balanced exploration and exploitation. We then establish a decomposition-based Q-loss that incorporates conservative Q-learning to promote stable offline learning from the offline dataset. To further improve the offline learning efficiency, we equip our work with a Mamba architecture which helps long-sequence learning effectiveness and efficiency by selective state model and hardware-aware parallel scan respectively. Through extensive benchmarking, we observe that Q-Mamba achieves competitive or even superior performance to prior online/offline baselines, while significantly improving the training efficiency of existing online baselines. We provide sourcecodes of Q-Mamba at https://github.com/MetaEvo/Q-Mamba.

Abstract: Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.

Abstract: Adapting vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks with pseudolabels has gained increasing attention. A major obstacle is that the pseudolabels generated by VLMs tend to be imbalanced, leading to inferior performance. While existing methods have explored various strategies to address this, the underlying causes of imbalance remain insufficiently investigated. To fill this gap, we delve into imbalanced pseudolabels and identify two primary contributing factors: concept mismatch and concept confusion. To mitigate these two issues, we propose a novel framework incorporating concept alignment and confusion-aware calibrated margin mechanisms. The core of our approach lies in enhancing underperforming classes and promoting balanced predictions across categories, thus mitigating imbalance. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets with three learning paradigms demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the accuracy and balance of pseudolabels, achieving a relative improvement of 6.29% over the SoTA method.

Abstract: We propose the Compact Clustering Attention (COCA) layer, an effective building block that introduces a hierarchical strategy for object-centric representation learning, while solving the unsupervised object discovery task on single images. COCA is an attention-based clustering module capable of extracting object-centric representations from multi-object scenes, when cascaded into a bottom-up hierarchical network architecture, referred to as COCA-Net. At its core, COCA utilizes a novel clustering algorithm that leverages the physical concept of compactness, to highlight distinct object centroids in a scene, providing a spatial inductive bias. Thanks to this strategy, COCA-Net generates high-quality segmentation masks on both the decoder side and, notably, the encoder side of its pipeline. Additionally, COCA-Net is not bound by a predetermined number of object masks that it generates and handles the segmentation of background elements better than its competitors. We demonstrate COCA-Net's segmentation performance on six widely adopted datasets, achieving superior or competitive results against the state-of-the-art models across nine different evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are large-scale, pre-trained models that serve as general-purpose backbones for various computer vision tasks. As VFMs' popularity grows, there is an increasing interest in understanding their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks. However, VFMs typically produce low-resolution features, limiting their direct applicability in this context. One way to tackle this limitation is by employing a task-agnostic feature upsampling module that refines VFM features resolution. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we investigate Interactive Segmentation (IS) as a novel benchmark for evaluating feature upsampling methods on VFMs. Due to its inherent multimodal input, consisting of an image and a set of user-defined clicks, as well as its dense mask output, IS creates a challenging environment that demands comprehensive visual scene understanding. Our benchmarking experiments show that selecting appropriate upsampling strategies significantly improves VFM features quality. The code is released at https://github.com/havrylovv/iSegProbe

Abstract: Solving non-convex resource allocation problems poses significant challenges in wireless communication systems, often beyond the capability of traditional optimization techniques. To address this issue, we propose LLM-OptiRA, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect and transform non-convex components into solvable forms, enabling fully automated resolution of non-convex resource allocation problems in wireless communication systems. LLM-OptiRA not only simplifies problem-solving by reducing reliance on expert knowledge, but also integrates error correction and feasibility validation mechanisms to ensure robustness. Experimental results show that LLM-OptiRA achieves an execution rate of 96% and a success rate of 80% on GPT-4, significantly outperforming baseline approaches in complex optimization tasks across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization is a powerful tool for many machine learning problems, such as hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. Estimating hypergradients (also known as implicit gradients) is crucial for developing gradient-based methods for bilevel optimization. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient technique for incorporating curvature information into the approximation of hypergradients and present a novel algorithmic framework based on the resulting enhanced hypergradient computation. We provide convergence rate guarantees for the proposed framework in both deterministic and stochastic scenarios, particularly showing improved computational complexity over popular gradient-based methods in the deterministic setting. This improvement in complexity arises from a careful exploitation of the hypergradient structure and the inexact Newton method. In addition to the theoretical speedup, numerical experiments demonstrate the significant practical performance benefits of incorporating curvature information.

Abstract: Heterogeneous deep learning systems (DLS) such as GPUs and ASICs have been widely deployed in industrial data centers, which requires to develop multiple low-level tensor programs for different platforms. An attractive solution to relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one platform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question.
  We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs) and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely, we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined meta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation, efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code snippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters and sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor programs.

Abstract: Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social simulation. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) that strategically selects from four thinking modes (intuitive reaction $\rightarrow$ deep contemplation) based on real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's fixed-depth approach

Abstract: Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants. Constrained by a fixed budget, decision-makers draft a squad whose players are expected to perform well in the upcoming weeks to maximize total points. This paper proposes novel deterministic and robust integer programming models that select the optimal starting eleven and the captain. A new hybrid scoring metric is constructed using an interpretable artificial intelligence framework and underlying match performance data. Several objective functions and estimation techniques are introduced for the programming model. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to approach fantasy football through this lens. The models' performance is evaluated using data from the 2023/24 Premier League season. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method achieved the highest score while maintaining consistent performance. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation, the strategic choice of averaging techniques for estimating cost vectors, and the proposed hybrid approach are shown to be effective during the out-of-sample period. This paper also provides a thorough analysis of the optimal formations and players selected by the models, offering valuable insights into effective fantasy football strategies.

Abstract: Time series clustering is an unsupervised learning method for classifying time series data into groups with similar behavior. It is used in applications such as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several time series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four decades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or association dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new dissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC), which combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest element-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity. It is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated and compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the RDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different seasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by clustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption time series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics.

Abstract: We revisit the Bayesian Black-Litterman (BL) portfolio model and remove its reliance on subjective investor views. Classical BL requires an investor "view": a forecast vector $q$ and its uncertainty matrix $\Omega$ that describe how much a chosen portfolio should outperform the market. Our key idea is to treat $(q,\Omega)$ as latent variables and learn them from market data within a single Bayesian network. Consequently, the resulting posterior estimation admits closed-form expression, enabling fast inference and stable portfolio weights. Building on these, we propose two mechanisms to capture how features interact with returns: shared-latent parametrization and feature-influenced views; both recover classical BL and Markowitz portfolios as special cases. Empirically, on 30-year Dow-Jones and 20-year sector-ETF data, we improve Sharpe ratios by 50% and cut turnover by 55% relative to Markowitz and the index baselines. This work turns BL into a fully data-driven, view-free, and coherent Bayesian framework for portfolio optimization.

Abstract: A decision tree is an easy-to-understand tool that has been widely used for classification tasks. On the one hand, due to privacy concerns, there has been an urgent need to create privacy-preserving classifiers that conceal the user's input from the classifier. On the other hand, with the rise of cloud computing, data owners are keen to reduce risk by outsourcing their model, but want security guarantees that third parties cannot steal their decision tree model. To address these issues, Joye and Salehi introduced a theoretical protocol that efficiently evaluates decision trees while maintaining privacy by leveraging their comparison protocol that is resistant to timing attacks. However, their approach was not only inefficient but also prone to side-channel attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new decision tree inference protocol in which the model is shared and evaluated among multiple entities. We partition our decision tree model by each level to be stored in a new entity we refer to as a "level-site." Utilizing this approach, we were able to gain improved average run time for classifier evaluation for a non-complete tree, while also having strong mitigations against side-channel attacks.

Abstract: Building models responsive to input prompts represents a transformative shift in machine learning. This paradigm holds significant potential for robotics problems, such as targeted manipulation amidst clutter. In this work, we present a novel approach to combine promptable foundation models with reinforcement learning (RL), enabling robots to perform dexterous manipulation tasks in a prompt-responsive manner. Existing methods struggle to link high-level commands with fine-grained dexterous control. We address this gap with a memory-augmented student-teacher learning framework. We use the Segment-Anything 2 (SAM 2) model as a perception backbone to infer an object of interest from user prompts. While detections are imperfect, their temporal sequence provides rich information for implicit state estimation by memory-augmented models. Our approach successfully learns prompt-responsive policies, demonstrated in picking objects from cluttered scenes. Videos and code are available at https://memory-student-teacher.github.io

Abstract: We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature.

Abstract: In regions lacking medically certified causes of death, verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical and widely used tool to ascertain the cause of death through interviews with caregivers. Data collected by VAs are often analyzed using probabilistic algorithms. The performance of these algorithms often degrades due to distributional shift across populations. Most existing VA algorithms rely on centralized training, requiring full access to training data for joint modeling. This is often infeasible due to privacy and logistical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) framework that avoids data sharing across multiple training sources. Our method enables reliable individual-level cause-of-death classification and population-level quantification of cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs), in a target domain with limited or no local labeled data. The proposed framework is modular, computationally efficient, and compatible with a wide range of existing VA algorithms as candidate models, facilitating flexible deployment in real-world mortality surveillance systems. We validate the performance of BFL through extensive experiments on two real-world VA datasets under varying levels of distribution shift. Our results show that BFL significantly outperforms the base models built on a single domain and achieves comparable or better performance compared to joint modeling.

Abstract: Dielectric response (DR) of insulating materials is key input information for designing electrical insulation systems and defining safe operating conditions of various HV devices. In dielectric materials, different polarization and conduction processes occur at different time scales, making it challenging to physically interpret raw measured data. To analyze DR measurement results, equivalent circuit models (ECMs) are commonly used, reducing the complexity of the physical system to a number of circuit elements that capture the dominant response. This paper examines the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for inverse modeling of DR in time domain using parallel RC circuits. To assess their performance, we test PINNs on synthetic data generated from analytical solutions of corresponding ECMs, incorporating Gaussian noise to simulate measurement errors. Our results show that PINNs are highly effective at solving well-conditioned inverse problems, accurately estimating up to five unknown RC parameters with minimal requirements on neural network size, training duration, and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, we extend the ECMs to incorporate temperature dependence and demonstrate that PINNs can accurately recover embedded, nonlinear temperature functions from noisy DR data sampled at different temperatures. This case study in modeling DR in time domain presents a solution with wide-ranging potential applications in disciplines relying on ECMs, utilizing the latest technology in machine learning for scientific computation.

<title>Smooth Integer Encoding via Integral Balance</title>

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for encoding integers using smooth real-valued functions whose integral properties implicitly reflect discrete quantities. In contrast to classical representations, where the integer appears as an explicit parameter, our approach encodes the number N in the set of natural numbers through the cumulative balance of a smooth function f_N(t), constructed from localized Gaussian bumps with alternating and decaying coefficients. The total integral I(N) converges to zero as N tends to infinity, and the integer can be recovered as the minimal point of near-cancellation.
  This method enables continuous and differentiable representations of discrete states, supports recovery through spline-based or analytical inversion, and extends naturally to multidimensional tuples (N1, N2, ...). We analyze the structure and convergence of the encoding series, demonstrate numerical construction of the integral map I(N), and develop procedures for integer recovery via numerical inversion. The resulting framework opens a path toward embedding discrete logic within continuous optimization pipelines, machine learning architectures, and smooth symbolic computation.

Abstract: Embedding layers in transformer-based NLP models typically account for the largest share of model parameters, scaling with vocabulary size but not yielding performance gains proportional to scale. We propose an alternative approach in which token embedding vectors are first generated deterministically, directly from the token IDs using a Fourier expansion of their normalized values, followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) that captures higher-order interactions. We train standard transformers and our architecture on natural language inference tasks (SNLI and MNLI), and evaluate zero-shot performance on sentence textual similarity (STS-B). Our results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance using significantly fewer parameters, trains faster, and operates effectively without the need for dropout. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential for scalable, memory-efficient language models and motivates further large-scale experimentation based on our findings.

Abstract: This study explores the performance of a random Gaussian smoothing zeroth-order (ZO) scheme for minimising quasar-convex (QC) and strongly quasar-convex (SQC) functions in both unconstrained and constrained settings. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the ZO algorithm's convergence to a global minimum along with its complexity when applied to both QC and SQC functions. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained case. Specifically, we show the complexity bounds and the convergence of the algorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme. Theoretical findings are illustrated through investigating the performance of the algorithm applied to a range of problems in machine learning and optimisation. Specifically, we observe scenarios where the ZO method outperforms gradient descent. We provide a possible explanation for this phenomenon.

Abstract: The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has exposed the inefficiency of conventional von Neumann architectures, where frequent data transfers between compute units and memory create significant energy and latency bottlenecks. Analog Computing-in-Memory (ACIM) addresses this challenge by performing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations directly in the memory arrays, substantially reducing data movement. However, designing robust ACIM accelerators requires accurate modeling of device- and circuit-level non-idealities. In this work, we present NeuroSim V1.5, introducing several key advances: (1) seamless integration with TensorRT's post-training quantization flow enabling support for more neural networks including transformers, (2) a flexible noise injection methodology built on pre-characterized statistical models, making it straightforward to incorporate data from SPICE simulations or silicon measurements, (3) expanded device support including emerging non-volatile capacitive memories, and (4) up to 6.5x faster runtime than NeuroSim V1.4 through optimized behavioral simulation. The combination of these capabilities uniquely enables systematic design space exploration across both accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics. Through multiple case studies, we demonstrate optimization of critical design parameters while maintaining network accuracy. By bridging high-fidelity noise modeling with efficient simulation, NeuroSim V1.5 advances the design and validation of next-generation ACIM accelerators. All NeuroSim versions are available open-source at https://github.com/neurosim/NeuroSim.

<title>Sparse Ellipsoidal Radial Basis Function Network for Point Cloud Surface Representation</title>

Abstract: Point cloud surface representation is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and vision. This paper presents a machine learning approach for approximating the signed distance function (SDF) of a point cloud using sparse ellipsoidal radial basis function networks, enabling a compact and accurate surface representation. Given the SDF values defined on the grid points constructed from the point cloud, our method approximates the SDF accurately with as few ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs) as possible, i.e., represent the SDF of a point cloud by sparse ERBFs. To balance sparsity and approximation precision, a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy is introduced, which adaptively adds the regularization terms and jointly optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of ERBFs. To improve computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure is employed, restricting function calculations to points near each Gaussian kernel center. The computations for each kernel are further parallelized on CUDA, which significantly improves the optimization speed. Additionally, a hierarchical octree-based refinement strategy is designed for training. Specifically, the initialization and optimization of network parameters are conducted using coarse grid points in the octree lattice structure. Subsequently, fine lattice points are progressively incorporated to accelerate model convergence and enhance training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous sparse representation approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. The corresponding code is publicly available at https://github.com/lianbobo/SE-RBFNet.git.

Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table. For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks, we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of test accuracy.

Abstract: Email spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems, essential for maintaining productivity, security, and user experience. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while effective in static settings, face significant limitations in adapting to evolving spam tactics, addressing class imbalance, and managing data scarcity. These challenges necessitate innovative approaches that reduce dependency on extensive labeled datasets and frequent retraining. This study investigates the effectiveness of Zero-Shot Learning using FLAN-T5, combined with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT for email spam detection. By employing BERT to preprocess and extract critical information from email content, and FLAN-T5 to classify emails in a Zero-Shot framework, the proposed approach aims to address the limitations of traditional spam detection systems. The integration of FLAN-T5 and BERT enables robust spam detection without relying on extensive labeled datasets or frequent retraining, making it highly adaptable to unseen spam patterns and adversarial environments. This research highlights the potential of leveraging zero-shot learning and NLPs for scalable and efficient spam detection, providing insights into their capability to address the dynamic and challenging nature of spam detection tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning has become a hot research topic in natural language processing. Existing works usually aim at constraining the orientation distribution of the representations of positive and negative samples in the high-dimensional semantic space in contrastive learning, but the semantic representation tensor possesses both modulus and orientation features, and the existing works ignore the modulus feature of the representations and cause insufficient contrastive learning. % Therefore, we firstly propose a training objective that aims at modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen the alignment between the positive samples in contrastive learning. Therefore, we first propose a training objective that is designed to impose modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen the alignment between positive samples in contrastive learning. Then, the BERT-like model suffers from the phenomenon of sinking attention, leading to a lack of attention to CLS tokens that aggregate semantic information. In response, we propose a cross-attention structure among the twin-tower ensemble models to enhance the model's attention to CLS token and optimize the quality of CLS Pooling. Combining the above two motivations, we propose a new \textbf{J}oint \textbf{T}ensor representation modulus constraint and \textbf{C}ross-attention unsupervised contrastive learning \textbf{S}entence \textbf{E}mbedding representation framework JTCSE, which we evaluate in seven semantic text similarity computation tasks, and the experimental results show that JTCSE's twin-tower ensemble model and single-tower distillation model outperform the other baselines and become the current SOTA. In addition, we have conducted an extensive zero-shot downstream task evaluation, which shows that JTCSE outperforms other baselines overall on more than 130 tasks.

<title>SuperEdit: Rectifying and Facilitating Supervision for Instruction-Based Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps, independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19% improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x smaller model size.

<title>RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for various building environments, these models often require extensive data collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superb-quality images, but its accessibility is limited by high costs, posing challenges for patients requiring longitudinal care. Low-field MRI provides affordable imaging with low-cost devices but is hindered by long scans and degraded image quality, including low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tissue contrast. We propose a novel healthcare paradigm: using deep learning to extract personalized features from past standard high-field MRI scans and harnessing them to enable accelerated, enhanced-quality follow-up scans with low-cost systems. To overcome the SNR and contrast differences, we introduce ViT-Fuser, a feature-fusion vision transformer that learns features from past scans, e.g. those stored in standard DICOM CDs. We show that \textit{a single prior scan is sufficient}, and this scan can come from various MRI vendors, field strengths, and pulse sequences. Experiments with four datasets, including glioblastoma data, low-field ($50mT$), and ultra-low-field ($6.5mT$) data, demonstrate that ViT-Fuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing enhanced-quality images from accelerated low-field scans, with robustness to out-of-distribution data. Our freely available framework thus enables rapid, diagnostic-quality, low-cost imaging for wide healthcare applications.

Abstract: Computational chemistry tools are widely used to study the behaviour of chemical phenomena. Yet, the complexity of these tools can make them inaccessible to non-specialists and challenging even for experts. In this work, we introduce El Agente Q, an LLM-based multi-agent system that dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language user prompts. The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging >87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs. Together, these capabilities lay the foundation for increasingly autonomous and accessible quantum chemistry.

Abstract: We introduce Corr2Distrib, the first correspondence-based method which estimates a 6D camera pose distribution from an RGB image, explaining the observations. Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities, leading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this problem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP Challenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose solution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not straightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities drastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these ambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first learns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's surface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation enables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D correspondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution using PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex non-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art solutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from an RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models is a popular computational tool to generate new data samples. It utilizes a forward diffusion process that add noise to the data distribution and then use a reverse process to remove noises to produce samples from the data distribution. However, when the empirical data distribution consists of $n$ data point, using the empirical diffusion model will necessarily produce one of the existing data points. This is often referred to as the memorization effect, which is usually resolved by sophisticated machine learning procedures in the current literature. This work shows that the memorization problem can be resolved by a simple inertia update step at the end of the empirical diffusion model simulation. Our inertial diffusion model requires only the empirical diffusion model score function and it does not require any further training. We show that choosing the inertia diffusion model sample distribution is an $O\left(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}}\right)$ Wasserstein-1 approximation of a data distribution lying on a $C^2$ manifold of dimension $d$. Since this estimate is significant smaller the Wasserstein1 distance between population and empirical distributions, it rigorously shows the inertial diffusion model produces new data samples. Remarkably, this upper bound is completely free of the ambient space dimension, since there is no training involved. Our analysis utilizes the fact that the inertial diffusion model samples are approximately distributed as the Gaussian kernel density estimator on the manifold. This reveals an interesting connection between diffusion model and manifold learning.

By integrating complex functions into miniaturized neural devices, these systems unlock significant opportunities for personalized assistive technologies and adaptive therapeutic interventions. Leveraging high-density neural recordings, on-site signal processing, and machine learning (ML), these interfaces extract critical features, identify disease neuro-markers, and enable accurate, low-latency neural decoding. This integration facilitates real-time interpretation of neural signals, adaptive modulation of brain activity, and efficient control of assistive devices. Moreover, the synergy between neural interfaces and ML has paved the way for self-sufficient, ubiquitous platforms capable of operating in diverse environments with minimal hardware costs and external dependencies. In this work, we review recent advancements in AI-driven decoding algorithms and energy-efficient System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms for next-generation miniaturized neural devices. These innovations highlight the potential for developing intelligent neural interfaces, addressing critical challenges in scalability, reliability, interpretability, and user adaptability.

Abstract: Partial hand amputations significantly affect the physical and psychosocial well-being of individuals, yet intuitive control of externally powered prostheses remains an open challenge. To address this gap, we developed a force-controlled prosthetic finger activated by electromyography (EMG) signals. The prototype, constructed around a wrist brace, functions as a supernumerary finger placed near the index, allowing for early-stage evaluation on unimpaired subjects. A neural network-based model was then implemented to estimate fingertip forces from EMG inputs, allowing for online adjustment of the prosthetic finger grip strength. The force estimation model was validated through experiments with ten participants, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting forces. Additionally, online trials with four users wearing the prosthesis exhibited precise control over the device. Our findings highlight the potential of using EMG-based force estimation to enhance the functionality of prosthetic fingers.

Abstract: Reasoning tasks are crucial in many domains, especially in science and engineering. Although large language models (LLMs) have made progress in reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and least-to-most prompting, these approaches still do not effectively scale to complex problems in either their performance or execution time. Moreover, they often require additional supervision for each new task, such as in-context examples. In this work, we introduce Recursive Decomposition with Dependencies (RDD), a scalable divide-and-conquer method for solving reasoning problems that requires less supervision than prior approaches. Our method can be directly applied to a new problem class even in the absence of any task-specific guidance. Furthermore, RDD supports sub-task dependencies, allowing for ordered execution of sub-tasks, as well as an error recovery mechanism that can correct mistakes made in previous steps. We evaluate our approach on two benchmarks with six difficulty levels each and in two in-context settings: one with task-specific examples and one without. Our results demonstrate that RDD outperforms other methods in a compute-matched setting as task complexity increases, while also being more computationally efficient.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.

Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable and interpretable framework for lane-wise highway traffic anomaly detection, leveraging multi-modal time series data extracted from surveillance cameras. Unlike traditional sensor-dependent methods, our approach uses AI-powered vision models to extract lane-specific features, including vehicle count, occupancy, and truck percentage, without relying on costly hardware or complex road modeling. We introduce a novel dataset containing 73,139 lane-wise samples, annotated with four classes of expert-validated anomalies: three traffic-related anomalies (lane blockage and recovery, foreign object intrusion, and sustained congestion) and one sensor-related anomaly (camera angle shift). Our multi-branch detection system integrates deep learning, rule-based logic, and machine learning to improve robustness and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-world intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: This paper focuses on applying entropic mirror descent to solve linear systems, where the main challenge for the convergence analysis stems from the unboundedness of the domain. To overcome this without imposing restrictive assumptions, we introduce a variant of Polyak-type stepsizes. Along the way, we strengthen the bound for $\ell_1$-norm implicit bias, obtain sublinear and linear convergence results, and generalize the convergence result to arbitrary convex $L$-smooth functions. We also propose an alternative method that avoids exponentiation, resembling the original Hadamard descent, but with provable convergence.

Abstract: Gaze may enhance the robustness of lie detectors but remains under-studied. This study evaluated the efficacy of AI models (using fixations, saccades, blinks, and pupil size) for detecting deception in Concealed Information Tests across two datasets. The first, collected with Eyelink 1000, contains gaze data from a computerized experiment where 87 participants revealed, concealed, or faked the value of a previously selected card. The second, collected with Pupil Neon, involved 36 participants performing a similar task but facing an experimenter. XGBoost achieved accuracies up to 74% in a binary classification task (Revealing vs. Concealing) and 49% in a more challenging three-classification task (Revealing vs. Concealing vs. Faking). Feature analysis identified saccade number, duration, amplitude, and maximum pupil size as the most important for deception prediction. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using gaze and AI to enhance lie detectors and encourage future research that may improve on this.

Abstract: Grasp pose detection in cluttered, real-world environments remains a significant challenge due to noisy and incomplete sensory data combined with complex object geometries. This paper introduces Grasp the Graph 2.0 (GtG 2.0) method, a lightweight yet highly effective hypothesis-and-test robotics grasping framework which leverages an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks for efficient geometric reasoning from point cloud data. Building on the success of GtG 1.0, which demonstrated the potential of Graph Neural Networks for grasp detection but was limited by assumptions of complete, noise-free point clouds and 4-Dof grasping, GtG 2.0 employs a conventional Grasp Pose Generator to efficiently produce 7-Dof grasp candidates. Candidates are assessed with an ensemble Graph Neural Network model which includes points within the gripper jaws (inside points) and surrounding contextual points (outside points). This improved representation boosts grasp detection performance over previous methods using the same generator. GtG 2.0 shows up to a 35% improvement in Average Precision on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark compared to hypothesis-and-test and Graph Neural Network-based methods, ranking it among the top three frameworks. Experiments with a 3-Dof Delta Parallel robot and Kinect-v1 camera show a success rate of 91% and a clutter completion rate of 100%, demonstrating its flexibility and reliability.

<title>Technical Report: Evaluating Goal Drift in Language Model Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, their robust adherence to human-assigned objectives becomes crucial for safe operation. When these agents operate independently for extended periods without human oversight, even initially well-specified goals may gradually shift. Detecting and measuring goal drift - an agent's tendency to deviate from its original objective over time - presents significant challenges, as goals can shift gradually, causing only subtle behavioral changes. This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing goal drift in LM agents. In our experiments, agents are first explicitly given a goal through their system prompt, then exposed to competing objectives through environmental pressures. We demonstrate that while the best-performing agent (a scaffolded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet) maintains nearly perfect goal adherence for more than 100,000 tokens in our most difficult evaluation setting, all evaluated models exhibit some degree of goal drift. We also find that goal drift correlates with models' increasing susceptibility to pattern-matching behaviors as the context length grows.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across general domains, their effectiveness in real-world clinical practice remains limited. This is likely due to their insufficient exposure to real-world clinical data during training, as such data is typically not included due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose enhancing the clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging real-world clinical data. We constructed reasoning-intensive questions from a nationwide sepsis registry and fine-tuned Phi-4 on these questions using reinforcement learning, resulting in C-Reason. C-Reason exhibited strong clinical reasoning capabilities on the in-domain test set, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics and expert evaluations. Furthermore, its enhanced reasoning capabilities generalized to a sepsis dataset involving different tasks and patient cohorts, an open-ended consultations on antibiotics use task, and other diseases. Future research should focus on training LLMs with large-scale, multi-disease clinical datasets to develop more powerful, general-purpose clinical reasoning models.

Abstract: Formal mathematical reasoning remains a critical challenge for artificial intelligence, hindered by limitations of existing benchmarks in scope and scale. To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark comprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad challenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g., algebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete mathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates: (1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization, (2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering strategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert annotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification while ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant limitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under practical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling in algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation tactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between natural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought reasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning introduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We believe that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs. This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data. Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet, a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.

<title>Adaptive Bidding Policies for First-Price Auctions with Budget Constraints under Non-stationarity</title>

Abstract: We study how a budget-constrained bidder should learn to adaptively bid in repeated first-price auctions to maximize her cumulative payoff. This problem arose due to an industry-wide shift from second-price auctions to first-price auctions in display advertising recently, which renders truthful bidding (i.e., always bidding one's private value) no longer optimal. We propose a simple dual-gradient-descent-based bidding policy that maintains a dual variable for budget constraint as the bidder consumes her budget. In analysis, we consider two settings regarding the bidder's knowledge of her private values in the future: (i) an uninformative setting where all the distributional knowledge (can be non-stationary) is entirely unknown to the bidder, and (ii) an informative setting where a prediction of the budget allocation in advance. We characterize the performance loss (or regret) relative to an optimal policy with complete information on the stochasticity. For uninformative setting, We show that the regret is \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) plus a variation term that reflects the non-stationarity of the value distributions, and this is of optimal order. We then show that we can get rid of the variation term with the help of the prediction; specifically, the regret is \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) plus the prediction error term in the informative setting.

Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own", into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second, we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

Abstract: Teleoperating humanoid robots in a whole-body manner marks a fundamental step toward developing general-purpose robotic intelligence, with human motion providing an ideal interface for controlling all degrees of freedom. Yet, most current humanoid teleoperation systems fall short of enabling coordinated whole-body behavior, typically limiting themselves to isolated locomotion or manipulation tasks. We present the Teleoperated Whole-Body Imitation System (TWIST), a system for humanoid teleoperation through whole-body motion imitation. We first generate reference motion clips by retargeting human motion capture data to the humanoid robot. We then develop a robust, adaptive, and responsive whole-body controller using a combination of reinforcement learning and behavior cloning (RL+BC). Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how incorporating privileged future motion frames and real-world motion capture (MoCap) data improves tracking accuracy. TWIST enables real-world humanoid robots to achieve unprecedented, versatile, and coordinated whole-body motor skills--spanning whole-body manipulation, legged manipulation, locomotion, and expressive movement--using a single unified neural network controller.

Abstract: There is a recent growing interest in applying Deep Learning techniques to tabular data, in order to replicate the success of other Artificial Intelligence areas in this structured domain. Specifically interesting is the case in which tabular data have a time dependence, such as, for instance financial transactions. However, the heterogeneity of the tabular values, in which categorical elements are mixed with numerical items, makes this adaptation difficult. In this paper we propose a Transformer architecture to represent heterogeneous time-dependent tabular data, in which numerical features are represented using a set of frequency functions and the whole network is uniformly trained with a unique loss function.

Abstract: The intersection of Foundation Model (FM) and Federated Learning (FL) presents a unique opportunity to unlock new possibilities for real-world applications. On the one hand, FL, as a collaborative learning paradigm, help address challenges in FM development by expanding data availability, enabling computation sharing, facilitating the collaborative development of FMs, tackling continuous data update, avoiding FM monopoly, response delay and FM service down. On the other hand, FM, equipped with pre-trained knowledge and exceptional performance, can serve as a robust starting point for FL. It can also generate synthetic data to enrich data diversity and enhance overall performance of FL. Meanwhile, FM unlocks new sharing paradigm and multi-task and multi-modality capabilities for FL. By examining the interplay between FL and FM, this paper presents the motivations, challenges, and future directions of empowering FL with FM and empowering FM with FL. We hope that this work provides a good foundation to inspire future research efforts to drive advancements in both fields.

Abstract: In recent years, Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Emotion Recognition (ER) have been increasingly popular in the Bangla language, which is the seventh most spoken language throughout the entire world. However, the language is structurally complicated, which makes this field arduous to extract emotions in an accurate manner. Several distinct approaches such as the extraction of positive and negative sentiments as well as multiclass emotions, have been implemented in this field of study. Nevertheless, the extraction of multiple sentiments is an almost untouched area in this language. Which involves identifying several feelings based on a single piece of text. Therefore, this study demonstrates a thorough method for constructing an annotated corpus based on scrapped data from Facebook to bridge the gaps in this subject area to overcome the challenges. To make this annotation more fruitful, the context-based approach has been used. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a well-known methodology of transformers, have been shown the best results of all methods implemented. Finally, a web application has been developed to demonstrate the performance of the pre-trained top-performer model (BERT) for multi-label ER in Bangla.

Abstract: Sharpness, a geometric measure in the parameter space that reflects the flatness of the loss landscape, has long been studied for its potential connections to neural network behavior. While sharpness is often associated with generalization, recent work highlights inconsistencies in this relationship, leaving its true significance unclear. In this paper, we investigate how sharpness influences the local geometric features of neural representations in feature space, offering a new perspective on its role. We introduce this problem and study three measures for compression: the Local Volumetric Ratio (LVR), based on volume compression, the Maximum Local Sensitivity (MLS), based on sensitivity to input changes, and the Local Dimensionality, based on how uniform the sensitivity is on different directions. We show that LVR and MLS correlate with the flatness of the loss around the local minima; and that this correlation is predicted by a relatively simple mathematical relationship: a flatter loss corresponds to a lower upper bound on the compression metrics of neural representations. Our work builds upon the linear stability insight by Ma and Ying, deriving inequalities between various compression metrics and quantities involving sharpness. Our inequalities readily extend to reparametrization-invariant sharpness as well. Through empirical experiments on various feedforward, convolutional, and transformer architectures, we find that our inequalities predict a consistently positive correlation between local representation compression and sharpness.

Abstract: The capability of generalization is a cornerstone for the success of modern learning systems. For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes AdvDIFFormer, a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.

Abstract: To defend against privacy leakage of user data, differential privacy is widely used in federated learning, but it is not free. The addition of noise randomly disrupts the semantic integrity of the model and this disturbance accumulates with increased communication rounds. In this paper, we introduce a novel federated learning framework with rigorous privacy guarantees, named FedCEO, designed to strike a trade-off between model utility and user privacy by letting clients ''Collaborate with Each Other''. Specifically, we perform efficient tensor low-rank proximal optimization on stacked local model parameters at the server, demonstrating its capability to flexibly truncate high-frequency components in spectral space. This capability implies that our FedCEO can effectively recover the disrupted semantic information by smoothing the global semantic space for different privacy settings and continuous training processes. Moreover, we improve the SOTA utility-privacy trade-off bound by order of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the input dimension. We illustrate our theoretical results with experiments on representative datasets and observe significant performance improvements and strict privacy guarantees under different privacy settings. The code is available at https://github.com/6lyc/FedCEO_Collaborate-with-Each-Other.

Abstract: Existing models encounter bottlenecks in balancing performance and computational efficiency when modeling long sequences. Although the state space model (SSM) has achieved remarkable success in handling long sequence tasks, it still faces the problem of large number of parameters. In order to further improve the efficiency of SSM, we propose a new state space layer based on multiple-input multiple-output SSM, called efficient SSM (eSSM). Our eSSM is built on the convolutional representation of multi-input and multi-input (MIMO) SSM. We propose a variety of effective strategies to improve the computational efficiency. The diagonalization of the system matrix first decouples the original system. Then a fast tensor convolution is proposed based on the fast Fourier transform. In addition, the block diagonalization of the SSM further reduces the model parameters and improves the model flexibility. Extensive experimental results show that the performance of the proposed model on multiple databases matches the performance of state-of-the-art models, such as S4, and is significantly better than Transformers and LSTM. In the model efficiency benchmark, the parameters of eSSM are only 12.89\% of LSTM and 13.24\% of Mamba. The training speed of eSSM is 3.94 times faster than LSTM and 1.35 times faster than Mamba.

<title>REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning dynamic functional connectivity for distinguishing phenotypes from human brain networks. However, obtaining extensive labeled clinical data for training is often resource-intensive, making practical application difficult. Leveraging unlabeled data thus becomes crucial for representation learning in a label-scarce setting. Although generative self-supervised learning techniques, especially masked autoencoders, have shown promising results in representation learning in various domains, their application to dynamic graphs for dynamic functional connectivity remains underexplored, facing challenges in capturing high-level semantic representations. Here, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Joint Embedding Masked Autoencoder (ST-JEMA), drawing inspiration from the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) in computer vision. ST-JEMA employs a JEPA-inspired strategy for reconstructing dynamic graphs, which enables the learning of higher-level semantic representations considering temporal perspectives, addressing the challenges in fMRI data representation learning. Utilizing the large-scale UK Biobank dataset for self-supervised learning, ST-JEMA shows exceptional representation learning performance on dynamic functional connectivity demonstrating superiority over previous methods in predicting phenotypes and psychiatric diagnoses across eight benchmark fMRI datasets even with limited samples and effectiveness of temporal reconstruction on missing data scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of our approach as a robust representation learning method for leveraging label-scarce fMRI data.

Abstract: Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graphs (HGs) effectively model complex relationships in the real world through multi-type nodes and edges. In recent years, inspired by self-supervised learning (SSL), contrastive learning (CL)-based Heterogeneous Graphs Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown great potential in utilizing data augmentation and contrastive discriminators for downstream tasks. However, data augmentation remains limited due to the graph data's integrity. Furthermore, the contrastive discriminators suffer from sampling bias and lack local heterogeneous information. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Contrastive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GC-HGNN). Specifically, we propose a heterogeneous graph generative learning method that enhances CL-based paradigm. This paradigm includes: 1) A contrastive view augmentation strategy using a masked autoencoder. 2) Position-aware and semantics-aware positive sample sampling strategy for generating hard negative samples. 3) A hierarchical contrastive learning strategy aimed at capturing local and global information. Furthermore, the hierarchical contrastive learning and sampling strategies aim to constitute an enhanced contrastive discriminator under the generative-contrastive perspective. Finally, we compare our model with seventeen baselines on eight real-world datasets. Our model outperforms the latest baselines on node classification and link prediction tasks.

Abstract: A core data-centric learning challenge is the identification of training samples that are detrimental to model performance. Influence functions serve as a prominent tool for this task and offer a robust framework for assessing training data influence on model predictions. Despite their widespread use, their high computational cost associated with calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix pose constraints, particularly when analyzing large-sized deep models. In this paper, we establish a bridge between identifying detrimental training samples via influence functions and outlier gradient detection. This transformation not only presents a straightforward and Hessian-free formulation but also provides insights into the role of the gradient in sample impact. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we first validate the hypothesis of our proposed outlier gradient analysis approach on synthetic datasets. We then demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting mislabeled samples in vision models and selecting data samples for improving performance of natural language processing transformer models. We also extend its use to influential sample identification for fine-tuning Large Language Models.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a series of techniques that generate high-quality artificial data by manipulating existing data samples. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, AI models can achieve significantly improved applicability in tasks involving scarce or imbalanced datasets, thereby substantially enhancing AI models' generalization capabilities. Existing literature surveys only focus on a certain type of specific modality data, and categorize these methods from modality-specific and operation-centric perspectives, which lacks a consistent summary of data augmentation methods across multiple modalities and limits the comprehension of how existing data samples serve the data augmentation process. To bridge this gap, we propose a more enlightening taxonomy that encompasses data augmentation techniques for different common data modalities. Specifically, from a data-centric perspective, this survey proposes a modality-independent taxonomy by investigating how to take advantage of the intrinsic relationship between data samples, including single-wise, pair-wise, and population-wise sample data augmentation methods. Additionally, we categorize data augmentation methods across five data modalities through a unified inductive approach.

Abstract: In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features, so as to obtain compact dataset for more efficient numerical handling. On the other hand, by isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Tensor factorizations have been widely used for the task of uncovering patterns in various domains. Often, the input is time-evolving, shifting the goal to tracking the evolution of the underlying patterns instead. To adapt to this more complex setting, existing methods incorporate temporal regularization but they either have overly constrained structural requirements or lack uniqueness which is crucial for interpretation. In this paper, in order to capture the underlying evolving patterns, we introduce t(emporal)PARAFAC2, which utilizes temporal smoothness regularization on the evolving factors. Previously, Alternating Optimization (AO) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithmic approach has been introduced to fit the PARAFAC2 model to fully observed data. In this paper, we extend this algorithmic framework to the case of partially observed data and use it to fit the tPARAFAC2 model to complete and incomplete datasets with the goal of revealing evolving patterns. Our numerical experiments on simulated datasets demonstrate that tPARAFAC2 can extract the underlying evolving patterns more accurately compared to the state-of-the-art in the presence of high amounts of noise and missing data. Using two real datasets, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithmic approach in terms of handling missing data and tPARAFAC2 model in terms of revealing evolving patterns. The paper provides an extensive comparison of different approaches for handling missing data within the proposed framework, and discusses both the advantages and limitations of tPARAFAC2 model.

Abstract: We formalise the essential data of objective functions as equality constraints on composites of learners. We call these constraints "tasks", and we investigate the idealised view that such tasks determine model behaviours. We develop a flowchart-like graphical mathematics for tasks that allows us to; (1) offer a unified perspective of approaches in machine learning across domains; (2) design and optimise desired behaviours model-agnostically; and (3) import insights from theoretical computer science into practical machine learning. As a proof-of-concept of the potential practical impact of our theoretical framework, we exhibit and implement a novel "manipulator" task that minimally edits input data to have a desired attribute. Our model-agnostic approach achieves this end-to-end, and without the need for custom architectures, adversarial training, random sampling, or interventions on the data, hence enabling capable, small-scale, and training-stable models.

Abstract: Distributed deep learning in resource-constrained environments faces scalability and generalization challenges due to large effective batch sizes and non-identically distributed client data. We introduce a server-driven sampling strategy that maintains a fixed global batch size by dynamically adjusting client-side batch sizes. This decouples the effective batch size from the number of participating devices and ensures that global batches better reflect the overall data distribution. Using standard concentration bounds, we establish tighter deviation guarantees compared to existing approaches. Empirical results on a benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed method improves model accuracy, training efficiency, and convergence stability, offering a scalable solution for learning at the network edge.

Abstract: This work presents and evaluates the ranking algorithm that has been used by Federation Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) since 2020. The prominent feature of the FIVB ranking is the use of the probabilistic model, which explicitly calculates the probabilities of the future matches results using the estimated teams' strengths. Such explicit modeling is new in the context of official sport rankings, especially for multi-level outcomes, and we study the optimality of its parameters using both analytical and numerical methods. We conclude that from the modeling perspective, the current thresholds fit well the data but adding the home-field advantage (HFA) would be beneficial. Regarding the algorithm itself, we explain the rationale behind the approximations currently used and show a simple method to find new parameters (numerical score) which improve the performance. We also show that the weighting of the match results is counterproductive.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis says that natural high-dimensional data lie on or around a low-dimensional manifold. The recent success of statistical and learning-based methods in very high dimensions empirically supports this hypothesis, suggesting that typical worst-case analysis does not provide practical guarantees. A natural step for analysis is thus to assume the manifold hypothesis and derive bounds that are independent of any ambient dimensions that the data may be embedded in. Theoretical implications in this direction have recently been explored in terms of generalization of ReLU networks and convergence of Langevin methods. In this work, we consider optimal uniform approximations with functions of finite statistical complexity. While upper bounds on uniform approximation exist in the literature using ReLU neural networks, we consider the opposite: lower bounds to quantify the fundamental difficulty of approximation on manifolds. In particular, we demonstrate that the statistical complexity required to approximate a class of bounded Sobolev functions on a compact manifold is bounded from below, and moreover that this bound is dependent only on the intrinsic properties of the manifold, such as curvature, volume, and injectivity radius.

Abstract: Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) have attracted considerable attention for inferring the system states and physical parameters of differential equations according to noisy observations. However, in practice, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) used to estimate the internal parameters of the solver for BPINN often encounters these troubles including poor performance and awful convergence for a given step size used to adjust the momentum of those parameters. To address the convergence of HMC for the BPINN method and extend its application scope to multi-scale partial differential equations (PDE), we develop a robust multi-scale BPINN (dubbed MBPINN) method by integrating multi-scale deep neural networks (MscaleDNN) and the BPINN framework. In this newly proposed MBPINN method, we reframe HMC with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to ensure the most ``likely'' estimation is always provided, and we configure its solver as a Fourier feature mapping-induced MscaleDNN. This novel method offers several key advantages: (1) it is more robust than HMC, (2) it incurs less computational cost than HMC, and (3) it is more flexible for complex problems. We demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed method through some general Poisson and multi-scale elliptic problems in one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Our findings indicate that the proposed method can avoid HMC failures and provide valid results. Additionally, our method is capable of handling complex elliptic PDE and producing comparable results for general elliptic PDE under the case of lower signal-to-noise rate. These findings suggest that our proposed approach has great potential for physics-informed machine learning for parameter estimation and solution recovery in the case of ill-posed problems.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling diverse modalities and tasks, outperforming conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that are highly task-specific and modality-reliant. In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns policies from a fixed dataset, but often requires large amounts of data. The challenge arises when labeled datasets are expensive, especially when rewards have to be provided by human labelers for large datasets. In contrast, unlabelled data tends to be less expensive. This situation highlights the importance of finding effective ways to use unlabelled data in offline RL, especially when labelled data is limited or expensive to obtain. In this paper, we present the algorithm to utilize the unlabeled data in the offline RL method with kernel function approximation and give the theoretical guarantee. We present various eigenvalue decay conditions of $\mathcal{H}_k$ which determine the complexity of the algorithm. In summary, our work provides a promising approach for exploiting the advantages offered by unlabeled data in offline RL, whilst maintaining theoretical assurances.

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables decentralized clients to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping all the training data local. While considerable research has focused on federated image generation, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders have received less attention. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-IID (independently and identically distributed) data environments featuring multiple groups of images of different types. Non-IID data distributions can lead to difficulties in maintaining a consistent latent space and can also result in local generators with disparate texture features being blended during aggregation. We thereby introduce FissionVAE that decouples the latent space and constructs decoder branches tailored to individual client groups. This method allows for customized learning that aligns with the unique data distributions of each group. Additionally, we incorporate hierarchical VAEs and demonstrate the use of heterogeneous decoder architectures within FissionVAE. We also explore strategies for setting the latent prior distributions to enhance the decoupling process. To evaluate our approach, we assemble two composite datasets: the first combines MNIST and FashionMNIST; the second comprises RGB datasets of cartoon and human faces, wild animals, marine vessels, and remote sensing images. Our experiments demonstrate that FissionVAE greatly improves generation quality on these datasets compared to baseline federated VAE models.

Abstract: Current multimodal alignment strategies primarily use single or unified modality encoders, while optimizing the alignment on the original token space. Such a framework is easy to implement and incorporate with the pretrained knowledge, but might result in information bias. To deal with such issues, the joint encoding predictive architecture (JEPA) learns the alignment loss on the latent space, with a predictor to convert the input encoding to the output latent space. However, the application of JEPA in multimodal scenarios is limited so far. In this paper, we introduce M3-Jepa, a scalable multimodal alignment framework, with the predictor implemented by a multi-directional mixture of experts (MoE). We demonstrate the framework can maximize the mutual information with information theory derivations, by alternating the optimization between different uni-directional tasks. By thoroughly designed experiments, we show that M3-Jepa can obtain state-of-the-art performance on different modalities and tasks, generalize to unseen datasets and domains, and is computationally efficient in training and inference. Our study indicates that M3-Jepa might provide a new paradigm to self-supervised learning and open-world modeling.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting is critical for science and society. Yet, existing methods have not managed to simultaneously have the properties of high accuracy, low uncertainty, and high computational efficiency. On one hand, to quantify the uncertainty in weather predictions, the strategy of ensemble forecast (i.e., generating a set of diverse predictions) is often employed. However, traditional ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) is computationally intensive. On the other hand, most existing machine learning-based weather prediction (MLWP) approaches are efficient and accurate. Nevertheless, they are deterministic and cannot capture the uncertainty of weather forecasting. In this work, we propose CoDiCast, a conditional diffusion model to generate accurate global weather prediction, while achieving uncertainty quantification with ensemble forecasts and modest computational cost. The key idea is to simulate a conditional version of the reverse denoising process in diffusion models, which starts from pure Gaussian noise to generate realistic weather scenarios for a future time point. Each denoising step is conditioned on observations from the recent past. Ensemble forecasts are achieved by repeatedly sampling from stochastic Gaussian noise to represent uncertainty quantification. CoDiCast is trained on a decade of ERA5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several existing data-driven methods in accuracy. Our conditional diffusion model, CoDiCast, can generate 6-day global weather forecasts, at 6-hour steps and $5.625^\circ$ latitude-longitude resolution, for over 5 variables, in about 12 minutes on a commodity A100 GPU machine with 80GB memory. The open-souced code is provided at https://github.com/JimengShi/CoDiCast.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learned directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/DeepRUOT.

Abstract: We present Hybrid-Autoregressive INference TrANsducers (HAINAN), a novel architecture for speech recognition that extends the Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) model. Trained with randomly masked predictor network outputs, HAINAN supports both autoregressive inference with all network components and non-autoregressive inference without the predictor. Additionally, we propose a novel semi-autoregressive inference paradigm that first generates an initial hypothesis using non-autoregressive inference, followed by refinement steps where each token prediction is regenerated using parallelized autoregression on the initial hypothesis. Experiments on multiple datasets across different languages demonstrate that HAINAN achieves efficiency parity with CTC in non-autoregressive mode and with TDT in autoregressive mode. In terms of accuracy, autoregressive HAINAN outperforms TDT and RNN-T, while non-autoregressive HAINAN significantly outperforms CTC. Semi-autoregressive inference further enhances the model's accuracy with minimal computational overhead, and even outperforms TDT results in some cases. These results highlight HAINAN's flexibility in balancing accuracy and speed, positioning it as a strong candidate for real-world speech recognition applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into every aspect of our work and daily lives, there are growing concerns about user privacy, which push the trend toward local deployment of these models. There are a number of lightweight LLMs (e.g., Gemini Nano, LLAMA2 7B) that can run locally on smartphones, providing users with greater control over their personal data. As a rapidly emerging application, we are concerned about their performance on commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. To fully understand the current landscape of LLM deployment on mobile platforms, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study on mobile devices. We evaluate both metrics that affect user experience, including token throughput, latency, and battery consumption, as well as factors critical to developers, such as resource utilization, DVFS strategies, and inference engines. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of how these hardware capabilities and system dynamics affect on-device LLM performance, which may help developers identify and address bottlenecks for mobile LLM applications. We also provide comprehensive comparisons across the mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) from major vendors, highlighting their performance differences in handling LLM workloads. We hope that this study can provide insights for both the development of on-device LLMs and the design for future mobile system architecture.

Abstract: In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/

Abstract: Self-supervision is often used for pre-training to foster performance on a downstream task by constructing meaningful representations of samples. Self-supervised learning (SSL) generally involves generating different views of the same sample and thus requires data augmentations that are challenging to construct for tabular data. This constitutes one of the main challenges of self-supervision for structured data. In the present work, we propose a novel augmentation-free SSL method for tabular data. Our approach, T-JEPA, relies on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and is akin to mask reconstruction in the latent space. It involves predicting the latent representation of one subset of features from the latent representation of a different subset within the same sample, thereby learning rich representations without augmentations. We use our method as a pre-training technique and train several deep classifiers on the obtained representation. Our experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement in both classification and regression tasks, outperforming models trained directly on samples in their original data space. Moreover, T-JEPA enables some methods to consistently outperform or match the performance of traditional methods likes Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. To understand why, we extensively characterize the obtained representations and show that T-JEPA effectively identifies relevant features for downstream tasks without access to the labels. Additionally, we introduce regularization tokens, a novel regularization method critical for training of JEPA-based models on structured data.

Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of an AI-based method for particle track identification using scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors. We propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) to efficiently filter and identify frames containing signal from the substantial data generated by SPAD array sensors. Our VAE model, trained on purely background frames, demonstrated a high capability to distinguish frames containing particle tracks from background noise. The performance of the VAE-based anomaly detection was validated with experimental data, demonstrating the method's ability to efficiently identify relevant events with rapid processing time, suggesting a solid prospect for deployment as a fast inference tool on hardware for real-time anomaly detection. This work highlights the potential of combining advanced sensor technology with machine learning techniques to enhance particle detection and tracking.

Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships into machine learning models has gained significant attention, as it enhances generalization from limited data and leads to conforming outputs. However, most existing approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through regularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction--an essential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand, imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a practical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy hard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that modify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with hard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, HardNet is the first method with an efficient forward pass to enforce more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet retains the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of HardNet across various applications: learning with piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers, optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems, and learning safe decision logic for aircraft systems.

<title>MF-LAL: Drug Compound Generation Using Multi-Fidelity Latent Space Active Learning</title>

Abstract: Current generative models for drug discovery primarily use molecular docking as an oracle to guide the generation of active compounds. However, such models are often not useful in practice because even compounds with high docking scores do not consistently show real-world experimental activity. More accurate methods for activity prediction exist, such as molecular dynamics based binding free energy calculations, but they are too computationally expensive to use in a generative model. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Fidelity Latent space Active Learning (MF-LAL), a generative modeling framework that integrates a set of oracles with varying cost-accuracy tradeoffs. We train a surrogate model for each oracle and use these surrogates to guide generation of compounds with high predicted activity. Unlike previous approaches that separately learn the surrogate model and generative model, MF-LAL combines the generative and multi-fidelity surrogate models into a single framework, allowing for more accurate activity prediction and higher quality samples. We train MF-LAL with a novel active learning algorithm to further reduce computational cost. Our experiments on two disease-relevant proteins show that MF-LAL produces compounds with significantly better binding free energy scores than other single and multi-fidelity approaches (~50% improvement in mean binding free energy score).

Abstract: In high-energy physics, particle jet tagging plays a pivotal role in distinguishing quark from gluon jets using data from collider experiments. While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.

Abstract: The NTK is a widely used tool in the theoretical analysis of deep learning, allowing us to look at supervised deep neural networks through the lenses of kernel regression. Recently, several works have investigated kernel models for self-supervised learning, hypothesizing that these also shed light on the behavior of wide neural networks by virtue of the NTK. However, it remains an open question to what extent this connection is mathematically sound -- it is a commonly encountered misbelief that the kernel behavior of wide neural networks emerges irrespective of the loss function it is trained on. In this paper, we bridge the gap between the NTK and self-supervised learning, focusing on two-layer neural networks trained under the Barlow Twins loss. We prove that the NTK of Barlow Twins indeed becomes constant as the width of the network approaches infinity. Our analysis technique is a bit different from previous works on the NTK and may be of independent interest. Overall, our work provides a first justification for the use of classic kernel theory to understand self-supervised learning of wide neural networks. Building on this result, we derive generalization error bounds for kernelized Barlow Twins and connect them to neural networks of finite width.

Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease that impairs mobility and safety by increasing the risk of falls. An effective FOG detection system must be accurate, real-time, and deployable in free-living environments to enable timely interventions. However, existing detection methods face challenges due to (1) intra- and inter-patient variability, (2) subject-specific training, (3) using multiple sensors in FOG dominant locations (e.g., ankles) leading to high failure points, (4) centralized, non-adaptive learning frameworks that sacrifice patient privacy and prevent collaborative model refinement across populations and disease progression, and (5) most systems are tested in controlled settings, limiting their real-world applicability for continuous in-home monitoring. Addressing these gaps, we present FOGSense, a real-world deployable FOG detection system designed for uncontrolled, free-living conditions using only a single sensor. FOGSense uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformations and privacy-preserving federated deep learning to capture temporal and spatial gait patterns missed by traditional methods with a low false positive rate. We evaluated our system using a public Parkinson's dataset collected in a free-living environment. FOGSense improves accuracy by 10.4% over a single-axis accelerometer, reduces failure points compared to multi-sensor systems, and demonstrates robustness to missing values. The federated architecture allows personalized model adaptation and efficient smartphone synchronization during off-peak hours, making it effective for long-term monitoring as symptoms evolve. Overall, FOGSense achieved a 22.2% improvement in F1-score and a 74.53% reduction in false positive rate compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with enhanced sensitivity for FOG episode detection.

Abstract: Multiphysics simulation, which models the interactions between multiple physical processes, and multi-component simulation of complex structures are critical in fields like nuclear and aerospace engineering. Previous studies use numerical solvers or ML-based surrogate models for these simulations. However, multiphysics simulations typically require integrating multiple specialized solvers-each for a specific physical process-into a coupled program, which introduces significant development challenges. Furthermore, existing numerical algorithms struggle with highly complex large-scale structures in multi-component simulations. Here we propose compositional Multiphysics and Multi-component PDE Simulation with Diffusion models (M2PDE) to overcome these challenges. During diffusion-based training, M2PDE learns energy functions modeling the conditional probability of one physical process/component conditioned on other processes/components. In inference, M2PDE generates coupled multiphysics and multi-component solutions by sampling from the joint probability distribution. We evaluate M2PDE on two multiphysics tasks-reaction-diffusion and nuclear thermal coupling-where it achieves more accurate predictions than surrogate models in challenging scenarios. We then apply it to a multi-component prismatic fuel element problem, demonstrating that M2PDE scales from single-component training to a 64-component structure and outperforms existing domain-decomposition and graph-based approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/M2PDE.

Abstract: Predicting Bitcoin price remains a challenging problem due to the high volatility and complex non-linear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. Traditional time-series models, such as ARIMA and GARCH, and recurrent neural networks, like LSTMs, have been widely applied to this task but struggle to capture the regime shifts and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. In this work, we propose CryptoMamba, a novel Mamba-based State Space Model (SSM) architecture designed to effectively capture long-range dependencies in financial time-series data. Our experiments show that CryptoMamba not only provides more accurate predictions but also offers enhanced generalizability across different market conditions, surpassing the limitations of previous models. Coupled with trading algorithms for real-world scenarios, CryptoMamba demonstrates its practical utility by translating accurate forecasts into financial outcomes. Our findings signal a huge advantage for SSMs in stock and cryptocurrency price forecasting tasks.

Abstract: The contextual bandit problem, where agents arrive sequentially with personal contexts and the system adapts its arm allocation decisions accordingly, has recently garnered increasing attention for enabling more personalized outcomes. However, in many healthcare and recommendation applications, agents have private profiles and may misreport their contexts to gain from the system. For example, in adaptive clinical trials, where hospitals sequentially recruit volunteers to test multiple new treatments and adjust plans based on volunteers' reported profiles such as symptoms and interim data, participants may misreport severe side effects like allergy and nausea to avoid perceived suboptimal treatments. We are the first to study this issue of private context misreporting in a stochastic contextual bandit game between the system and non-repeated agents. We show that traditional low-regret algorithms, such as UCB family algorithms and Thompson sampling, fail to ensure truthful reporting and can result in linear regret in the worst case, while traditional truthful algorithms like explore-then-commit (ETC) and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm incur sublinear but high regret. We propose a mechanism that uses a linear program to ensure truthfulness while minimizing deviation from Thompson sampling, yielding an $O(\ln T)$ frequentist regret. Our numerical experiments further demonstrate strong performance in multiple contexts and across other distribution families.

Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical significance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset.

Abstract: The integration of explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into training large language models (LLMs) has advanced their reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanisms by which CoT enhances generalization remain poorly understood. This work investigates (1) \textit{how} CoT training reshapes internal model representations and (2) \textit{why} it improves both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning generalization. Through controlled experiments and theoretical analysis, we derive the following key insights. \textbf{1)} Structural Advantage: CoT training internalizes reasoning into a two-stage generalizing circuit, where the number of stages corresponds to the explicit reasoning steps during training. Notably, CoT-trained models resolve intermediate results at shallower layers compared to non-CoT counterparts, freeing up deeper layers to specialize in subsequent reasoning steps. \textbf{2)} Theoretical Analysis: the information-theoretic generalization bounds via distributional divergence can be decomposed into ID and OOD components. While ID error diminishes with sufficient training regardless of CoT, OOD error critically depends on CoT: Non-CoT training fails to generalize to OOD samples due to unseen reasoning patterns, whereas CoT training achieves near-perfect OOD generalization by mastering subtasks and reasoning compositions during training. The identified mechanisms explain our experimental results: CoT training accelerates convergence and enhances generalization from ID to both ID and OOD scenarios while maintaining robust performance even with tolerable noise. These findings are further validated on complex real-world datasets. This paper offers valuable insights for designing CoT strategies to enhance LLM reasoning robustness.

Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to learn a policy by exploiting a dynamics model derived from an existing dataset. Applying conservative quantification to the dynamics model, most existing works on MORL generate trajectories that approximate the real data distribution to facilitate policy learning by using current information (e.g., the state and action at time step $t$). However, these works neglect the impact of historical information on environmental dynamics, leading to the generation of unreliable trajectories that may not align with the real data distribution. In this paper, we propose a new MORL algorithm \textbf{R}eliability-guaranteed \textbf{T}ransformer (RT), which can eliminate unreliable trajectories by calculating the cumulative reliability of the generated trajectory (i.e., using a weighted variational distance away from the real data). Moreover, by sampling candidate actions with high rewards, RT can efficiently generate high-return trajectories from the existing offline data. We theoretically prove the performance guarantees of RT in policy learning, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness against state-of-the-art model-based methods on several benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization drives the unprecedented performance of modern deep neural network models across diverse applications. Adaptive algorithms have accelerated neural network training due to their rapid convergence rates; however, they struggle to find ``flat minima" reliably, resulting in suboptimal generalization compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD). By revisiting various adaptive algorithms' mechanisms, we propose the Frankenstein optimizer, which combines their advantages. The proposed Frankenstein dynamically adjusts first- and second-momentum coefficients according to the optimizer's current state to directly maintain consistent learning dynamics and immediately reflect sudden gradient changes. Extensive experiments across several research domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, few-shot learning, and scientific simulations show that Frankenstein surpasses existing adaptive algorithms and SGD empirically regarding convergence speed and generalization performance. Furthermore, this research deepens our understanding of adaptive algorithms through centered kernel alignment analysis and loss landscape visualization during the learning process.

Abstract: Reactor physics is the study of neutron properties, focusing on using models to examine the interactions between neutrons and materials in nuclear reactors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant contributions to reactor physics, e.g., in operational simulations, safety design, real-time monitoring, core management and maintenance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of AI approaches in reactor physics, especially considering the category of Machine Learning (ML), with the aim of describing the application scenarios, frontier topics, unsolved challenges and future research directions. From equation solving and state parameter prediction to nuclear industry applications, this paper provides a step-by-step overview of ML methods applied to steady-state, transient and combustion problems. Most literature works achieve industry-demanded models by enhancing the efficiency of deterministic methods or correcting uncertainty methods, which leads to successful applications. However, research on ML methods in reactor physics is somewhat fragmented, and the ability to generalize models needs to be strengthened. Progress is still possible, especially in addressing theoretical challenges and enhancing industrial applications such as building surrogate models and digital twins.

Abstract: Transformers with linear attention offer significant computational advantages over softmax-based transformers but often suffer from degraded performance. The symmetric power (sympow) transformer, a particular type of linear transformer, addresses some of this performance gap by leveraging symmetric tensor embeddings, achieving comparable performance to softmax transformers. However, the finite capacity of the recurrent state in sympow transformers limits their ability to retain information, leading to performance degradation when scaling the training or evaluation context length. To address this issue, we propose the conformal-sympow transformer, which dynamically frees up capacity using data-dependent multiplicative gating and adaptively stores information using data-dependent rotary embeddings. Preliminary experiments on the LongCrawl64 dataset demonstrate that conformal-sympow overcomes the limitations of sympow transformers, achieving robust performance across scaled training and evaluation contexts.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from rewards treated as unnormalized distributions. Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the integration of additional information sources into a Bayesian optimization framework while ensuring that safety constraints are satisfied. The interdependencies between these information sources are modeled using an unknown correlation matrix. We explore how uniform error bounds must be adjusted to maintain constraint satisfaction throughout the optimization process, considering both Bayesian and frequentist statistical perspectives. This is achieved by appropriately scaling the error bounds based on a confidence interval that can be estimated from the data. Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on two benchmark functions and a controller parameter optimization problem. Our results highlight a significant improvement in sample efficiency, demonstrating the methods suitability for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions.

Abstract: The era of foundation models has revolutionized AI research, yet Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale graph corpora. Traditional graph data synthesis techniques primarily focus on simplistic structural operations, lacking the capacity to generate semantically rich nodes with meaningful textual attributes: a critical limitation for real-world applications. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional text generation capabilities, their direct application to graph synthesis is impeded by context window limitations, hallucination phenomena, and structural consistency challenges. To address these issues, we introduce GraphMaster, the first multi-agent framework specifically designed for graph data synthesis in data-limited environments. GraphMaster orchestrates four specialized LLM agents (Manager, Perception, Enhancement, and Evaluation) that collaboratively optimize the synthesis process through iterative refinement, ensuring both semantic coherence and structural integrity. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we create new data-limited "Sub" variants of six standard graph benchmarks, specifically designed to test synthesis capabilities under realistic constraints. Additionally, we develop a novel interpretability assessment framework that combines human evaluation with a principled Grassmannian manifold-based analysis, providing both qualitative and quantitative measures of semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphMaster significantly outperforms traditional synthesis methods across multiple datasets, establishing a strong foundation for advancing GFMs in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Tabular data analysis presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous feature types, missing values, and complex interactions. While traditional machine learning methods, such as gradient boosting, often outperform deep learning approaches, recent advancements in neural architectures offer promising alternatives. This paper introduces TabKAN, a novel framework that advances tabular data modeling using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Unlike conventional deep learning models, KANs leverge learnable activation functions on edges, which improve both interpretability and training efficiency. Our contributions include: (1) the introduction of modular KAN-based architectures for tabular data analysis, (2) the development of a transfer learning framework for KAN models that supports knowledge transfer between domains, (3) the development of model-specific interpretability for tabular data learning, which reduces dependence on post hoc and model-agnostic analysis, and (4) comprehensive evaluation of vanilla supervised learning across binary and multi-class classification tasks. Through extensive benchmarking on diverse public datasets, TabKAN demonstrates superior performance in supervised learning while significantly outperforming classical and Transformer-based models in transfer learning scenarios. Our findings highlight the advantage of KAN-based architectures in transferring knowledge across domains and narrowing the gap between traditional machine learning and deep learning for structured data.

Abstract: Recently, slow-thinking systems like GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated great potential in solving challenging problems through explicit reflection. They significantly outperform the best fast-thinking models, such as GPT-4o, on various math and science benchmarks. However, their multimodal reasoning capabilities remain on par with fast-thinking models. For instance, GPT-o1's performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision is similar to fast-thinking models. In this paper, we aim to enhance the slow-thinking capabilities of vision-language models using reinforcement learning (without relying on distillation) to advance the state of the art. First, we adapt the GRPO algorithm with a novel technique called Selective Sample Replay (SSR) to address the vanishing advantages problem. While this approach yields strong performance, the resulting RL-trained models exhibit limited self-reflection or self-verification. To further encourage slow-thinking, we introduce Forced Rethinking, which appends a rethinking trigger token to the end of rollouts in RL training, explicitly enforcing a self-reflection reasoning step. By combining these two techniques, our model, VL-Rethinker, advances state-of-the-art scores on MathVista, MathVerse to achieve 80.4%, 63.5% respectively. VL-Rethinker also achieves open-source SoTA on multi-disciplinary benchmarks such as MathVision, MMMU-Pro, EMMA, and MEGA-Bench, narrowing the gap with OpenAI-o1. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of our approaches.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.

<title>Entropic Time Schedulers for Generative Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

<title>Observability conditions for neural state-space models with eigenvalues and their roots of unity</title>

Abstract: We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.

Abstract: While non-prehensile manipulation (e.g., controlled pushing/poking) constitutes a foundational robotic skill, its learning remains challenging due to the high sensitivity to complex physical interactions involving friction and restitution. To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to learn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile manipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations. Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins, facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.

<title>Neural operators struggle to learn complex PDEs in pedestrian mobility: Hughes model case study</title>

arXiv:2504.18267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of neural operators in learning solutions for a Hughes model, a first-order hyperbolic conservation law system for crowd dynamics. The model couples a Fokker-Planck equation representing pedestrian density with a Hamilton-Jacobi-type (eikonal) equation. This Hughes model belongs to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems that often exhibit complex solution structures, including shocks and discontinuities. In this study, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators (Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural Operator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1) discontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary conditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes.
  Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios with fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in complex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary conditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The predicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total variation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is similar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce artificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves in hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator architectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their ability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also raise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where shock preservation is essential.

Abstract: Given a cloud of $n$ data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, consider all projections onto $m$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$ and, for each such projection, the empirical distribution of the projected points. What does this collection of probability distributions look like when $n,d$ grow large?
  We consider this question under the null model in which the points are i.i.d. standard Gaussian vectors, focusing on the asymptotic regime in which $n,d\to\infty$, with $n/d\to\alpha\in (0,\infty)$, while $m$ is fixed. Denoting by $\mathscr{F}_{m, \alpha}$ the set of probability distributions in $\mathbb{R}^m$ that arise as low-dimensional projections in this limit, we establish new inner and outer bounds on $\mathscr{F}_{m, \alpha}$. In particular, we characterize the Wasserstein radius of $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ up to constant multiplicative factors, and determine it exactly for $m=1$. We also prove sharp bounds in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence and R\'{e}nyi information dimension.
  The previous question has application to unsupervised learning methods, such as projection pursuit and independent component analysis. We introduce a version of the same problem that is relevant for supervised learning, and prove a sharp Wasserstein radius bound. As an application, we establish an upper bound on the interpolation threshold of two-layers neural networks with $m$ hidden neurons.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has become a powerful framework for estimation under uncertainty, offering strong out-of-sample performance and principled regularization. In this paper, we propose a DRO-based method for linear regression and address a central question: how to optimally choose the robustness radius, which controls the trade-off between robustness and accuracy. Focusing on high-dimensional settings where the dimension and the number of samples are both large and comparable in size, we employ tools from high-dimensional asymptotic statistics to precisely characterize the estimation error of the resulting estimator. Remarkably, this error can be recovered by solving a simple convex-concave optimization problem involving only four scalar variables. This characterization enables efficient selection of the radius that minimizes the estimation error. In doing so, it achieves the same effect as cross-validation, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Numerical experiments confirm that our theoretical predictions closely match empirical performance and that the optimal radius selected through our method aligns with that chosen by cross-validation, highlighting both the accuracy and the practical benefits of our approach.

Abstract: It is imperative to safeguard computer applications and information systems against the growing number of cyber-attacks. Automated software testing tools can be developed to quickly analyze many lines of code and detect vulnerabilities by generating function-specific testing data. This process draws similarities to the constrained adversarial examples generated by adversarial machine learning methods, so there could be significant benefits to the integration of these methods in testing tools to identify possible attack vectors. Therefore, this literature review is focused on the current state-of-the-art of constrained data generation approaches applied for adversarial learning and software testing, aiming to guide researchers and developers to enhance their software testing tools with adversarial testing methods and improve the resilience and robustness of their information systems. The found approaches were systematized, and the advantages and limitations of those specific for white-box, grey-box, and black-box testing were analyzed, identifying research gaps and opportunities to automate the testing tools with data generated by adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The agility of animals, particularly in complex activities such as running, turning, jumping, and backflipping, stands as an exemplar for robotic system design. Transferring this suite of behaviors to legged robotic systems introduces essential inquiries: How can a robot learn multiple locomotion behaviors simultaneously? How can the robot execute these tasks with a smooth transition? How to integrate these skills for wide-range applications? This paper introduces the Versatile Instructable Motion prior (VIM) - a Reinforcement Learning framework designed to incorporate a range of agile locomotion tasks suitable for advanced robotic applications. Our framework enables legged robots to learn diverse agile low-level skills by imitating animal motions and manually designed motions. Our Functionality reward guides the robot's ability to adopt varied skills, and our Stylization reward ensures that robot motions align with reference motions. Our evaluations of the VIM framework span both simulation and the real world. Our framework allows a robot to concurrently learn diverse agile locomotion skills using a single learning-based controller in the real world.

Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of learning quantum processes from quantum statistical queries. We focus on two fundamental learning tasks in this new access model: shadow tomography of quantum processes and process tomography with respect to diamond distance. For the former, we present an efficient average-case algorithm along with a nearly matching lower bound with respect to the number of observables to be predicted. For the latter, we present average-case query complexity lower bounds for learning classes of unitaries. We obtain an exponential lower bound for learning unitary 2-designs and a doubly exponential lower bound for Haar-random unitaries. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our access model by applying our learning algorithm to attack an authentication protocol using Classical-Readout Quantum Physically Unclonable Functions, partially addressing an important open question in quantum hardware security.

Abstract: This paper addresses challenges in robust transfer learning stemming from ambiguity in Bayes classifiers and weak transferable signals between the target and source distribution. We introduce a novel quantity called the ''ambiguity level'' that measures the discrepancy between the target and source regression functions, propose a simple transfer learning procedure, and establish a general theorem that shows how this new quantity is related to the transferability of learning in terms of risk improvements. Our proposed ''Transfer Around Boundary'' (TAB) model, with a threshold balancing the performance of target and source data, is shown to be both efficient and robust, improving classification while avoiding negative transfer. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the TAB model on non-parametric classification and logistic regression tasks, achieving upper bounds which are optimal up to logarithmic factors. Simulation studies lend further support to the effectiveness of TAB. We also provide simple approaches to bound the excess misclassification error without the need for specialized knowledge in transfer learning.

Abstract: Clustering of time series is a well-studied problem, with applications ranging from quantitative, personalized models of metabolism obtained from metabolite concentrations to state discrimination in quantum information theory. We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.

Abstract: Hypergraphs represent complex systems involving interactions among more than two entities and allow the investigation of higher-order structure and dynamics in complex systems. Node attribute data, which often accompanies network data, can enhance the inference of community structure in complex systems. While mixed-membership stochastic block models have been employed to infer community structure in hypergraphs, they complicate the visualization and interpretation of inferred community structure by assuming that nodes may possess soft community memberships. In this study, we propose a framework, HyperNEO, that combines mixed-membership stochastic block models for hypergraphs with dimensionality reduction methods. Our approach generates a node layout that largely preserves the community memberships of nodes. We evaluate our framework on both synthetic and empirical hypergraphs with node attributes. We expect our framework will broaden the investigation and understanding of higher-order community structure in complex systems.

Abstract: Routes represent an integral part of triggering emotions in drivers. Navigation systems allow users to choose a navigation strategy, such as the fastest or shortest route. However, they do not consider the driver's emotional well-being. We present HappyRouting, a novel navigation-based empathic car interface guiding drivers through real-world traffic while evoking positive emotions. We propose design considerations, derive a technical architecture, and implement a routing optimization framework. Our contribution is a machine learning-based generated emotion map layer, predicting emotions along routes based on static and dynamic contextual data. We evaluated HappyRouting in a real-world driving study (N=13), finding that happy routes increase subjectively perceived valence by 11% (p=.007). Although happy routes take 1.25 times longer on average, participants perceived the happy route as shorter, presenting an emotion-enhanced alternative to today's fastest routing mechanisms. We discuss how emotion-based routing can be integrated into navigation apps, promoting emotional well-being for mobility use.

CPP utilizes samples from these random variables along with the quantile lemma - central to conformal prediction - to transform the chance constrained optimization problem into a deterministic problem with a quantile reformulation. CPP inherits a priori guarantees on constraint satisfaction from existing sample average approximation approaches for a class of chance constrained optimization problems, and it provides a posteriori guarantees that are of conditional and marginal nature otherwise. The strength of CPP is that it can easily support different variants of conformal prediction which have been (or will be) proposed within the conformal prediction community. To illustrate this, we present robust CPP to deal with distribution shifts in the random variables and Mondrian CPP to deal with class conditional chance constraints. To enable tractable solutions to the quantile reformulation, we present a mixed integer programming method (CPP-MIP) encoding, a bilevel optimization strategy (CPP-Bilevel), and a sampling-and-discarding optimization strategy (CPP-Discarding). We also extend CPP to deal with joint chance constrained optimization (JCCO). In a series of case studies, we show the validity of the aforementioned approaches, empirically compare CPP-MIP, CPP-Bilevel, as well as CPP-Discarding, and illustrate the advantage of CPP as compared to scenario approach.

Abstract: Average treatment effect estimation is the most central problem in causal inference with application to numerous disciplines. While many estimation strategies have been proposed in the literature, the statistical optimality of these methods has still remained an open area of investigation, especially in regimes where these methods do not achieve parametric rates. In this paper, we adopt the recently introduced structure-agnostic framework of statistical lower bounds, which poses no structural properties on the nuisance functions other than access to black-box estimators that achieve some statistical estimation rate. This framework is particularly appealing when one is only willing to consider estimation strategies that use non-parametric regression and classification oracles as black-box sub-processes. Within this framework, we prove the statistical optimality of the celebrated and widely used doubly robust estimators for both the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), as well as weighted variants of the former, which arise in policy evaluation.

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have demonstrated promising results across various applications within seismology and earthquake engineering. These models rely primarily on utilizing ground motion records for tasks such as earthquake event classification, localization, earthquake early warning systems, and structural health monitoring. However, the extent to which these models truly extract meaningful patterns from these complex time-series signals remains underexplored. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the degree to which auxiliary information, such as seismic phase arrival times or seismic station distribution within a network, dominates the process of deep learning from ground motion records, potentially hindering its effectiveness. Our experimental results reveal a strong dependence on the highly correlated Primary (P) and Secondary (S) phase arrival times. These findings expose a critical gap in the current research landscape, highlighting the lack of robust methodologies for deep learning from single-station ground motion recordings that do not rely on auxiliary inputs.

<title>DSP: Dynamic Sequence Parallelism for Multi-Dimensional Transformers</title>

Abstract: Scaling multi-dimensional transformers to long sequences is indispensable across various domains. However, the challenges of large memory requirements and slow speeds of such sequences necessitate sequence parallelism. All existing approaches fall under the category of embedded sequence parallelism, which are limited to shard along a single sequence dimension, thereby introducing significant communication overhead. However, the nature of multi-dimensional transformers involves independent calculations across multiple sequence dimensions. To this end, we propose Dynamic Sequence Parallelism (DSP) as a novel abstraction of sequence parallelism. DSP dynamically switches the parallel dimension among all sequences according to the computation stage with efficient resharding strategy. DSP offers significant reductions in communication costs, adaptability across modules, and ease of implementation with minimal constraints. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DSP's superiority over state-of-the-art embedded sequence parallelism methods by remarkable throughput improvements ranging from 32.2% to 10x, with less than 25% communication volume.

Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), in finance has garnered increasing academic attention. Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering, and stock movement prediction (binary classification), the application of LLMs to financial risk prediction remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce RiskLabs, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely integrates multimodal financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data to improve financial risk prediction. Empirical results demonstrate RiskLabs' effectiveness in forecasting both market volatility and variance. Through comparative experiments, we examine the contributions of different data sources to financial risk assessment and highlight the crucial role of LLMs in this process. We also discuss the challenges associated with using LLMs for financial risk prediction and explore the potential of combining them with multimodal data for this purpose.

Abstract: Biological nervous systems constitute important sources of inspiration towards computers that are faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient. Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.

Abstract: We consider Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) with One Sided Noncompliance that arise in applications such as digital recommendations and adaptive medical trials. These are settings where decision makers encourage individuals to take treatments over time, but adapt encouragements based on previous encouragements, treatments, states, and outcomes. Importantly, individuals may not comply with encouragements based on unobserved confounders. For settings with binary treatments and encouragements, we provide nonparametric identification, estimation, and inference for Dynamic Local Average Treatment Effects (LATEs), which are expected values of multiple time period treatment effect contrasts for the respective complier subpopulations. Under One Sided Noncompliance and sequential extensions of the assumptions in Imbens and Angrist (1994), we show that one can identify Dynamic LATEs that correspond to treating at single time steps. In Staggered Adoption settings, we show that the assumptions are sufficient to identify Dynamic LATEs for treating in multiple time periods. Moreover, this result extends to any setting where the effect of a treatment in one period is uncorrelated with the compliance event in a subsequent period.

Abstract: Given $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vectors $\boldsymbol{x}_1,\dots, \boldsymbol{x}_n$, we consider the set of all empirical distributions of its $m$-dimensional projections, for $m$ a fixed constant. Diaconis and Freedman (1984) proved that, if $n/d\to \infty$, all such distributions converge to the standard Gaussian distribution. In contrast, we study the proportional asymptotics, whereby $n,d\to \infty$ with $n/d\to \alpha \in (0, \infty)$. In this case, the projection of the data points along a typical random subspace is again Gaussian, but the set $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of all probability distributions that are asymptotically feasible as $m$-dimensional projections contains non-Gaussian distributions corresponding to exceptional subspaces.
  Non-rigorous methods from statistical physics yield an indirect characterization of $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ in terms of a generalized Parisi formula. Motivated by the goal of putting this formula on a rigorous basis, and to understand whether these projections can be found efficiently, we study the subset $\mathscr{F}^{\rm alg}_{m,\alpha}\subseteq \mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of distributions that can be realized by a class of iterative algorithms. We prove that this set is characterized by a certain stochastic optimal control problem, and obtain a dual characterization of this problem in terms of a variational principle that extends Parisi's formula.
  As a byproduct, we obtain computationally achievable values for a class of random optimization problems including `generalized spherical perceptron' models.

Abstract: Deep Learning in Image Registration (DLIR) methods have been tremendously successful in image registration due to their speed and ability to incorporate weak label supervision at training time. However, existing DLIR methods forego many of the benefits and invariances of optimization methods. The lack of a task-specific inductive bias in DLIR methods leads to suboptimal performance, especially in the presence of domain shift. Our method aims to bridge this gap between statistical learning and optimization by explicitly incorporating optimization as a layer in a deep network. A deep network is trained to predict multi-scale dense feature images that are registered using a black box iterative optimization solver. This optimal warp is then used to minimize image and label alignment errors. By implicitly differentiating end-to-end through an iterative optimization solver, we explicitly exploit invariances of the correspondence matching problem induced by the optimization, while learning registration and label-aware features, and guaranteeing the warp functions to be a local minima of the registration objective in the feature space. Our framework shows excellent performance on in-domain datasets, and is agnostic to domain shift such as anisotropy and varying intensity profiles. For the first time, our method allows switching between arbitrary transformation representations (free-form to diffeomorphic) at test time with zero retraining. End-to-end feature learning also facilitates interpretability of features and arbitrary test-time regularization, which is not possible with existing DLIR methods.

arXiv:2406.08918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In differentially private (DP) machine learning, the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms are often reported and compared on the basis of a single $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-pair. This practice overlooks that DP guarantees can vary substantially even between mechanisms sharing a given $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, and potentially introduces privacy vulnerabilities which can remain undetected. This motivates the need for robust, rigorous methods for comparing DP guarantees in such cases. Here, we introduce the $\Delta$-divergence between mechanisms which quantifies the worst-case excess privacy vulnerability of choosing one mechanism over another in terms of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, $f$-DP and in terms of a newly presented Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, as a generalisation of the Blackwell theorem, it is endowed with strong decision-theoretic foundations. Through application examples, we show that our techniques can facilitate informed decision-making and reveal gaps in the current understanding of privacy risks, as current practices in DP-SGD often result in choosing mechanisms with high excess privacy vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The training phase of machine learning models is a delicate step, especially in cybersecurity contexts. Recent research has surfaced a series of insidious training-time attacks that inject backdoors in models designed for security classification tasks without altering the training labels. With this work, we propose new techniques that leverage insights in cybersecurity threat models to effectively mitigate these clean-label poisoning attacks, while preserving the model utility. By performing density-based clustering on a carefully chosen feature subspace, and progressively isolating the suspicious clusters through a novel iterative scoring procedure, our defensive mechanism can mitigate the attacks without requiring many of the common assumptions in the existing backdoor defense literature. To show the generality of our proposed mitigation, we evaluate it on two clean-label model-agnostic attacks on two different classic cybersecurity data modalities: network flows classification and malware classification, using gradient boosting and neural network models.

Abstract: Estimating a distribution given access to its unnormalized density is pivotal in Bayesian inference, where the posterior is generally known only up to an unknown normalizing constant. Variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are the predominant tools for this task; however, both are often challenging to apply reliably, particularly when the posterior has complex geometry. Here, we introduce Soft Contrastive Variational Inference (SoftCVI), which allows a family of variational objectives to be derived through a contrastive estimation framework. The approach parameterizes a classifier in terms of a variational distribution, reframing the inference task as a contrastive estimation problem aiming to identify a single true posterior sample among a set of samples. Despite this framing, we do not require positive or negative samples, but rather learn by sampling the variational distribution and computing ground truth soft classification labels from the unnormalized posterior itself. The objectives have zero variance gradient when the variational approximation is exact, without the need for specialized gradient estimators. We empirically investigate the performance on a variety of Bayesian inference tasks, using both simple (e.g. normal) and expressive (normalizing flow) variational distributions. We find that SoftCVI can be used to form objectives which are stable to train and mass-covering, frequently outperforming inference with other variational approaches.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing tasks, they still struggle with generating logically sound arguments, resulting in potential risks such as spreading misinformation. To address this issue, we introduce FIPO, a fallacy-informed framework that leverages preference optimization methods to steer LLMs toward logically sound arguments. FIPO includes a classification loss, to capture the fine-grained information on fallacy types. Our results on argumentation datasets show that our method reduces the fallacy errors by up to 17.5%. Furthermore, our human evaluation results indicate that the quality of the generated arguments by our method significantly outperforms the fine-tuned baselines, as well as other preference optimization methods, such as DPO. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring models are aware of logical fallacies for effective argument generation. Our code is available at github.com/lucamouchel/Logical-Fallacies.

Abstract: Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in computational chemistry and materials science, complementing computationally intensive ab initio and first-principles methods. Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Moreover, we demonstrate improved robustness during MD simulations of the MLIP models trained with the proposed weakly supervised loss. Finally, our approach improves the fine-tuning of foundation models on sparse, highly accurate ab initio data. An implementation of our method and scripts for executing experiments are available at https://github.com/nec-research/PICPS-ML4Sci.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and finance. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on Tele-Eval and telecommunications-related literature tasks while retaining their previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.

Abstract: Objective: To improve prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models applied to an integrated clinical and claims dataset of varying observation windows, supported by explainable AI (XAI) to enhance interpretability and reduce bias.
  Materials and Methods: We utilized data about 10,326 CKD patients, combining their clinical and claims information from 2009 to 2018. Following data preprocessing, cohort identification, and feature engineering, we evaluated multiple statistical, ML and DL models using data extracted from five distinct observation windows. Feature importance and Shapley value analysis were employed to understand key predictors. Models were tested for robustness, clinical relevance, misclassification errors and bias issues.
  Results: Integrated data models outperformed those using single data sources, with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model achieving the highest AUC (0.93) and F1 score (0.65). A 24-month observation window was identified as optimal for balancing early detection and prediction accuracy. The 2021 eGFR equation improved prediction accuracy and reduced racial bias, notably for African American patients. Discussion: Improved ESRD prediction accuracy, results interpretability and bias mitigation strategies presented in this study have the potential to significantly enhance CKD and ESRD management, support targeted early interventions and reduce healthcare disparities.
  Conclusion: This study presents a robust framework for predicting ESRD outcomes in CKD patients, improving clinical decision-making and patient care through multi-sourced, integrated data and AI/ML methods. Future research will expand data integration and explore the application of this framework to other chronic diseases.

Abstract: Motivated by information geometry, a distance function on the space of stochastic matrices is advocated. Starting with sequences of Markov chains the Bhattacharyya angle is advocated as the natural tool for comparing both short and long term Markov chain runs. Bounds on the convergence of the distance and mixing times are derived. Guided by the desire to compare different Markov chain models, especially in the setting of healthcare processes, a new distance function on the space of stochastic matrices is presented. It is a true distance measure which has a closed form and is efficient to implement for numerical evaluation. In the case of ergodic Markov chains, it is shown that considering either the Bhattacharyya angle on Markov sequences or the new stochastic matrix distance leads to the same distance between models.

<title>From Gradient Clipping to Normalization for Heavy Tailed SGD</title>

Abstract: Recent empirical evidence indicates that many machine learning applications involve heavy-tailed gradient noise, which challenges the standard assumptions of bounded variance in stochastic optimization. Gradient clipping has emerged as a popular tool to handle this heavy-tailed noise, as it achieves good performance in this setting both theoretically and practically. However, our current theoretical understanding of non-convex gradient clipping has three main shortcomings. First, the theory hinges on large, increasing clipping thresholds, which are in stark contrast to the small constant clipping thresholds employed in practice. Second, clipping thresholds require knowledge of problem-dependent parameters to guarantee convergence. Lastly, even with this knowledge, current sampling complexity upper bounds for the method are sub-optimal in nearly all parameters. To address these issues, we study convergence of Normalized SGD (NSGD). First, we establish a parameter-free sample complexity for NSGD of $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-stationary point. Furthermore, we prove tightness of this result, by providing a matching algorithm-specific lower bound. In the setting where all problem parameters are known, we show this complexity is improved to $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\right)$, matching the previously known lower bound for all first-order methods in all problem dependent parameters. Finally, we establish high-probability convergence of NSGD with a mild logarithmic dependence on the failure probability. Our work complements the studies of gradient clipping under heavy tailed noise improving the sample complexities of existing algorithms and offering an alternative mechanism to achieve high probability convergence.

Abstract: This paper studies pricing of weather-derivative (WD) contracts on temperature and precipitation. For temperature-linked strangles in Toronto and Chicago, we benchmark a harmonic-regression/ARMA model against a feed-forward neural network (NN), finding that the NN reduces out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) and materially shifts December fair values relative to both the time-series model and the industry-standard Historic Burn Approach (HBA).
  For precipitation, we employ a compound Poisson--Gamma framework: shape and scale parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and via a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on 30-day rainfall sequences spanning multiple seasons. The CNN adaptively learns season-specific $(\alpha,\beta)$ mappings, thereby capturing heterogeneity across regimes that static i.i.d.\ fits miss. At valuation, we assume days are i.i.d.\ $\Gamma(\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta})$ within each regime and apply a mean-count approximation (replacing the Poisson count by its mean ($n\hat{\lambda}$) to derive closed-form strangle prices.
  Exploratory analysis of 1981--2023 NASA POWER data confirms pronounced seasonal heterogeneity in $(\alpha,\beta)$ between summer and winter, demonstrating that static global fits are inadequate. Back-testing on Toronto and Chicago grids shows that our regime-adaptive CNN yields competitive valuations and underscores how model choice can shift strangle prices. Payoffs are evaluated analytically when possible and by simulation elsewhere, enabling a like-for-like comparison of forecasting and valuation methods.

Abstract: The successive projection algorithm (SPA) is a workhorse algorithm to learn the $r$ vertices of the convex hull of a set of $(r-1)$-dimensional data points, a.k.a. a latent simplex, which has numerous applications in data science. In this paper, we revisit the robustness to noise of SPA and several of its variants. In particular, when $r \geq 3$, we prove the tightness of the existing error bounds for SPA and for two more robust preconditioned variants of SPA. We also provide significantly improved error bounds for SPA, by a factor proportional to the conditioning of the $r$ vertices, in two special cases: for the first extracted vertex, and when $r \leq 2$. We then provide further improvements for the error bounds of a translated version of SPA proposed by Arora et al. (''A practical algorithm for topic modeling with provable guarantees'', ICML, 2013) in two special cases: for the first two extracted vertices, and when $r \leq 3$. Finally, we propose a new more robust variant of SPA that first shifts and lifts the data points in order to minimize the conditioning of the problem. We illustrate our results on synthetic data.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is the de facto standard for compressing large-scale models into smaller ones. Prior works have explored ever more complex KD strategies involving different objective functions, teacher-ensembles, and weight inheritance. In this work we explore an alternative, yet simple approach -- active data curation as effective distillation for contrastive multimodal pretraining. Our simple online batch selection method, ACID, outperforms strong KD baselines across various model-, data- and compute-configurations. Further, we find such an active data curation strategy to in fact be complementary to standard KD, and can be effectively combined to train highly performant inference-efficient models. Our simple and scalable pretraining framework, ACED, achieves state-of-the-art results across 27 zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks with upto 11% less inference FLOPs. We further demonstrate that our ACED models yield strong vision-encoders for training generative multimodal models in the LiT-Decoder setting, outperforming larger vision encoders for image-captioning and visual question-answering tasks.

<title>AMO Sampler: Enhancing Text Rendering with Overshooting</title>

Abstract: Achieving precise alignment between textual instructions and generated images in text-to-image generation is a significant challenge, particularly in rendering written text within images. Sate-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text depiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a training-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly enhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting sampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between over-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and reintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler effectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct the compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the text rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe over-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we propose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively controls the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their attention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9% improvement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising overall image quality or increasing inference cost.

Abstract: We present LiDAR-EDIT, a novel paradigm for generating synthetic LiDAR data for autonomous driving. Our framework edits real-world LiDAR scans by introducing new object layouts while preserving the realism of the background environment. Compared to end-to-end frameworks that generate LiDAR point clouds from scratch, LiDAR-EDIT offers users full control over the object layout, including the number, type, and pose of objects, while keeping most of the original real-world background. Our method also provides object labels for the generated data. Compared to novel view synthesis techniques, our framework allows for the creation of counterfactual scenarios with object layouts significantly different from the original real-world scene. LiDAR-EDIT uses spherical voxelization to enforce correct LiDAR projective geometry in the generated point clouds by construction. During object removal and insertion, generative models are employed to fill the unseen background and object parts that were occluded in the original real LiDAR scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework produces realistic LiDAR scans with practical value for downstream tasks.

Abstract: We consider an inverse problem involving the reconstruction of the solution to a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) with unknown boundary conditions. Instead of direct boundary data, we are provided with a large dataset of boundary observations for typical solutions (collective data) and a bulk measurement of a specific realization. To leverage this collective data, we first compress the boundary data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in a linear expansion. Next, we identify a possible nonlinear low-dimensional structure in the expansion coefficients using an autoencoder, which provides a parametrization of the dataset in a lower-dimensional latent space. We then train an operator network to map the expansion coefficients representing the boundary data to the finite element (FE) solution of the PDE. Finally, we connect the autoencoder's decoder to the operator network which enables us to solve the inverse problem by optimizing a data-fitting term over the latent space. We analyze the underlying stabilized finite element method (FEM) in the linear setting and establish an optimal error estimate in the $H^1$-norm. The nonlinear problem is then studied numerically, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Optimization is crucial for MEC networks to function efficiently and reliably, most of which are NP-hard and lack efficient approximation algorithms. This leads to a paucity of optimal solution, constraining the effectiveness of conventional deep learning approaches. Most existing learning-based methods necessitate extensive optimal data and fail to exploit the potential benefits of suboptimal data that can be obtained with greater efficiency and effectiveness. Taking the multi-server multi-user computation offloading (MSCO) problem, which is widely observed in systems like Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, as a concrete scenario, we present a Graph Diffusion-based Solution Generation (GDSG) method. This approach is designed to work with suboptimal datasets while converging to the optimal solution large probably. We transform the optimization issue into distribution-learning and offer a clear explanation of learning from suboptimal training datasets. We build GDSG as a multi-task diffusion model utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to acquire the distribution of high-quality solutions. We use a simple and efficient heuristic approach to obtain a sufficient amount of training data composed entirely of suboptimal solutions. In our implementation, we enhance the backbone GNN and achieve improved generalization. GDSG also reaches nearly 100\% task orthogonality, ensuring no interference between the discrete and continuous generation tasks. We further reveal that this orthogonality arises from the diffusion-related training loss, rather than the neural network architecture itself. The experiments demonstrate that GDSG surpasses other benchmark methods on both the optimal and suboptimal training datasets. The MSCO datasets has open-sourced at this http URL, as well as the GDSG algorithm codes at https://github.com/qiyu3816/GDSG.

Abstract: Traditional sound design workflows rely on manual alignment of audio events to visual cues, as in Foley sound design, where everyday actions like footsteps or object interactions are recreated to match the on-screen motion. This process is time-consuming, difficult to scale, and lacks automation tools that preserve creative intent. Despite recent advances in vision-to-audio generation, producing temporally coherent and semantically controllable sound effects from video remains a major challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce FolAI, a two-stage generative framework that decouples the when and the what of sound synthesis, i.e., the temporal structure extraction and the semantically guided generation, respectively. In the first stage, we estimate a smooth control signal from the video that captures the motion intensity and rhythmic structure over time, serving as a temporal scaffold for the audio. In the second stage, a diffusion-based generative model produces sound effects conditioned both on this temporal envelope and on high-level semantic embeddings, provided by the user, that define the desired auditory content (e.g., material or action type). This modular design enables precise control over both timing and timbre, streamlining repetitive tasks while preserving creative flexibility in professional Foley workflows. Results on diverse visual contexts, such as footstep generation and action-specific sonorization, demonstrate that our model reliably produces audio that is temporally aligned with visual motion, semantically consistent with user intent, and perceptually realistic. These findings highlight the potential of FolAI as a controllable and modular solution for scalable, high-quality Foley sound synthesis in professional and interactive settings. Supplementary materials are accessible on our dedicated demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/FolAI.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have revolutionized many fields, including healthcare. However, these advances raise significant privacy concerns, especially when pre-trained models fine-tuned and specialized on sensitive data can memorize and then expose and regurgitate personal information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving language modeling approach to address the problem of language models anonymization, and thus promote their sharing. Specifically, we propose both a Masking Language Modeling (MLM) methodology to specialize a BERT-like language model, and a Causal Language Modeling (CLM) methodology to specialize a GPT-like model that avoids the model from memorizing direct and indirect identifying information present in the training data. We have comprehensively evaluated our approaches using a medical dataset and compared them against different baselines. Our results indicate that by avoiding memorizing both direct and indirect identifiers during model specialization, our masking and causal language modeling schemes offer a good tradeoff for maintaining high privacy while retaining high utility.

Abstract: Connectionist approaches to machine learning, \emph{i.e.} neural networks, are enjoying a considerable vogue right now. However, these methods require large volumes of data and produce models that are uninterpretable to humans. An alternative framework that is compatible with neural networks and gradient-based learning, but explicitly models compositionality, is Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). VSAs are a family of algebras on high-dimensional vector representations. They arose in cognitive science from the need to unify neural processing and the kind of symbolic reasoning that humans perform. While machine learning methods have benefited from category-theoretical analyses, VSAs have not yet received similar treatment. In this paper, we present a first attempt at applying category theory to VSAs. Specifically, We generalise from vectors to co-presheaves, and describe VSA operations as the right Kan extensions of the external tensor product. This formalisation involves a proof that the right Kan extension in such cases can be expressed as simple, element-wise operations. We validate our formalisation with worked examples that connect to current VSA implementations, while suggesting new possible designs for VSAs.

Abstract: Anatomical landmark localization in 2D/3D images is a critical task in medical imaging. Although many general-purpose tools exist for landmark localization in classical computer vision tasks, such as pose estimation, they lack the specialized features and modularity necessary for anatomical landmark localization applications in the medical domain. Therefore, we introduce landmarker, a Python package built on PyTorch. The package provides a comprehensive, flexible toolkit for developing and evaluating landmark localization algorithms, supporting a range of methodologies, including static and adaptive heatmap regression. landmarker enhances the accuracy of landmark identification, streamlines research and development processes, and supports various image formats and preprocessing pipelines. Its modular design allows users to customize and extend the toolkit for specific datasets and applications, accelerating innovation in medical imaging. landmarker addresses a critical need for precision and customization in landmark localization tasks not adequately met by existing general-purpose pose estimation tools.

arXiv:2501.10375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, though highly effective for various machine learning tasks, face significant deployment challenges on memory-constrained devices. While GPUs offer fast inference, their limited memory compared to CPUs means not all experts can be stored on the GPU simultaneously, necessitating frequent, costly data transfers from CPU memory, often negating GPU speed advantages. To address this, we present DAOP, an on-device MoE inference engine to optimize parallel GPU-CPU execution. DAOP dynamically allocates experts between CPU and GPU based on per-sequence activation patterns, and selectively pre-calculates predicted experts on CPUs to minimize transfer latency. This approach enables efficient resource utilization across various expert cache ratios while maintaining model accuracy through a novel graceful degradation mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across various datasets show that DAOP outperforms traditional expert caching and prefetching methods by up to 8.20x and offloading techniques by 1.35x while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Images depicting complex, dynamic scenes are challenging to parse automatically, requiring both high-level comprehension of the overall situation and fine-grained identification of participating entities and their interactions. Current approaches use distinct methods tailored to sub-tasks such as Situation Recognition and detection of Human-Human and Human-Object Interactions. However, recent advances in image understanding have often leveraged web-scale vision-language (V&amp;L) representations to obviate task-specific engineering. In this work, we propose a framework for dynamic scene understanding tasks by leveraging knowledge from modern, frozen V&amp;L representations. By framing these tasks in a generic manner - as predicting and parsing structured text, or by directly concatenating representations to the input of existing models - we achieve state-of-the-art results while using a minimal number of trainable parameters relative to existing approaches. Moreover, our analysis of dynamic knowledge of these representations shows that recent, more powerful representations effectively encode dynamic scene semantics, making this approach newly possible.

Abstract: This study introduces a deep learning model based on the U-net architecture to reconstruct missing leads in electrocardiograms (ECGs). The model was trained to reconstruct 12-lead ECG data from reduced lead configurations using publicly available datasets. The results highlight the ability of the model to quantify the information content of each ECG lead and its inter-lead correlations. This has significant implications for optimizing lead selection in diagnostic scenarios, particularly in settings where complete 12-lead ECGs are impractical. In addition, the study provides insights into the physiological underpinnings of ECG signals and their propagation. The findings pave the way for advances in telemedicine, portable ECG devices, and personalized cardiac diagnostics by reducing redundancy and improving signal interpretation.

Abstract: Aligning diffusion models to downstream tasks often requires finetuning new models or gradient-based guidance at inference time to enable sampling from the reward-tilted posterior. In this work, we explore a simple inference-time gradient-free guidance approach, called controlled denoising (CoDe), that circumvents the need for differentiable guidance functions and model finetuning. CoDe is a blockwise sampling method applied during intermediate denoising steps, allowing for alignment with downstream rewards. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, CoDe offers a favorable trade-off between reward alignment, prompt instruction following, and inference cost, achieving a competitive performance against the state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Algorithms are increasingly used to automate or aid human decisions, yet recent research shows that these algorithms may exhibit bias across legally protected demographic groups. However, data on these groups may be unavailable to organizations or external auditors due to privacy legislation. This paper studies bias detection using an unsupervised clustering tool when data on demographic groups are unavailable. We collaborate with the Dutch Executive Agency for Education to audit an algorithm that was used to assign risk scores to college students at the national level in the Netherlands between 2012-2023. Our audit covers more than 250,000 students from the whole country. The unsupervised clustering tool highlights known disparities between students with a non-European migration background and Dutch origin. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we assess bias in a real-world, large-scale and high-stakes decision-making process by a governmental organization; (2) we use simulation studies to highlight potential pitfalls of using the unsupervised clustering tool to detect true bias when demographic group data are unavailable and provide recommendations for valid inferences; (3) we provide the unsupervised clustering tool in an open-source library. Our work serves as a starting point for a deliberative assessment by human experts to evaluate potential discrimination in algorithmic-supported decision-making processes.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown significant promise in various software engineering (SE) tasks, including code generation, debugging, and requirement refinement. Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.

Abstract: The integration of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) into visuo-motor robot learning has emerged as a promising alternative to training visual encoders from scratch. However, PVRs face critical challenges in the context of policy learning, including temporal entanglement and an inability to generalise even in the presence of minor scene perturbations. These limitations hinder performance in tasks requiring temporal awareness and robustness to scene changes. This work identifies these shortcomings and proposes solutions to address them. First, we augment PVR features with temporal perception and a sense of task completion, effectively disentangling them in time. Second, we introduce a module that learns to selectively attend to task-relevant local features, enhancing robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution scenes. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, particularly in PVRs trained with masking objectives, and validate the effectiveness of our enhancements in addressing PVR-specific limitations.

Abstract: As next-generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT) networks continue to grow, the number of connected devices is rapidly increasing, along with their energy demands. This creates challenges for resource management and sustainability. Energy-efficient communication, particularly for power-limited IoT devices, is therefore a key research focus. In this paper, we deployed flying LoRa gateways mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from LoRa end devices and transmit it to a central server. Our primary objective is to maximize the global system energy efficiency of wireless LoRa networks by joint optimization of transmission power, spreading factor, bandwidth, and user association. To solve this challenging problem, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where each flying LoRa GW acts as a learning agent using a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method, based on the multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm, significantly improves the global system energy efficiency and surpasses the popular MARL and other conventional schemes.

Abstract: Inspired by recent findings on the fractal geometry of language, we introduce Recursive INference Scaling (RINS) as a complementary, plug-in recipe for scaling inference time in language and multimodal systems. RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning are essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments. Traditional approaches often treat them separately, limiting the ability for interactive planning. While recent diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in multi-agent trajectory generation, their slow sampling is less suitable for high-frequency planning tasks. In this paper, we leverage the consistency model to build a predictive planner that samples from a joint distribution of ego and surrounding agents, conditioned on the ego vehicle's navigational goal. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates higher-quality trajectories with fewer sampling steps than standard diffusion models, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. To enforce multiple planning constraints simultaneously on the ego trajectory, a novel online guided sampling approach inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is introduced. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our method enables proactive behavior such as nudging and yielding, and also demonstrates smoother, safer, and more efficient trajectories and satisfaction of multiple constraints under a limited computational budget.

Abstract: Code generation, symbolic math reasoning, and other tasks require LLMs to produce outputs that are both syntactically and semantically correct. Constrained LLM generation is a promising direction to enforce adherence to formal grammar, but prior works have empirically observed that strict enforcement of formal constraints often diminishes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical explanation for why constraining LLM outputs to very restrictive grammars that only allow syntactically valid final answers reduces the reasoning capabilities of the model. Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with carefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively balances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of unconstrained generation. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs and benchmarks show that CRANE significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art constrained decoding strategies and standard unconstrained decoding, showing up to 10% points accuracy improvement over baselines on challenging symbolic reasoning benchmarks GSM-symbolic and FOLIO.

Abstract: Due to large intra-subject and inter-subject variabilities of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) usually need subject-specific calibration to tailor the decoding algorithm for each new subject, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly, hindering their real-world applications. Transfer learning (TL) has been extensively used to expedite the calibration, by making use of EEG data from other subjects/sessions. An important consideration in TL for EEG-based BCIs is to reduce the data distribution discrepancies among different subjects/sessions, to avoid negative transfer. Euclidean alignment (EA) was proposed in 2020 to address this challenge. Numerous experiments from 13 different BCI paradigms demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency. This paper revisits EA, explaining its procedure and correct usage, introducing its applications and extensions, and pointing out potential new research directions. It should be very helpful to BCI researchers, especially those who are working on EEG signal decoding.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for text generation has led to widespread concerns about AI-generated content detection. However, an overlooked challenge is AI-polished text, where human-written content undergoes subtle refinements using AI tools. This raises a critical question: should minimally polished text be classified as AI-generated? Such classification can lead to false plagiarism accusations and misleading claims about AI prevalence in online content. In this study, we systematically evaluate twelve state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using our AI-Polished-Text Evaluation (APT-Eval) dataset, which contains 14.7K samples refined at varying AI-involvement levels. Our findings reveal that detectors frequently flag even minimally polished text as AI-generated, struggle to differentiate between degrees of AI involvement, and exhibit biases against older and smaller models. These limitations highlight the urgent need for more nuanced detection methodologies.

<title>Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs</title>

Abstract: We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding. It asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.

arXiv:2502.17579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voice data is increasingly being used in modern digital communications, yet there is still a lack of comprehensive tools for automated voice analysis and characterization. To this end, we developed the VANPY (Voice Analysis in Python) framework for automated pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification of voice data. The VANPY is an open-source end-to-end comprehensive framework that was developed for the purpose of speaker characterization from voice data. The framework is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy integration of new components and adaptation to various voice analysis applications. It currently incorporates over fifteen voice analysis components - including music/speech separation, voice activity detection, speaker embedding, vocal feature extraction, and various classification models.
  Four of the VANPY's components were developed in-house and integrated into the framework to extend its speaker characterization capabilities: gender classification, emotion classification, age regression, and height regression. The models demonstrate robust performance across various datasets, although not surpassing state-of-the-art performance.
  As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the framework's ability to extract speaker characteristics on a use-case challenge of analyzing character voices from the movie "Pulp Fiction." The results illustrate the framework's capability to extract multiple speaker characteristics, including gender, age, height, emotion type, and emotion intensity measured across three dimensions: arousal, dominance, and valence.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion in the scale of large language models (LLMs), enabling efficient distributed inference across multiple computing units has become increasingly critical. However, communication overheads from popular distributed inference techniques such as Tensor Parallelism pose a significant challenge to achieve scalability and low latency. Therefore, we introduce a novel optimization technique, Sync-Point Drop (SPD), to reduce communication overheads in tensor parallelism by selectively dropping synchronization on attention outputs. In detail, we first propose a block design that allows execution to proceed without communication through SPD. Second, we apply different SPD strategies to attention blocks based on their sensitivity to the model accuracy. The proposed methods effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks while minimizing accuracy degradation during LLM inference, offering a scalable solution for diverse distributed environments: SPD offered about 20% overall inference latency reduction with < 1% accuracy regression for LLaMA2-70B inference over 8 GPUs.

<title>A Systematic Literature Review on Safety of the Intended Functionality for Automated Driving Systems</title>

Abstract: In the automobile industry, ensuring the safety of automated vehicles equipped with the Automated Driving System (ADS) is becoming a significant focus due to the increasing development and deployment of automated driving. Automated driving depends on sensing both the external and internal environments of a vehicle, utilizing perception sensors and algorithms, and Electrical/Electronic (E/E) systems for situational awareness and response. ISO 21448 is the standard for Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) that aims to ensure that the ADS operate safely within their intended functionality. SOTIF focuses on preventing or mitigating potential hazards that may arise from the limitations or failures of the ADS, including hazards due to insufficiencies of specification, or performance insufficiencies, as well as foreseeable misuse of the intended functionality. However, the challenge lies in ensuring the safety of vehicles despite the limited availability of extensive and systematic literature on SOTIF. To address this challenge, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on SOTIF for the ADS is performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The objective is to methodically gather and analyze the existing literature on SOTIF. The major contributions of this paper are: (i) presenting a summary of the literature by synthesizing and organizing the collective findings, methodologies, and insights into distinct thematic groups, and (ii) summarizing and categorizing the acknowledged limitations based on data extracted from an SLR of 51 research papers published between 2018 and 2023. Furthermore, research gaps are determined, and future research directions are proposed.

Abstract: Effective trajectory stitching for long-horizon planning is a significant challenge in robotic decision-making. While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source 5K synthetic data trajectories and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

<title>Better Estimation of the KL Divergence Between Language Models</title>

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between language models has many applications, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), interpretability, and knowledge distillation. However, computing the exact KL divergence between two arbitrary language models is intractable. Thus, practitioners often resort to the use of sampling-based estimators. While it is easy to fashion a simple Monte Carlo (MC) estimator that provides an unbiased estimate of the KL divergence between language models, this estimator notoriously suffers from high variance, and can even result in a negative estimate of the KL divergence, a non-negative quantity. In this paper, we introduce a Rao--Blackwellized estimator that is also unbiased and provably has variance less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. In an empirical study on sentiment-controlled fine-tuning, we show that our estimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance substantially in practice. Additionally, we derive an analogous Rao--Blackwellized estimator of the gradient of the KL divergence, which leads to more stable training and produces models that more frequently appear on the Pareto frontier of reward vs. KL compared to the ones trained with the MC estimator of the gradient.

Abstract: We present a geometry-driven method for normalizing dysarthric speech by modeling time, frequency, and amplitude distortions as smooth, local Lie group transformations of spectrograms. Scalar fields generate these deformations via exponential maps, and a neural network is trained - using only synthetically warped healthy speech - to infer the fields and apply an approximate inverse at test time. We introduce a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SSB) potential that encourages the model to discover non-trivial field configurations. On real pathological speech, the system delivers consistent gains: up to 17 percentage-point WER reduction on challenging TORGO utterances and a 16 percent drop in WER variance, with no degradation on clean CommonVoice data. Character and phoneme error rates improve in parallel, confirming linguistic relevance. Our results demonstrate that geometrically structured warping provides consistent, zero-shot robustness gains for dysarthric ASR.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning aims to quickly identify solutions for new tasks with minimal or no additional interaction with the environment. Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) addresses this by combining a set of base policies to produce a new one that is at least as good -- though not necessarily optimal -- as any individual base policy. Optimality can be ensured, particularly in the linear-reward case, via techniques that compute a Convex Coverage Set (CCS). However, these are computationally expensive and do not scale to complex domains. The Option Keyboard (OK) improves upon GPI by producing policies that are at least as good -- and often better. It achieves this through a learned meta-policy that dynamically combines base policies. However, its performance critically depends on the choice of base policies. This raises a key question: is there an optimal set of base policies -- an optimal behavior basis -- that enables zero-shot identification of optimal solutions for any linear tasks? We solve this open problem by introducing a novel method that efficiently constructs such an optimal behavior basis. We show that it significantly reduces the number of base policies needed to ensure optimality in new tasks. We also prove that it is strictly more expressive than a CCS, enabling particular classes of non-linear tasks to be solved optimally. We empirically evaluate our technique in challenging domains and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, increasingly so as task complexity increases.

Summary:
In this study, the authors explore the limitations of Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) in deep learning models. They introduce the concept of probabilistic graphical models (PGM) to analyze the issue of routing fluctuations and non-robustness in SMoE. By addressing the independence in expert selection of tokens, the authors propose a new model called Similarity-Aware (S)MoE. This model considers token interactions during expert selection, leading to the development of the Attention-Aware (S)MoE which utilizes the attention matrix for guiding token routing. Theoretical analysis shows that similarity/attention-aware routing reduces entropy in expert selection, resulting in more stable token routing mechanisms. Empirical validation on various tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of these models, showing improvements in reducing routing fluctuations, enhancing accuracy, and increasing model robustness compared to baseline models. <div>
arXiv:2505.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has emerged as a key to achieving unprecedented scalability in deep learning. By activating only a small subset of parameters per sample, SMoE achieves an exponential increase in parameter counts while maintaining a constant computational overhead. However, SMoE models are susceptible to routing fluctuations--changes in the routing of a given input to its target expert--at the late stage of model training, leading to model non-robustness. In this work, we unveil the limitation of SMoE through the perspective of the probabilistic graphical model (PGM). Through this PGM framework, we highlight the independence in the expert-selection of tokens, which exposes the model to routing fluctuation and non-robustness. Alleviating this independence, we propose the novel Similarity-Aware (S)MoE, which considers interactions between tokens during expert selection. We then derive a new PGM underlying an (S)MoE-Attention block, going beyond just a single (S)MoE layer. Leveraging the token similarities captured by the attention matrix, we propose the innovative Attention-Aware (S)MoE, which employs the attention matrix to guide the routing of tokens to appropriate experts in (S)MoE. We theoretically prove that Similarity/Attention-Aware routing help reduce the entropy of expert selection, resulting in more stable token routing mechanisms. We empirically validate our models on various tasks and domains, showing significant improvements in reducing routing fluctuations, enhancing accuracy, and increasing model robustness over the baseline MoE-Transformer with token routing via softmax gating.

The paper discusses the challenges faced in gradient-based bilevel optimization due to the computational expense of calculating second-order and mixed derivatives. It introduces a novel algorithm called MixFlow-MG that utilizes mixed-mode differentiation to improve the efficiency and scalability of computational graphs in meta-learning setups. By exploiting the specific structure of these problems, MixFlow-MG achieves over 10x memory and up to 25% wall-clock time improvements compared to standard implementations. The algorithm addresses the limitations of modern automatic differentiation libraries by enhancing the performance of gradient-of-a-gradient calculations, making it a valuable tool for various applications such as hyperparameter optimization, task adaptation, and algorithm discovery. <div>

Abstract: Gradient-based bilevel optimisation is a powerful technique with applications in hyperparameter optimisation, task adaptation, algorithm discovery, meta-learning more broadly, and beyond. It often requires differentiating through the gradient-based optimisation process itself, leading to "gradient-of-a-gradient" calculations with computationally expensive second-order and mixed derivatives. While modern automatic differentiation libraries provide a convenient way to write programs for calculating these derivatives, they oftentimes cannot fully exploit the specific structure of these problems out-of-the-box, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we analyse such cases and propose Mixed-Flow Meta-Gradients, or MixFlow-MG -- a practical algorithm that uses mixed-mode differentiation to construct more efficient and scalable computational graphs yielding over 10x memory and up to 25% wall-clock time improvements over standard implementations in modern meta-learning setups.

Summary: 
The article discusses the Explanatory View Hypothesis, which posits that neural networks inherently contain implicit explanations that can be extracted and understood. It introduces the concept of Explanatory Faithfulness, which assesses how well an explanation aligns with a model. The authors define Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) as the practice of producing detailed, model-level, ontic, causal-mechanistic, and falsifiable explanations of neural networks. This definition allows for a clear distinction between MI and other interpretability paradigms while outlining the inherent limitations of MI. The article also introduces the Principle of Explanatory Optimism, suggesting that a positive outlook on the explanatory capabilities of neural networks is crucial for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability. <div>

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability aims to understand neural networks through causal explanations. We argue for the Explanatory View Hypothesis: that Mechanistic Interpretability research is a principled approach to understanding models because neural networks contain implicit explanations which can be extracted and understood. We hence show that Explanatory Faithfulness, an assessment of how well an explanation fits a model, is well-defined. We propose a definition of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) as the practice of producing Model-level, Ontic, Causal-Mechanistic, and Falsifiable explanations of neural networks, allowing us to distinguish MI from other interpretability paradigms and detail MI's inherent limits. We formulate the Principle of Explanatory Optimism, a conjecture which we argue is a necessary precondition for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability.

arXiv:2505.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate a scalable methodology for harmonizing inconsistent units in large-scale clinical datasets, addressing a key barrier to data interoperability.
  Materials and Methods: We designed a novel unit harmonization system combining BM25, sentence embeddings, Bayesian optimization, and a bidirectional transformer based binary classifier for retrieving and matching laboratory test entries. The system was evaluated using the Optum Clinformatics Datamart dataset (7.5 billion entries). We implemented a multi-stage pipeline: filtering, identification, harmonization proposal generation, automated re-ranking, and manual validation. Performance was assessed using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and other standard information retrieval metrics.
  Results: Our hybrid retrieval approach combining BM25 and sentence embeddings (MRR: 0.8833) significantly outperformed both lexical-only (MRR: 0.7985) and embedding-only (MRR: 0.5277) approaches. The transformer-based reranker further improved performance (absolute MRR improvement: 0.10), bringing the final system MRR to 0.9833. The system achieved 83.39\% precision at rank 1 and 94.66\% recall at rank 5.
  Discussion: The hybrid architecture effectively leverages the complementary strengths of lexical and semantic approaches. The reranker addresses cases where initial retrieval components make errors due to complex semantic relationships in medical terminology.
  Conclusion: Our framework provides an efficient, scalable solution for unit harmonization in clinical datasets, reducing manual effort while improving accuracy. Once harmonized, data can be reused seamlessly in different analyses, ensuring consistency across healthcare systems and enabling more reliable multi-institutional studies and meta-analyses.

Summary:<br />
Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks can suffer from degraded generalization performance when trained with noisy supervision. Existing methods to address this issue often come with drawbacks such as high computational costs and the need for heavy hyperparameter tuning. In this study, a novel two-stage noisy learning framework is proposed to optimize at the instance level using a dynamically weighted loss function, eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning. A metric called wrong event is introduced to capture the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples for noise modeling without adding significant computational costs. The framework first builds a strong base model using wrong event information and then conducts noise-robust training on this model using a probabilistic approach. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming existing methods in performance while also significantly reducing computational time and improving model scalability.<br />

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that deep neural networks degrade in generalization performance under noisy supervision. Existing methods focus on isolating clean subsets or correcting noisy labels, facing limitations such as high computational costs, heavy hyperparameter tuning process, and coarse-grained optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage noisy learning framework that enables instance-level optimization through a dynamically weighted loss function, avoiding hyperparameter tuning. To obtain stable and accurate information about noise modeling, we introduce a simple yet effective metric, termed wrong event, which dynamically models the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples while maintaining computational costs. Our framework first collects wrong event information and builds a strong base model. Then we perform noise-robust training on the base model, using a probabilistic model to handle the wrong event information of samples. Experiments on five synthetic and real-world LNL benchmarks demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance, achieves a nearly 75% reduction in computational time and improves model scalability.

<div> Hidden Markov Model, Transformer architecture, optimal control, decoder-only transformers, numerical experiments

Summary:
This paper presents a mathematical framework for causal nonlinear prediction in settings where observations are generated from a hidden Markov model (HMM). The framework is motivated by the decoder-only transformer architecture used for sequence prediction tasks. The proposed solution is based on an optimal control approach, redefining the prediction objective as an optimal control problem and deriving a fixed-point equation on the space of probability measures. The dual filter algorithm is introduced to solve the fixed-point equation, resembling the architecture of decoder-only transformers. The parallels between the algorithm and transformer models are discussed, highlighting prior work on mathematical modeling of transformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the algorithm, using parameters commonly found in large-scale transformer models. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for causal nonlinear prediction in settings where observations are generated from an underlying hidden Markov model (HMM). Both the problem formulation and the proposed solution are motivated by the decoder-only transformer architecture, in which a finite sequence of observations (tokens) is mapped to the conditional probability of the next token. Our objective is not to construct a mathematical model of a transformer. Rather, our interest lies in deriving, from first principles, transformer-like architectures that solve the prediction problem for which the transformer is designed. The proposed framework is based on an original optimal control approach, where the prediction objective (MMSE) is reformulated as an optimal control problem. An analysis of the optimal control problem is presented leading to a fixed-point equation on the space of probability measures. To solve the fixed-point equation, we introduce the dual filter, an iterative algorithm that closely parallels the architecture of decoder-only transformers. These parallels are discussed in detail along with the relationship to prior work on mathematical modeling of transformers as transport on the space of probability measures. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the performance of the algorithm using parameter values used in researchscale transformer models.

<br />
Summary: 
Phase change is crucial in thermal management, but measuring temperature in complex flow regimes is challenging. This study introduces a data-driven approach using a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to infer temperature fields from phase contours in a pool boiling setup. By training the model with high-speed imaging data and simulations, temperature fields can be reconstructed with less than 6% error. Standard data augmentation techniques improve accuracy and physical realism of the predicted maps for both simulated and experimental data. The results demonstrate the potential of deep generative models to enhance understanding of multiphase heat transfer processes and interpret experimental measurements in complex two-phase systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change plays a critical role in thermal management systems, yet quantitative characterization of multiphase heat transfer remains limited by the challenges of measuring temperature fields in chaotic, rapidly evolving flow regimes. While computational methods offer spatiotemporal resolution in idealized cases, replicating complex experimental conditions remains prohibitively difficult. Here, we present a data-driven framework that leverages a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to infer temperature fields from geometric phase contours in a canonical pool boiling configuration where advanced data collection techniques are restricted. Using high-speed imaging data and simulation-informed training, our model demonstrates the ability to reconstruct temperature fields with errors below 6%. We further show that standard data augmentation strategies are effective in enhancing both accuracy and physical plausibility of the predicted maps across both simulation and experimental datasets when precise physical constraints are not applicable. Our results highlight the potential of deep generative models to bridge the gap between observable multiphase phenomena and underlying thermal transport, offering a powerful approach to augment and interpret experimental measurements in complex two-phase systems.

<div> intersectional fairness, regression tasks, protected attributes, fairness measure, ID

Summary:
In a new research paper, the focus is on addressing the gaps in measuring fairness in regression tasks, unlike existing work that mainly concentrates on classification tasks. The proposal introduces the concept of intersectional fairness in regression, considering combinations of all protected attributes, rather than just individual ones. Additionally, the paper argues that evaluating group errors without considering imbalanced domain preferences is inadequate. The concept of Intersectional Divergence (ID) is introduced as a fairness measure for regression tasks that describes fair model behavior across multiple protected attributes and takes into account the impact of predictions in relevant target ranges. The paper demonstrates how ID can be used as a loss function, called IDLoss, in optimization problems. Experimental results show that incorporating IDLoss into optimization can significantly enhance single-attribute and intersectional fairness of models while maintaining competitive predictive performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Research on fairness in machine learning has been mainly framed in the context of classification tasks, leaving critical gaps in regression. In this paper, we propose a seminal approach to measure intersectional fairness in regression tasks, going beyond the focus on single protected attributes from existing work to consider combinations of all protected attributes. Furthermore, we contend that it is insufficient to measure the average error of groups without regard for imbalanced domain preferences. To this end, we propose Intersectional Divergence (ID) as the first fairness measure for regression tasks that 1) describes fair model behavior across multiple protected attributes and 2) differentiates the impact of predictions in target ranges most relevant to users. We extend our proposal demonstrating how ID can be adapted into a loss function, IDLoss, and used in optimization problems. Through an extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate how ID allows unique insights into model behavior and fairness, and how incorporating IDLoss into optimization can considerably improve single-attribute and intersectional model fairness while maintaining a competitive balance in predictive performance.

Abstract: Wildfires pose a critical environmental issue to ecosystems, economies, and public safety, particularly in Mediterranean regions such as Spain. Accurate predictive models rely on high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture the complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. To address the lack of localised and fine-grained datasets in Spain, this work introduces IberFire, a spatio-temporal datacube at 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 260 features across eight main categories: auxiliary features, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity, and land cover. All features are derived from open-access sources, ensuring transparency and real-time applicability. The data processing pipeline was implemented entirely using open-source tools, and the codebase has been made publicly available. This work not only enhances spatio-temporal granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datacubes but also provides a reproducible methodology for constructing similar datasets. IberFire supports advanced wildfire risk modelling through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, enables climate pattern analysis and informs strategic planning in fire prevention and land management. The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.

<div> quantization, outlier suppression, index coding, Large Language Models, ICQuant

Summary:
ICQuant is a new framework designed to address the challenge of outlier suppression in weight quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging outlier statistics, ICQuant utilizes an efficient index coding scheme to improve quantization quality while minimizing bit overhead. Unlike existing techniques, ICQuant requires only a fraction of a bit to adjust quantization ranges, resulting in significant memory savings, especially in extreme compression scenarios. When applied to a 2-bit Llama3-70B model, ICQuant enhances zero-shot accuracy by up to 130% - 150% compared to other methods like QTIP and QuIP#. Furthermore, ICQuant achieves comparable performance to the top fine-tuned quantizer without the need for additional fine-tuning. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ICQuant in outlier-aware weight-only quantization for LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the need for efficient low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ), due to their high memory costs. A key challenge in weight quantization is the presence of outliers, which inflate quantization ranges and lead to large errors. While a number of outlier suppression techniques have been proposed, they either: fail to effectively shrink the quantization range, or incur (relatively) high bit overhead. In this paper, we present ICQuant, a novel framework that leverages outlier statistics to design an efficient index coding scheme for outlier-aware weight-only quantization. Compared to existing outlier suppression techniques requiring $\approx 1$ bit overhead to halve the quantization range, ICQuant requires only $\approx 0.3$ bits; a significant saving in extreme compression regimes (e.g., 2-3 bits per weight). ICQuant can be used on top of any existing quantizers to eliminate outliers, improving the quantization quality. Using just 2.3 bits per weight and simple scalar quantizers, ICQuant improves the zero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150% relative to QTIP and QuIP#; and it achieves comparable performance to the best-known fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Effectively modeling time information and incorporating it into applications or models involving chronologically occurring events is crucial. Real-world scenarios often involve diverse and complex time patterns, which pose significant challenges for time encoding methods. While previous methods focus on capturing time patterns, many rely on specific inductive biases, such as using trigonometric functions to model periodicity. This narrow focus on single-pattern modeling makes them less effective in handling the diversity and complexities of real-world time patterns. In this paper, we investigate to improve the existing commonly used time encoding methods and introduce Learnable Transformation-based Generalized Time Encoding (LeTE). We propose using deep function learning techniques to parameterize non-linear transformations in time encoding, making them learnable and capable of modeling generalized time patterns, including diverse and complex temporal dynamics. By enabling learnable transformations, LeTE encompasses previous methods as specific cases and allows seamless integration into a wide range of tasks. Through extensive experiments across diverse domains, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of LeTE.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to novel tasks and enhancing their overall capabilities often requires large, high-quality training datasets. Synthetic data, generated at scale, serves a valuable alternative when real-world data is scarce or difficult to obtain. However, ensuring the quality of synthetic datasets is challenging, as developers must manually inspect and refine numerous samples to identify errors and areas for improvement. This process is time-consuming and requires specialized tools. We introduce NeMo-Inspector, an open-source tool designed to simplify the analysis of synthetic datasets with integrated inference capabilities. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two real-world cases. Analysis and cleaning of the synthetically generated GSM-Plus dataset with NeMo-Inspector led to a significant decrease in low-quality samples from 46.99% to 19.51%. The tool also helped identify and correct generation errors in OpenMath models, improving accuracy by 1.92% on the MATH dataset and by 4.17% on the GSM8K dataset for a Meta-Llama-3-8B model fine-tuned on synthetic data generated from Nemotron-4-340B.

Summary:  
Control barrier functions are essential for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing synthesis algorithms face issues with dimensionality, prompting the use of deep learning. This paper introduces an algorithm for training control barrier functions from offline datasets, focusing on preventing the system from entering unsafe or unreliable states. The Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs) generated by the algorithm demonstrate improved safety and out-of-distribution avoidance without significant task performance degradation. <div>
arXiv:2505.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety filters, particularly those based on control barrier functions, have gained increased interest as effective tools for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms, however, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by proposing an algorithm for training control barrier functions from offline datasets. Our algorithm trains the filter to not only prevent the system from reaching unsafe states but also out-of-distribution ones, at which the filter would be unreliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety and out-of-distribution avoidance while minimally affecting task performance.

Policy iteration involves solving the value function under a fixed control policy and updating the policy based on the resulting value function. By leveraging the linear structure of GPs, each policy evaluation step has an explicit closed-form solution, eliminating the need for numerical optimization.

Abstract: We propose a Gaussian Process (GP)-based policy iteration framework for addressing both forward and inverse problems in Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations and mean field games (MFGs). Policy iteration is formulated as an alternating procedure between solving the value function under a fixed control policy and updating the policy based on the resulting value function. By exploiting the linear structure of GPs for function approximation, each policy evaluation step admits an explicit closed-form solution, eliminating the need for numerical optimization. To improve convergence, we incorporate the additive Schwarz acceleration as a preconditioning step following each policy update. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Schwarz acceleration in improving computational efficiency.

Summary:
Many offline-to-online algorithms struggle with fine-tuning learned policies, often experiencing performance degradation or slow learning. Traditional approaches focus on improving learning efficiency but result in initially decreased agent performance during fine-tuning. A new fine-tuning algorithm, based on the Jump Start algorithm, gradually increases exploration based on online performance estimates. This approach leads to faster fine-tuning and reduces performance degradation compared to existing algorithms. By incorporating online estimates of performance, the algorithm manages exploration more effectively, resulting in improved policy adaptation during the fine-tuning stage. This advancement addresses the challenges of fine-tuning learned networks online, offering a solution to the common problem of performance degradation during the initial fine-tuning phase. <div>
arXiv:2505.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning policies learned offline remains a major challenge in application domains. Monotonic performance improvement during \emph{fine-tuning} is often challenging, as agents typically experience performance degradation at the early fine-tuning stage. The community has identified multiple difficulties in fine-tuning a learned network online, however, the majority of progress has focused on improving learning efficiency during fine-tuning. In practice, this comes at a serious cost during fine-tuning: initially, agent performance degrades as the agent explores and effectively overrides the policy learned offline. We show across a range of settings, many offline-to-online algorithms exhibit either (1) performance degradation or (2) slow learning (sometimes effectively no improvement) during fine-tuning. We introduce a new fine-tuning algorithm, based on an algorithm called Jump Start, that gradually allows more exploration based on online estimates of performance. Empirically, this approach achieves fast fine-tuning and significantly reduces performance degradations compared with existing algorithms designed to do the same.

Summary:
The study examines how a one-layer transformer learns to solve regular language recognition tasks like even pairs and parity check. It analyzes the training dynamics under gradient descent. Even pairs can be solved directly by the transformer, but parity check requires the integration of Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer rapidly maps data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer stabilizes, while the linear layer grows logarithmically towards a max-margin hyperplane. The loss decreases at a rate of O(1/t) as the linear layer approaches correct separation of outputs. Experimental results confirm the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Language recognition tasks are fundamental in natural language processing (NLP) and have been widely used to benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs). These tasks also play a crucial role in explaining the working mechanisms of transformers. In this work, we focus on two representative tasks in the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and `parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of certain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a one-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin hyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive and negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$. Our experiments validate those theoretical results.

<div> Transformer architecture, long sequences, self-attention computation, scalable models, memory mechanism 

Summary:
The Transformer architecture has been successful in various language processing and visual tasks but struggles with scaling to long sequences due to quadratic self-attention computation. To address this challenge, several methods break sequences into segments, limiting self-attention to local dependencies within each segment. However, these approaches introduce additional compute overhead. The Compact Recurrent Transformer (CRT) proposed in this study combines shallow Transformer models with recurrent neural networks to efficiently compress and manage long-range global information using a single memory vector. CRT achieves competitive results on language datasets like WordPTB and WikiText-103, using shorter segments and reduced computational complexity compared to full-length Transformers. It also demonstrates top performance on the Toyota Smarthome video dataset. This approach offers a promising solution for applications with limited compute resources like edge computing.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has shown significant success in many language processing and visual tasks. However, the method faces challenges in efficiently scaling to long sequences because the self-attention computation is quadratic with respect to the input length. To overcome this limitation, several approaches scale to longer sequences by breaking long sequences into a series of segments, restricting self-attention to local dependencies between tokens within each segment and using a memory mechanism to manage information flow between segments. However, these approached generally introduce additional compute overhead that restricts them from being used for applications where limited compute memory and power are of great concern (such as edge computing). We propose a novel and efficient Compact Recurrent Transformer (CRT), which combines shallow Transformer models that process short local segments with recurrent neural networks to compress and manage a single persistent memory vector that summarizes long-range global information between segments. We evaluate CRT on WordPTB and WikiText-103 for next-token-prediction tasks, as well as on the Toyota Smarthome video dataset for classification. CRT achieves comparable or superior prediction results to full-length Transformers in the language datasets while using significantly shorter segments (half or quarter size) and substantially reduced FLOPs. Our approach also demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Toyota Smarthome video dataset.

<div> Algorithm, Anomaly, Root cause, Fix, Interventional estimates

Summary:<br />
The article presents a novel algorithm called In-Distribution Interventions (IDI) aimed at diagnosing the root cause of anomalies in complex interconnected systems. IDI predicts root cause nodes by considering nodes with anomalous values that, if restored to usual values, would prevent the anomaly. Unlike previous methods that rely on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual estimates, IDI uses interventional estimates obtained from the SCM at in-distribution inputs to overcome the unreliability of counterfactual estimates for rare anomalies. Theoretical analysis is provided to compare and bound the errors in assessing the fix condition using interventional and counterfactual estimates. Experimental results on synthetic and PetShop RCD benchmark datasets demonstrate that IDI outperforms nine existing state-of-the-art Root Cause Diagnosis (RCD) baselines by accurately and robustly identifying true root causes. The code for IDI is available on GitHub for further exploration and use.

Abstract: Diagnosing the root cause of an anomaly in a complex interconnected system is a pressing problem in today's cloud services and industrial operations. We propose In-Distribution Interventions (IDI), a novel algorithm that predicts root cause as nodes that meet two criteria: 1) **Anomaly:** root cause nodes should take on anomalous values; 2) **Fix:** had the root cause nodes assumed usual values, the target node would not have been anomalous. Prior methods of assessing the fix condition rely on counterfactuals inferred from a Structural Causal Model (SCM) trained on historical data. But since anomalies are rare and fall outside the training distribution, the fitted SCMs yield unreliable counterfactual estimates. IDI overcomes this by relying on interventional estimates obtained by solely probing the fitted SCM at in-distribution inputs. We present a theoretical analysis comparing and bounding the errors in assessing the fix condition using interventional and counterfactual estimates. We then conduct experiments by systematically varying the SCM's complexity to demonstrate the cases where IDI's interventional approach outperforms the counterfactual approach and vice versa. Experiments on both synthetic and PetShop RCD benchmark datasets demonstrate that \our\ consistently identifies true root causes more accurately and robustly than nine existing state-of-the-art RCD baselines. Code is released at https://github.com/nlokeshiisc/IDI_release.

Summary:
The paper introduces a Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for detecting faulty bikes in bike-sharing systems. The model utilizes spatiotemporal features extracted from GPS data and trip records. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations through a self-supervised objective, and in the fine-tuning phase, it is adapted for binary classification. Experiments on a real-world dataset from Chengdu show that SSTransformer outperforms traditional methods, achieving high accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358).

Abstract: The rapid expansion of bike-sharing systems (BSS) has greatly improved urban "last-mile" connectivity, yet large-scale deployments face escalating operational challenges, particularly in detecting faulty bikes. Existing detection approaches either rely on static model-based thresholds that overlook dynamic spatiotemporal (ST) usage patterns or employ supervised learning methods that struggle with label scarcity and class imbalance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for automatically detecting unusable shared bikes, leveraging ST features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records. The model incorporates a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance its feature extraction capabilities, followed by fine-tuning for efficient status recognition. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations of bike movement via a self-supervised objective; in the fine-tuning phase, the encoder is adapted to a downstream binary classification task. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of 10,730 bikes (1,870 unusable, 8,860 normal) from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SSTransformer significantly outperforms traditional machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving the best accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358). This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised Transformer on ST data for capturing complex anomalies in BSS, paving the way toward more reliable and scalable maintenance solutions for shared mobility.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) represent a promising frontier in machine learning, leveraging the complementary strengths of both models. In this work, we propose the development of TunnElQNN, a non-sequential architecture composed of alternating classical and quantum layers. Within the classical component, we employ the Tunnelling Diode Activation Function (TDAF), inspired by the I-V characteristics of quantum tunnelling. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid model on a synthetic dataset of interleaving half-circle for multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of class overlap. The model is compared against a baseline hybrid architecture that uses the conventional ReLU activation function (ReLUQNN). Our results show that the TunnElQNN model consistently outperforms the ReLUQNN counterpart. Furthermore, we analyse the decision boundaries generated by TunnElQNN under different levels of class overlap and compare them to those produced by a neural network implementing TDAF within a fully classical architecture. These findings highlight the potential of integrating physics-inspired activation functions with quantum components to enhance the expressiveness and robustness of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning architectures.

<div> Algorithm, Multisource data, StablePCA, Latent representations, Convex optimization 

Summary: 
StablePCA is introduced as a method for robust learning of latent representations in multi-source high-dimensional data. The nonconvexity of the fixed rank constraint in traditional PCA is addressed using the Fantope relaxation, transforming the problem into a convex minimax optimization. The Mirror Prox algorithm is utilized to solve the relaxed formulation, ensuring global convergence with a specified convergence rate. Practical criteria are provided to evaluate the solution's proximity to the original nonconvex formulation. Through numerical experiments, StablePCA is shown to accurately and efficiently extract robust low-dimensional representations across various finite-sample scenarios. This method facilitates the extraction of low-dimensional features that can effectively approximate original features across different sources, promoting the discovery of transferable knowledge, mitigating systematic biases, and enhancing fairness in data analysis. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: When synthesizing multisource high-dimensional data, a key objective is to extract low-dimensional feature representations that effectively approximate the original features across different sources. Such general feature extraction facilitates the discovery of transferable knowledge, mitigates systematic biases such as batch effects, and promotes fairness. In this paper, we propose Stable Principal Component Analysis (StablePCA), a novel method for group distributionally robust learning of latent representations from high-dimensional multi-source data. A primary challenge in generalizing PCA to the multi-source regime lies in the nonconvexity of the fixed rank constraint, rendering the minimax optimization nonconvex. To address this challenge, we employ the Fantope relaxation, reformulating the problem as a convex minimax optimization, with the objective defined as the maximum loss across sources. To solve the relaxed formulation, we devise an optimistic-gradient Mirror Prox algorithm with explicit closed-form updates. Theoretically, we establish the global convergence of the Mirror Prox algorithm, with the convergence rate provided from the optimization perspective. Furthermore, we offer practical criteria to assess how closely the solution approximates the original nonconvex formulation. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate StablePCA's high accuracy and efficiency in extracting robust low-dimensional representations across various finite-sample scenarios.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT) for time series anomaly detection. FreCT addresses the challenges faced by reconstruction-based techniques by incorporating frequency analysis through Fourier transformation to capture characteristics beyond the time domain. By utilizing patch operations and an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module, FreCT can effectively capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. To enhance model robustness, the proposed method deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for system monitoring and risk identification, across various domains, such as finance and healthcare. However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.

SGNN-IB applies information bottleneck theory to extract key characteristics of encoded representations, overcoming the issue of noise in the information propagation process.

arXiv:2505.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fraud detection is crucial in social service networks to maintain user trust and improve service network security. Existing spectral graph-based methods address this challenge by leveraging different graph filters to capture signals with different frequencies in service networks. However, most graph filter-based methods struggle with deriving clean and discriminative graph signals. On the one hand, they overlook the noise in the information propagation process, resulting in degradation of filtering ability. On the other hand, they fail to discriminate the frequency-specific characteristics of graph signals, leading to distortion of signals fusion. To address these issues, we develop a novel spectral graph network based on information bottleneck theory (SGNN-IB) for fraud detection in service networks. SGNN-IB splits the original graph into homophilic and heterophilic subgraphs to better capture the signals at different frequencies. For the first limitation, SGNN-IB applies information bottleneck theory to extract key characteristics of encoded representations. For the second limitation, SGNN-IB introduces prototype learning to implement signal fusion, preserving the frequency-specific characteristics of signals. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SGNN-IB outperforms state-of-the-art fraud detection methods.

Summary:
In the realm of neural network verification, formal verification techniques are crucial for ensuring quality and reliability. The state-of-the-art approach, Branch and Bound (BaB), has shown effectiveness but lacks efficiency due to its simplistic exploration strategy. To address this limitation, a novel verification method called ABONN has been introduced. ABONN utilizes an adaptive exploration approach inspired by Monte-Carlo tree search, prioritizing sub-problems with higher likelihoods of containing counterexamples. This strategy leads to significant speedups, with ABONN achieving up to 15.2 times faster verification on the MNIST dataset and 24.7 times faster on CIFAR-10 compared to baseline approaches. The study also delves into the impact of hyperparameters on ABONN's performance and highlights the efficacy of the adaptive tree exploration strategy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal verification is a rigorous approach that can provably ensure the quality of neural networks, and to date, Branch and Bound (BaB) is the state-of-the-art that performs verification by splitting the problem as needed and applying off-the-shelf verifiers to sub-problems for improved performance. However, existing BaB may not be efficient, due to its naive way of exploring the space of sub-problems that ignores the \emph{importance} of different sub-problems. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a notion of ``importance'' that reflects how likely a counterexample can be found with a sub-problem, and then we devise a novel verification approach, called ABONN, that explores the sub-problem space of BaB adaptively, in a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) style. The exploration is guided by the ``importance'' of different sub-problems, so it favors the sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples. As soon as it finds a counterexample, it can immediately terminate; even though it cannot find, after visiting all the sub-problems, it can still manage to verify the problem. We evaluate ABONN with 552 verification problems from commonly-used datasets and neural network models, and compare it with the state-of-the-art verifiers as baseline approaches. Experimental evaluation shows that ABONN demonstrates speedups of up to $15.2\times$ on MNIST and $24.7\times$ on CIFAR-10. We further study the influences of hyperparameters to the performance of ABONN, and the effectiveness of our adaptive tree exploration.

Summary: The article introduces a new approach, Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (TSW) distance, which enhances topological structure capturing in integration domains. The method utilizes nonlinear projections, ensuring the injectivity of Radon Transform and metric well-definedness. Efficient metrics for Euclidean spaces and spheres are constructed through appropriate projections.

arXiv:2505.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree-Sliced methods have recently emerged as an alternative to the traditional Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, replacing one-dimensional lines with tree-based metric spaces and incorporating a splitting mechanism for projecting measures. This approach enhances the ability to capture the topological structures of integration domains in Sliced Optimal Transport while maintaining low computational costs. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel nonlinear projectional framework for the Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (TSW) distance, substituting the linear projections in earlier versions with general projections, while ensuring the injectivity of the associated Radon Transform and preserving the well-definedness of the resulting metric. By designing appropriate projections, we construct efficient metrics for measures on both Euclidean spaces and spheres. Finally, we validate our proposed metric through extensive numerical experiments for Euclidean and spherical datasets. Applications include gradient flows, self-supervised learning, and generative models, where our methods demonstrate significant improvements over recent SW and TSW variants.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a framework for sequential decision-making in the presence of augmented predictions from machine learning algorithms. The decision-maker receives prediction intervals for unknown parameters that become more accurate over time. The proposed framework, minimax Markov Decision Process (minimax-MDP), involves an adversarially evolving environment state and an internal state controlled by the decision-maker. Future-imposed conditions are introduced to ensure feasibility and enable the design of robustly competitive policies. Three applications are discussed to illustrate the framework: multi-period inventory ordering with refining demand predictions, resource allocation with uncertain utility functions, and a multi-phase extension of the minimax-MDP for inventory problems with changing ordering costs. The results provide a tractable approach to robust online decision-making under predictive uncertainty.<br /> <div>

Abstract: We study a class of sequential decision-making problems with augmented predictions, potentially provided by a machine learning algorithm. In this setting, the decision-maker receives prediction intervals for unknown parameters that become progressively refined over time, and seeks decisions that are competitive with the hindsight optimal under all possible realizations of both parameters and predictions. We propose a minimax Markov Decision Process (minimax-MDP) framework, where the system state consists of an adversarially evolving environment state and an internal state controlled by the decision-maker. We introduce a set of future-imposed conditions that characterize the feasibility of minimax-MDPs and enable the design of efficient, often closed-form, robustly competitive policies. We illustrate the framework through three applications: multi-period inventory ordering with refining demand predictions, resource allocation with uncertain utility functions, and a multi-phase extension of the minimax-MDP applied to the inventory problem with time-varying ordering costs. Our results provide a tractable and versatile approach to robust online decision-making under predictive uncertainty.

Summary:
The article introduces a new hybrid order optimizer, FOSI, which combines gradient and curvature information to accelerate deep neural network (DNN) training. The distributed design, DHO$_2$, optimizes the calculation of curvature information and model update to reduce memory burden and speed up training. A novel strategy is implemented to parallelize these processes on multiple devices, leading to a linear reduction in memory burden and a significant speedup in training time compared to conventional optimizers. The distributed design achieves a memory burden reduction and a speedup ranging from 1.4x to 2.1x when compared to other distributed designs using conventional optimizers. This approach provides a promising solution for accelerating DNN training in resource-constrained settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling deep neural network (DNN) training to more devices can reduce time-to-solution. However, it is impractical for users with limited computing resources. FOSI, as a hybrid order optimizer, converges faster than conventional optimizers by taking advantage of both gradient information and curvature information when updating the DNN model. Therefore, it provides a new chance for accelerating DNN training in the resource-constrained setting. In this paper, we explore its distributed design, namely DHO$_2$, including distributed calculation of curvature information and model update with partial curvature information to accelerate DNN training with a low memory burden. To further reduce the training time, we design a novel strategy to parallelize the calculation of curvature information and the model update on different devices. Experimentally, our distributed design can achieve an approximate linear reduction of memory burden on each device with the increase of the device number. Meanwhile, it achieves $1.4\times\sim2.1\times$ speedup in the total training time compared with other distributed designs based on conventional first- and second-order optimizers.

<div> Keywords: DiGraph Neural Networks, Knowledge Distillation, Hierarchical Knowledge Tree, Mutual Information, (Di)graph datasets

Summary:
The article introduces EDEN (Entropy-driven Digraph Knowledge Distillation), a new paradigm for data-centric learning in directed graphs. EDEN utilizes hierarchical encoding theory to construct a Hierarchical Knowledge Tree (HKT) based on directed structural measurements. It quantifies mutual information of node profiles to refine knowledge flow in the HKT, facilitating data-centric Knowledge Distillation (KD) supervision during model training. EDEN significantly improves predictive performance for DiGraph Neural Networks (DiGNNs) by leveraging the correlations between directed edges and node profiles. The framework extends naturally to undirected scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art results across 14 (di)graph datasets and 4 downstream tasks. Overall, EDEN demonstrates superior performance, highlighting the importance of exploring data-centric approaches for enhancing model-centric neural networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directed graph (digraph), as a generalization of undirected graphs, exhibits superior representation capability in modeling complex topology systems and has garnered considerable attention in recent years. Despite the notable efforts made by existing DiGraph Neural Networks (DiGNNs) to leverage directed edges, they still fail to comprehensively delve into the abundant data knowledge concealed in the digraphs. This data-level limitation results in model-level sub-optimal predictive performance and underscores the necessity of further exploring the potential correlations between the directed edges (topology) and node profiles (feature and labels) from a data-centric perspective, thereby empowering model-centric neural networks with stronger encoding capabilities.
  In this paper, we propose \textbf{E}ntropy-driven \textbf{D}igraph knowl\textbf{E}dge distillatio\textbf{N} (EDEN), which can serve as a data-centric digraph learning paradigm or a model-agnostic hot-and-plug data-centric Knowledge Distillation (KD) module. The core idea is to achieve data-centric ML, guided by our proposed hierarchical encoding theory for structured data. Specifically, EDEN first utilizes directed structural measurements from a topology perspective to construct a coarse-grained Hierarchical Knowledge Tree (HKT). Subsequently, EDEN quantifies the mutual information of node profiles to refine knowledge flow in the HKT, enabling data-centric KD supervision within model training. As a general framework, EDEN can also naturally extend to undirected scenarios and demonstrate satisfactory performance. In our experiments, EDEN has been widely evaluated on 14 (di)graph datasets (homophily and heterophily) and across 4 downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that EDEN attains SOTA performance and exhibits strong improvement for prevalent (Di)GNNs.

Summary: 
Continual Test-time adaptation (CTTA) continuously adapts the deployed model on incoming data batches. However, existing CTTA approaches are often not feasible on edge devices due to high memory and energy consumption. To address this, a novel paradigm of on-demand TTA is introduced, triggering adaptation only when significant domain shift is detected. The OD-TTA framework incorporates lightweight domain shift detection, selection of an appropriate source model for adaptation, and a decoupled Batch Normalization update scheme for memory-efficient adaptation. Experimental results show that OD-TTA achieves comparable or better performance while significantly reducing energy and computation overhead, making Test-time adaptation a practical solution for edge devices.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Continual Test-time adaptation (CTTA) continuously adapts the deployed model on every incoming batch of data. While achieving optimal accuracy, existing CTTA approaches present poor real-world applicability on resource-constrained edge devices, due to the substantial memory overhead and energy consumption. In this work, we first introduce a novel paradigm -- on-demand TTA -- which triggers adaptation only when a significant domain shift is detected. Then, we present OD-TTA, an on-demand TTA framework for accurate and efficient adaptation on edge devices. OD-TTA comprises three innovative techniques: 1) a lightweight domain shift detection mechanism to activate TTA only when it is needed, drastically reducing the overall computation overhead, 2) a source domain selection module that chooses an appropriate source model for adaptation, ensuring high and robust accuracy, 3) a decoupled Batch Normalization (BN) update scheme to enable memory-efficient adaptation with small batch sizes. Extensive experiments show that OD-TTA achieves comparable and even better performance while reducing the energy and computation overhead remarkably, making TTA a practical reality.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel watermarking method for embedding ownership information into deep neural networks (DNNs) that is resistant to fine-tuning. The method involves proving that specific frequency components of a convolutional filter remain unchanged during the fine-tuning process when the input feature of a convolutional layer contains only low-frequency components. A revised Fourier transform is proposed to extract these frequency components from the convolutional filter, which are found to be invariant to weight scaling and permutations. A watermark module is designed to encode the ownership information into these specific frequency components. Initial experiments have shown promising results in terms of the method's effectiveness. <div>

Abstract: This paper proves a new watermarking method to embed the ownership information into a deep neural network (DNN), which is robust to fine-tuning. Specifically, we prove that when the input feature of a convolutional layer only contains low-frequency components, specific frequency components of the convolutional filter will not be changed by gradient descent during the fine-tuning process, where we propose a revised Fourier transform to extract frequency components from the convolutional filter. Additionally, we also prove that these frequency components are equivariant to weight scaling and weight permutations. In this way, we design a watermark module to encode the watermark information to specific frequency components in a convolutional filter. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

The article discusses the growing concern surrounding photorealistic images created by generative models due to their potential misuse in misinformation and fraud. Current detection methods often have limitations such as requiring access to model weights or extensive real image datasets. To address this issue, the authors introduce a novel black box detection framework that only requires API access. This framework utilizes a corrupt and recover strategy by masking part of an image to measure the model's ability to reconstruct it, indicating the likelihood that the image was generated by the model. For black-box models that do not support masked inputs, a cost-efficient surrogate model aligned with the target model distribution is incorporated for enhanced detection capability. The framework demonstrates strong performance, outperforming baseline methods by 4.31% in mean average precision across multiple diffusion model variant datasets. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic images created by generative models has sparked both excitement and concern, as these images are increasingly indistinguishable from real ones to the human eye. While offering new creative and commercial possibilities, the potential for misuse, such as in misinformation and fraud, highlights the need for effective detection methods. Current detection approaches often rely on access to model weights or require extensive collections of real image datasets, limiting their scalability and practical application in real world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel black box detection framework that requires only API access, sidestepping the need for model weights or large auxiliary datasets. Our approach leverages a corrupt and recover strategy: by masking part of an image and assessing the model ability to reconstruct it, we measure the likelihood that the image was generated by the model itself. For black-box models that do not support masked image inputs, we incorporate a cost efficient surrogate model trained to align with the target model distribution, enhancing detection capability. Our framework demonstrates strong performance, outperforming baseline methods by 4.31% in mean average precision across eight diffusion model variant datasets.

Summary:
Stagnation in evolutionary algorithms can actually aid in the convergence of the entire population, challenging the common belief that stagnation hinders progress. The study suggests that convergence does not necessarily indicate optimality, not even local optimality. It is important to note that simply achieving convergence is not enough to ensure the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms. The paper presents several counterexamples to illustrate this point, emphasizing that a more nuanced understanding of stagnation and convergence is crucial for improving the performance of evolutionary computation methods. <div>

Abstract: In the evolutionary computation community, it is widely believed that stagnation impedes convergence in evolutionary algorithms, and that convergence inherently indicates optimality. However, this perspective is misleading. In this study, it is the first to highlight that the stagnation of an individual can actually facilitate the convergence of the entire population, and convergence does not necessarily imply optimality, not even local optimality. Convergence alone is insufficient to ensure the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms. Several counterexamples are provided to illustrate this argument.

Summary: 
Actor-critic methods, especially single-timescale algorithms, have shown impressive performance in various tasks, yet their theoretical understanding remains challenging. Existing studies often focus on rare variants, but this research delves into the classic single-sample single-timescale actor-critic on continuous state-action space, using the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem as a benchmark. The study demonstrates that the single-timescale actor-critic can achieve an epsilon-optimal solution with a sample complexity of epsilon to -2 for solving LQR on continuous state-action space. This finding sheds new light on the performance of single-timescale actor-critic algorithms, bridging the gap between theoretical analysis and practical applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Actor-critic methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various challenging tasks. However, theoretical understandings of their performance remain elusive and challenging. Existing studies mostly focus on practically uncommon variants such as double-loop or two-timescale stepsize actor-critic algorithms for simplicity. These results certify local convergence on finite state- or action-space only. We push the boundary to investigate the classic single-sample single-timescale actor-critic on continuous (infinite) state-action space, where we employ the canonical linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem as a case study. We show that the popular single-timescale actor-critic can attain an epsilon-optimal solution with an order of epsilon to -2 sample complexity for solving LQR on the demanding continuous state-action space. Our work provides new insights into the performance of single-timescale actor-critic, which further bridges the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the substantial hardware resources required for their training present a significant barrier to efficiency and scalability. To mitigate this challenge, low-precision training techniques have been widely adopted, leading to notable advancements in training efficiency. Despite these gains, low-precision training involves several components$\unicode{x2013}$such as weights, activations, and gradients$\unicode{x2013}$each of which can be represented in different numerical formats. The resulting diversity has created a fragmented landscape in low-precision training research, making it difficult for researchers to gain a unified overview of the field. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing low-precision training methods. To systematically organize these approaches, we categorize them into three primary groups based on their underlying numerical formats, which is a key factor influencing hardware compatibility, computational efficiency, and ease of reference for readers. The categories are: (1) fixed-point and integer-based methods, (2) floating-point-based methods, and (3) customized format-based methods. Additionally, we discuss quantization-aware training approaches, which share key similarities with low-precision training during forward propagation. Finally, we highlight several promising research directions to advance this field. A collection of papers discussed in this survey is provided in https://github.com/Hao840/Awesome-Low-Precision-Training.

Keywords: model, consistency, diffusion, analysis, convergence
<br /><br />Summary:
In this work, the authors provide an analysis of consistency models, a new alternative to traditional diffusion models, showing that they offer accelerated generation of high-quality samples in few steps. They demonstrate that a consistency model can achieve KL divergence of order $O(\varepsilon^2)$ with only $O\left(\log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right)$ iterations using constant step size. They also show that under minimal assumptions on data distribution, similar KL convergence guarantees can be obtained in $O\left(d \log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right)$ steps. Theoretical analysis for estimation of consistency models concludes that accurate learning is possible with small discretization steps in smooth and non-smooth settings. Notably, the results for the non-smooth case demonstrate superior convergence rates compared to existing SDE or ODE based analyses with minimal assumptions. <div>

Abstract: Consistency models have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional SDE based diffusion models, offering a significant acceleration in generation by producing high quality samples in very few steps. Despite their empirical success, a proper theoretic justification for their speed up is still lacking. In this work, we provide the analysis which bridges this gap, showing that given a consistency model which can map the input at a given time to arbitrary timestamps along the reverse trajectory, one can achieve KL divergence of order $ O(\varepsilon^2) $ using only $ O\left(\log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right) $ iterations with constant step size, where d is the data dimension. Additionally, under minimal assumptions on the data distribution an increasingly common setting in recent diffusion model analyses we show that a similar KL convergence guarantee can be obtained, with the number of steps scaling as $ O\left(d \log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right) $. Going further, we also provide a theoretical analysis for estimation of such consistency models, concluding that accurate learning is feasible using small discretization steps, both in smooth and non smooth settings. Notably, our results for the non smooth case yield best in class convergence rates compared to existing SDE or ODE based analyses under minimal assumptions.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have emerged as powerful tools for modeling the responses of complex nonlinear materials directly from experimental measurements. Among these methods, the data-driven constitutive models present advantages in physical interpretability and generalizability across different boundary conditions/domain settings. However, the well-posedness of these learned models is generally not guaranteed a priori, which makes the models prone to non-physical solutions in downstream simulation tasks. In this study, we introduce monotone peridynamic neural operator (MPNO), a novel data-driven nonlocal constitutive model learning approach based on neural operators. Our approach learns a nonlocal kernel together with a nonlinear constitutive relation, while ensuring solution uniqueness through a monotone gradient network. This architectural constraint on gradient induces convexity of the learnt energy density function, thereby guaranteeing solution uniqueness of MPNO in small deformation regimes. To validate our approach, we evaluate MPNO's performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. On synthetic datasets with manufactured kernel and constitutive relation, we show that the learnt model converges to the ground-truth as the measurement grid size decreases both theoretically and numerically. Additionally, our MPNO exhibits superior generalization capabilities than the conventional neural networks: it yields smaller displacement solution errors in down-stream tasks with new and unseen loadings. Finally, we showcase the practical utility of our approach through applications in learning a homogenized model from molecular dynamics data, highlighting its expressivity and robustness in real-world scenarios.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge distillation, Early-Exit Neural Networks, group fairness, Laplace approximation, MultiNLI dataset

Summary: 
Knowledge distillation is a technique used to train compact student models using larger teacher models. Teacher models have richer feature representations, leading to potential fairness issues when labels correlate with specific input attributes. Early-Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) have been used to address this by enabling predictions at multiple intermediate layers. This paper proposes using Laplace approximation-based methods to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates to reweight challenging instances and improve group fairness. Laplace approximation is hypothesized to provide a more robust identification of difficult or ambiguous instances compared to margin-based approaches. The approach is benchmarked using a Bert-based model on the MultiNLI dataset. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a powerful tool for training compact student models using larger, pretrained teacher models, often requiring less data and computational resources. Teacher models typically possess more layers and thus exhibit richer feature representations compared to their student counterparts. Furthermore, student models tend to learn simpler, surface-level features in their early layers. This discrepancy can increase errors in groups where labels spuriously correlate with specific input attributes, leading to a decline in group fairness even when overall accuracy remains comparable to the teacher. To mitigate these challenges, Early-Exit Neural Networks (EENNs), which enable predictions at multiple intermediate layers, have been employed. Confidence margins derived from these early exits have been utilized to reweight both cross-entropy and distillation losses on a per-instance basis. In this paper, we propose that leveraging Laplace approximation-based methods to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates can also effectively reweight challenging instances and improve group fairness. We hypothesize that Laplace approximation offers a more robust identification of difficult or ambiguous instances compared to margin-based approaches. To validate our claims, we benchmark our approach using a Bert-based model on the MultiNLI dataset.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Federated Foundation Models (FedFM) as a privacy-preserving approach to fine-tune models in federated learning. A key challenge is addressing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, especially in FedFM where large parameter scales and data heterogeneity pose challenges. The proposed FedOA method utilizes adapter-based fine-tuning for efficient parameter usage and personalized adapters with feature distance-based regularization to ensure OOD generalization for each client. The global model in FedFM inherently has OOD generalization capabilities, and FedOA enhances personalized model OOD generalization through regularization informed by the global model. The method is proven to converge under general non-convex settings. Empirical validation on NLP tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of FedOA. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As foundation models gain prominence, Federated Foundation Models (FedFM) have emerged as a privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune models in federated learning (FL) frameworks using distributed datasets across clients. A key challenge for FedFM, given the versatile nature of foundation models, is addressing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where unseen tasks or clients may exhibit distribution shifts leading to suboptimal performance. Although numerous studies have explored OOD generalization in conventional FL, these methods are inadequate for FedFM due to the challenges posed by large parameter scales and increased data heterogeneity. To address these, we propose FedOA, which employs adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for efficacy and introduces personalized adapters with feature distance-based regularization to align distributions and guarantee OOD generalization for each client. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the conventional aggregated global model in FedFM inherently retains OOD generalization capabilities, and our proposed method enhances the personalized model's OOD generalization through regularization informed by the global model, with proven convergence under general non-convex settings. Empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on benchmark datasets across various NLP tasks.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a Stratonovich-based backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) formulation with stochastic Heun integration to address the performance gap observed in existing BSDE-based solvers compared to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The root cause of underperformance is attributed to a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme. The proposed Heun-based BSDE method eliminates this bias and outperforms EM-based variants, achieving competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. The integration scheme plays a crucial role in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an aspect that has not been adequately explored in the literature till now. This work sheds light on the significance of integration schemes for improving the computational efficiency and accuracy of BSDE-based deep learning methods in solving high-dimensional PDEs, particularly in stochastic optimal control applications. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)-based deep learning methods provide an alternative to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), offering algorithmic advantages in settings such as stochastic optimal control, where the PDEs of interest are tied to an underlying dynamical system. However, existing BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to short-horizon self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step sizes or longer self-consistency horizons. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.

Abstract: Many real-world problems (e.g., resource management, autonomous driving, drug discovery) require optimizing multiple, conflicting objectives. Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) extends classic reinforcement learning to handle multiple objectives simultaneously, yielding a set of policies that capture various trade-offs. However, the MORL field lacks complex, realistic environments and benchmarks. We introduce a water resource (Nile river basin) management case study and model it as a MORL environment. We then benchmark existing MORL algorithms on this task. Our results show that specialized water management methods outperform state-of-the-art MORL approaches, underscoring the scalability challenges MORL algorithms face in real-world scenarios.

Summary:  
Pipeline Parallelism (PP) enables training large neural networks on interconnected devices by splitting the model. Asynchronous optimization in PP offers 100% pipeline utilization but faces challenges due to stale gradients. A variant of Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) is introduced to address this issue by modifying the look-ahead step in NAG. The theoretical proof shows convergence at a sublinear rate with fixed delays in gradients. Experiments on large-scale language modeling tasks with up to 1B parameters using decoder-only architectures demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms existing asynchronous methods, even surpassing synchronous baselines. <div>

Abstract: Pipeline Parallelism (PP) enables large neural network training on small, interconnected devices by splitting the model into multiple stages. To maximize pipeline utilization, asynchronous optimization is appealing as it offers 100% pipeline utilization by construction. However, it is inherently challenging as the weights and gradients are no longer synchronized, leading to stale (or delayed) gradients. To alleviate this, we introduce a variant of Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) for asynchronous optimization in PP. Specifically, we modify the look-ahead step in NAG to effectively address the staleness in gradients. We theoretically prove that our approach converges at a sublinear rate in the presence of fixed delay in gradients. Our experiments on large-scale language modelling tasks using decoder-only architectures with up to 1B parameters, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing asynchronous methods, even surpassing the synchronous baseline.

Summary: <br />
The Competitive/Collaborative Fusion of Experts (CoCoAFusE) is a novel Bayesian Covariates-Dependent Modeling technique addressing uncertainty in learning problems with multiple patterns. It blends predictions from simple sub-models to achieve high expressiveness and local interpretability. Unlike classical Mixtures of Experts (MoEs), CoCoAFusE considers the fusion of experts' distributions, leading to tighter credible bounds on the response variable, thus avoiding multimodality artifacts. This approach enhances model flexibility and expressiveness, demonstrated through numerical and real-data examples. CoCoAFusE showcases efficacy in tackling complex regression problems with a focus on uncertainty, contributing to advances in model interpretability and Uncertainty Quantification. <div>
arXiv:2505.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many learning problems involve multiple patterns and varying degrees of uncertainty dependent on the covariates. Advances in Deep Learning (DL) have addressed these issues by learning highly nonlinear input-output dependencies. However, model interpretability and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) have often straggled behind. In this context, we introduce the Competitive/Collaborative Fusion of Experts (CoCoAFusE), a novel, Bayesian Covariates-Dependent Modeling technique. CoCoAFusE builds on the very philosophy behind Mixtures of Experts (MoEs), blending predictions from several simple sub-models (or "experts") to achieve high levels of expressiveness while retaining a substantial degree of local interpretability. Our formulation extends that of a classical Mixture of Experts by contemplating the fusion of the experts' distributions in addition to their more usual mixing (i.e., superimposition). Through this additional feature, CoCoAFusE better accommodates different scenarios for the intermediate behavior between generating mechanisms, resulting in tighter credible bounds on the response variable. Indeed, only resorting to mixing, as in classical MoEs, may lead to multimodality artifacts, especially over smooth transitions. Instead, CoCoAFusE can avoid these artifacts even under the same structure and priors for the experts, leading to greater expressiveness and flexibility in modeling. This new approach is showcased extensively on a suite of motivating numerical examples and a collection of real-data ones, demonstrating its efficacy in tackling complex regression problems where uncertainty is a key quantity of interest.

Abstract: With the advent of score-matching techniques for model training and Langevin dynamics for sample generation, energy-based models (EBMs) have gained renewed interest as generative models. Recent EBMs usually use neural networks to define their energy functions. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid approach that combines an EBM with an exponential family model to incorporate inductive bias into data modeling. Specifically, we augment the energy term with a parameter-free statistic function to help the model capture key data statistics. Like an exponential family model, the hybrid model aims to align the distribution statistics with data statistics during model training, even when it only approximately maximizes the data likelihood. This property enables us to impose constraints on the hybrid model. Our empirical study validates the hybrid model's ability to match statistics. Furthermore, experimental results show that data fitting and generation improve when suitable informative statistics are incorporated into the hybrid model.

The article introduces a new framework called Justice that integrates Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) with Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL) to address the limitations of traditional IAMs in capturing trade-offs among economic growth, temperature goals, and climate justice. By incorporating multiple objectives and using multiple agents, Justice generates policy recommendations that balance climate and economic goals while shedding light on equity considerations. The framework identifies equitable Pareto-optimal policies, facilitating deliberative decision-making by presenting policymakers with the inherent trade-offs in climate and economic policy. This new approach aims to improve the accuracy and fairness of policy recommendations related to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing climate change requires coordinated policy efforts of nations worldwide. These efforts are informed by scientific reports, which rely in part on Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), prominent tools used to assess the economic impacts of climate policies. However, traditional IAMs optimize policies based on a single objective, limiting their ability to capture the trade-offs among economic growth, temperature goals, and climate justice. As a result, policy recommendations have been criticized for perpetuating inequalities, fueling disagreements during policy negotiations. We introduce Justice, the first framework integrating IAM with Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL). By incorporating multiple objectives, Justice generates policy recommendations that shed light on equity while balancing climate and economic goals. Further, using multiple agents can provide a realistic representation of the interactions among the diverse policy actors. We identify equitable Pareto-optimal policies using our framework, which facilitates deliberative decision-making by presenting policymakers with the inherent trade-offs in climate and economic policy.

Summary:
The paper addresses the challenge of deploying machine learning models in the presence of adversarial actions by proposing a versatile framework for evaluating model robustness. Initially focusing on Support Vector Regression (SVR), the approach can be extended to various learning techniques based on relaxed optimization. The framework allows for the assessment of model vulnerability without the need for additional test data and operates in a distribution-free setup. These results provide a tool to enhance trust in the model's applicability and aid in decision-making among competing alternatives. Additionally, the findings offer insights for advancing results within the out-of-distribution framework. <div>
arXiv:2505.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning models capable of providing reliable predictions in the face of adversarial actions has become a central focus of the machine learning community in recent years. This challenge arises from observing that data encountered at deployment time often deviate from the conditions under which the model was trained. In this paper, we address deployment-time adversarial actions and propose a versatile, well-principled framework to evaluate the model's robustness against attacks of diverse types and intensities. While we initially focus on Support Vector Regression (SVR), the proposed approach extends naturally to the broad domain of learning via relaxed optimization techniques. Our results enable an assessment of the model vulnerability without requiring additional test data and operate in a distribution-free setup. These results not only provide a tool to enhance trust in the model's applicability but also aid in selecting among competing alternatives. Later in the paper, we show that our findings also offer useful insights for establishing new results within the out-of-distribution framework.

<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces the Consensus of Dependent Experts (CoDE) method for aggregating single-modality distributions in multimodal learning with variational autoencoders (VAEs). Unlike current methods, CoDE considers the dependence between modalities, leading to a more accurate estimation of the joint likelihood of multimodal data. The CoDE-VAE model shows improved performance in balancing generative coherence and quality, as well as generating more precise log-likelihood estimations. It also minimizes the generative quality gap with increasing modalities, approaching the quality of unimodal VAEs. Additionally, the classification accuracy of CoDE-VAE is comparable to state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models.

Abstract: Multimodal learning with variational autoencoders (VAEs) requires estimating joint distributions to evaluate the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Current methods, the product and mixture of experts, aggregate single-modality distributions assuming independence for simplicity, which is an overoptimistic assumption. This research introduces a novel methodology for aggregating single-modality distributions by exploiting the principle of consensus of dependent experts (CoDE), which circumvents the aforementioned assumption. Utilizing the CoDE method, we propose a novel ELBO that approximates the joint likelihood of the multimodal data by learning the contribution of each subset of modalities. The resulting CoDE-VAE model demonstrates better performance in terms of balancing the trade-off between generative coherence and generative quality, as well as generating more precise log-likelihood estimations. CoDE-VAE further minimizes the generative quality gap as the number of modalities increases. In certain cases, it reaches a generative quality similar to that of unimodal VAEs, which is a desirable property that is lacking in most current methods. Finally, the classification accuracy achieved by CoDE-VAE is comparable to that of state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models.

It incorporates advanced cross-modality alignment techniques to effectively combine textual and numerical data for enhanced comprehension. The model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on fifteen datasets, demonstrating the benefits of leveraging textual information in time series analysis. By addressing the limitations of single-modal models and highlighting the importance of integrating textual insights, Dual-Forecaster paves the way for a new approach to multimodal time series forecasting. <div>

Abstract: Most existing single-modal time series models rely solely on numerical series, which suffer from the limitations imposed by insufficient information. Recent studies have revealed that multimodal models can address the core issue by integrating textual information. However, these models focus on either historical or future textual information, overlooking the unique contributions each plays in time series forecasting. Besides, these models fail to grasp the intricate relationships between textual and time series data, constrained by their moderate capacity for multimodal comprehension. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dual-Forecaster, a pioneering multimodal time series model that combines both descriptively historical textual information and predictive textual insights, leveraging advanced multimodal comprehension capability empowered by three well-designed cross-modality alignment techniques. Our comprehensive evaluations on fifteen multimodal time series datasets demonstrate that Dual-Forecaster is a distinctly effective multimodal time series model that outperforms or is comparable to other state-of-the-art models, highlighting the superiority of integrating textual information for time series forecasting. This work opens new avenues in the integration of textual information with numerical time series data for multimodal time series analysis.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the growing computational challenges of power grid simulations, particularly with the increasing integration of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. As grid operators must analyze significantly more scenarios in near real-time to prevent failures and ensure stability, traditional physical-based simulations become computationally impractical. To tackle this, a competition was organized to develop AI-driven methods that accelerate power flow simulations by at least an order of magnitude while maintaining operational reliability. This competition utilized a regional-scale grid model with a 30\% renewable energy mix, mirroring the anticipated near-future composition of the French power grid. A key contribution of this work is through the use of LIPS (Learning Industrial Physical Systems), a benchmarking framework that evaluates solutions based on four critical dimensions: machine learning performance, physical compliance, industrial readiness, and generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Machine Learning for Physical Simulation (ML4PhySim) competition, detailing the benchmark suite, analyzing top-performing solutions that outperformed traditional simulation methods, and sharing key organizational insights and best practices for running large-scale AI competitions. Given the promising results achieved, the study aims to inspire further research into more efficient, scalable, and sustainable power network simulation methodologies.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces TActiLE, a novel Active Learning (AL) algorithm designed for the context of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) on wearable devices, specifically smart glasses. The algorithm aims to minimize the labeling effort by selecting a small subset of unlabeled data from on-device sensor streams for the user to label and add to the training set. This addresses the challenge of scarce labeled data collected on-device. TActiLE is the first AL technique tailored for TinyML applications and has been evaluated through experiments on image classification datasets. The results show that TActiLE is effective and efficient for tiny and wearable devices, enabling the development of personalized models that can adapt based on user data. <div>

Abstract: Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) algorithms have seen extensive use in recent years, enabling wearable devices to be not only connected but also genuinely intelligent by running machine learning (ML) computations directly on-device. Among such devices, smart glasses have particularly benefited from TinyML advancements. TinyML facilitates the on-device execution of the inference phase of ML algorithms on embedded and wearable devices, and more recently, it has expanded into On-device Learning (ODL), which allows both inference and learning phases to occur directly on the device. The application of ODL techniques to wearable devices is particularly compelling, as it enables the development of more personalized models that adapt based on the data of the user. However, one of the major challenges of ODL algorithms is the scarcity of labeled data collected on-device. In smart wearable contexts, requiring users to manually label large amounts of data is often impractical and could lead to user disengagement with the technology. To address this issue, this paper explores the application of Active Learning (AL) techniques, i.e., techniques that aim at minimizing the labeling effort, by actively selecting from a large quantity of unlabeled data only a small subset to be labeled and added to the training set of the algorithm. In particular, we propose TActiLE, a novel AL algorithm that selects from the stream of on-device sensor data the ones that would help the ML algorithm improve the most once coupled with labels provided by the user. TActiLE is the first Active Learning technique specifically designed for the TinyML context. We evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency through experiments on multiple image classification datasets. The results demonstrate its suitability for tiny and wearable devices.

<title>Empirical Comparison of Lightweight Forecasting Models for Seasonal and Non-Seasonal Time Series</title>

arXiv:2505.01163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate time series forecasting is essential in many real-time applications that demand both high predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. This study provides an empirical comparison between a Polynomial Classifier and a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) across four real-world time series datasets (weather conditions, gold prices, crude oil prices, and beer production volumes) that cover both seasonal and nonseasonal patterns. Model performance is evaluated by forecasting accuracy (using Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Squared Error) and computational time to assess each model's viability for real time forecasting. The results show that the PC yields more accurate and faster forecasts for non seasonal series, whereas the RBFNN performs better on series with pronounced seasonal patterns. From an interpretability standpoint, the polynomial model offers a simpler, more transparent structure (in contrast to the black box nature of neural network), which is advantageous for understanding and trust in real time decision making. The performance differences between PC and RBFNN are statistically significant, as confirmed by paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. These findings provide practical guidance for model selection in time series forecasting, indicating that PC may be preferable for quick, interpretable forecasts in non-seasonal contexts, whereas RBFNN is superior for capturing complex seasonal behaviors

<title>Harmonizing Intra-coherence and Inter-divergence in Ensemble Attacks for Adversarial Transferability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of model ensemble attacks has significantly improved the transferability of adversarial examples, but this progress also poses severe threats to the security of deep neural networks. Existing methods, however, face two critical challenges: insufficient capture of shared gradient directions across models and a lack of adaptive weight allocation mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose a novel method Harmonized Ensemble for Adversarial Transferability (HEAT), which introduces domain generalization into adversarial example generation for the first time. HEAT consists of two key modules: Consensus Gradient Direction Synthesizer, which uses Singular Value Decomposition to synthesize shared gradient directions; and Dual-Harmony Weight Orchestrator which dynamically balances intra-domain coherence, stabilizing gradients within individual models, and inter-domain diversity, enhancing transferability across models. Experimental results demonstrate that HEAT significantly outperforms existing methods across various datasets and settings, offering a new perspective and direction for adversarial attack research.

<title>Distilling Two-Timed Flow Models by Separately Matching Initial and Terminal Velocities</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01169</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flow matching model learns a time-dependent vector field $v_t(x)$ that generates a probability path $\{ p_t \}_{0 \leq t \leq 1}$ that interpolates between a well-known noise distribution ($p_0$) and the data distribution ($p_1$). It can be distilled into a \emph{two-timed flow model} (TTFM) $\phi_{s,x}(t)$ that can transform a sample belonging to the distribution at an initial time $s$ to another belonging to the distribution at a terminal time $t$ in one function evaluation. We present a new loss function for TTFM distillation called the \emph{initial/terminal velocity matching} (ITVM) loss that extends the Lagrangian Flow Map Distillation (LFMD) loss proposed by Boffi et al. by adding redundant terms to match the initial velocities at time $s$, removing the derivative from the terminal velocity term at time $t$, and using a version of the model under training, stabilized by exponential moving averaging (EMA), to compute the target terminal average velocity. Preliminary experiments show that our loss leads to better few-step generation performance on multiple types of datasets and model architectures over baselines.

Abstract: To improve crop forecasting and provide farmers with actionable data-driven insights, we propose a novel approach integrating IoT, machine learning, and blockchain technologies. Using IoT, real-time data from sensor networks continuously monitor environmental conditions and soil nutrient levels, significantly improving our understanding of crop growth dynamics. Our study demonstrates the exceptional accuracy of the Random Forest model, achieving a 99.45\% accuracy rate in predicting optimal crop types and yields, thereby offering precise crop projections and customized recommendations. To ensure the security and integrity of the sensor data used for these forecasts, we integrate the Ethereum blockchain, which provides a robust and secure platform. This ensures that the forecasted data remain tamper-proof and reliable. Stakeholders can access real-time and historical crop projections through an intuitive online interface, enhancing transparency and facilitating informed decision-making. By presenting multiple predicted crop scenarios, our system enables farmers to optimize production strategies effectively. This integrated approach promises significant advances in precision agriculture, making crop forecasting more accurate, secure, and user-friendly.

Abstract: Medical audio signals, such as heart and lung sounds, play a crucial role in clinical diagnosis. However, analyzing these signals remains challenging: traditional methods rely on handcrafted features or supervised deep learning models that demand extensive labeled datasets, limiting their scalability and applicability. To address these issues, we propose CaReAQA, an audio-language model that integrates a foundation audio model with the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling clinically relevant, open-ended diagnostic responses. Alongside CaReAQA, we introduce CaReSound, a benchmark dataset of annotated medical audio recordings enriched with metadata and paired question-answer examples, intended to drive progress in diagnostic reasoning research. Evaluation results show that CaReAQA achieves 86.2% accuracy on open-ended diagnostic reasoning tasks, outperforming baseline models. It also generalizes well to closed-ended classification tasks, achieving an average accuracy of 56.9% on unseen datasets. Our findings show how audio-language integration and reasoning advances medical diagnostics, enabling efficient AI systems for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Traditional Hopfield networks, using Hebbian learning, face severe storage capacity limits ($\approx 0.14$ P/N) and spurious attractors. Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) offers a non-linear approach, mapping patterns to high-dimensional feature spaces for improved separability. Our previous work showed KLR dramatically improves capacity and noise robustness over conventional methods. This paper quantitatively analyzes the attractor structures in KLR-trained networks via extensive simulations. We evaluated recall from diverse initial states across wide storage loads (up to 4.0 P/N) and noise levels. We quantified convergence rates and speed. Our analysis confirms KLR's superior performance: high capacity (up to 4.0 P/N) and robustness. The attractor landscape is remarkably "clean," with near-zero spurious fixed points. Recall failures under high load/noise are primarily due to convergence to other learned patterns, not spurious ones. Dynamics are exceptionally fast (typically 1-2 steps for high-similarity states). This characterization reveals how KLR reshapes dynamics for high-capacity associative memory, highlighting its effectiveness and contributing to AM understanding.

Abstract: The challenge of electronic component obsolescence is particularly critical in systems with long life cycles. Various obsolescence management methods are employed to mitigate its impact, with obsolescence forecasting being a highly sought-after and prominent approach. As a result, numerous machine learning-based forecasting methods have been proposed. However, machine learning models require a substantial amount of relevant data to achieve high precision, which is lacking in the current obsolescence landscape in some situations. This work introduces a novel framework for obsolescence forecasting based on deep learning. The proposed framework solves the lack of available data through deep generative modeling, where new obsolescence cases are generated and used to augment the training dataset. The augmented dataset is then used to train a classical machine learning-based obsolescence forecasting model. To train classical forecasting models using augmented datasets, existing classical supervised-learning classifiers are adapted for semi-supervised learning within this framework. The proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art results on benchmarking datasets.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting and swift inference provision are essential for intelligent transportation systems. However, the present Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based approaches cannot extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently, proven to yield less accurate forecasts. Besides, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast inference for traffic forecasting. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by leveraging heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected baselines.

Abstract: While data-driven methods such as neural operator have achieved great success in solving differential equations (DEs), they suffer from domain shift problems caused by different learning environments (with data bias or equation changes), which can be alleviated by transfer learning (TL). However, existing TL methods adopted in DEs problems lack either generalizability in general DEs problems or physics preservation during training. In this work, we focus on a general transfer learning method that adaptively correct the domain shift and preserve physical information. Mathematically, we characterize the data domain as product distribution and the essential problems as distribution bias and operator bias. A Physics-preserved Optimal Tensor Transport (POTT) method that simultaneously admits generalizability to common DEs and physics preservation of specific problem is proposed to adapt the data-driven model to target domain utilizing the push-forward distribution induced by the POTT map. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance, generalizability and physics preservation of the proposed POTT method.

Abstract: Accurate wind power forecasting can help formulate scientific dispatch plans, which is of great significance for maintaining the safety, stability, and efficient operation of the power system. In recent years, wind power forecasting methods based on deep learning have focused on extracting the spatiotemporal correlations among data, achieving significant improvements in forecasting accuracy. However, they exhibit two limitations. First, there is a lack of modeling for the inter-variable relationships, which limits the accuracy of the forecasts. Second, by treating endogenous and exogenous variables equally, it leads to unnecessary interactions between the endogenous and exogenous variables, increasing the complexity of the model. In this paper, we propose the 2DXformer, which, building upon the previous work's focus on spatiotemporal correlations, addresses the aforementioned two limitations. Specifically, we classify the inputs of the model into three types: exogenous static variables, exogenous dynamic variables, and endogenous variables. First, we embed these variables as variable tokens in a channel-independent manner. Then, we use the attention mechanism to capture the correlations among exogenous variables. Finally, we employ a multi-layer perceptron with residual connections to model the impact of exogenous variables on endogenous variables. Experimental results on two real-world large-scale datasets indicate that our proposed 2DXformer can further improve the performance of wind power forecasting. The code is available in this repository: \href{https://github.com/jseaj/2DXformer}{https://github.com/jseaj/2DXformer}.

Abstract: Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) have emerged as a pivotal tool in the smart home ecosystem, aiming to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and improve user comfort. By enabling intelligent control and optimization of household energy consumption, HEMS plays a significant role in bridging the gap between consumer needs and energy utility objectives. However, much of the existing literature construes consumer comfort as a mere deviation from the standard appliance settings. Such deviations are typically incorporated into optimization objectives via static weighting factors. These factors often overlook the dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and preferences. Addressing this oversight, our paper introduces a multi-mode Deep Reinforcement Learning-based HEMS (DRL-HEMS) framework, meticulously designed to optimize based on dynamic, consumer-defined preferences. Our primary goal is to augment consumer involvement in Demand Response (DR) programs by embedding dynamic multi-mode preferences tailored to individual appliances. In this study, we leverage a model-free, single-agent DRL algorithm to deliver a HEMS framework that is not only dynamic but also user-friendly. To validate its efficacy, we employed real-world data at 15-minute intervals, including metrics such as electricity price, ambient temperature, and appliances' power consumption. Our results show that the model performs exceptionally well in optimizing energy consumption within different preference modes. Furthermore, when compared to traditional algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), our model achieves nearly optimal performance while outperforming in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Parallel data collection has redefined Reinforcement Learning (RL), unlocking unprecedented efficiency and powering breakthroughs in large-scale real-world applications. In this paradigm, $N$ identical agents operate in $N$ replicas of an environment simulator, accelerating data collection by a factor of $N$. A critical question arises: \textit{Does specializing the policies of the parallel agents hold the key to surpass the $N$ factor acceleration?} In this paper, we introduce a novel learning framework that maximizes the entropy of collected data in a parallel setting. Our approach carefully balances the entropy of individual agents with inter-agent diversity, effectively minimizing redundancies. The latter idea is implemented with a centralized policy gradient method, which shows promise when evaluated empirically against systems of identical agents, as well as synergy with batch RL techniques that can exploit data diversity. Finally, we provide an original concentration analysis that shows faster rates for specialized parallel sampling distributions, which supports our methodology and may be of independent interest.

Abstract: We consider binary classification restricted to a class of continuous piecewise linear functions whose decision boundaries are (possibly nonconvex) starshaped polyhedral sets, supported on a fixed polyhedral simplicial fan. We investigate the expressivity of these function classes and describe the combinatorial and geometric structure of the loss landscape, most prominently the sublevel sets, for two loss-functions: the 0/1-loss (discrete loss) and an exponential loss function. In particular, we give explicit bounds on the VC dimension of this model, and concretely describe the sublevel sets of the discrete loss as chambers in a hyperplane arrangement. For the exponential loss, we give sufficient conditions for the optimum to be unique, and describe the geometry of the optimum when varying the rate parameter of the underlying exponential probability distribution.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to stabilize (LTS) a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Policy gradient (PG) methods for control assume access to an initial stabilizing policy. However, designing such a policy for an unknown system is one of the most fundamental problems in control, and it may be as hard as learning the optimal policy itself. Existing work on the LTS problem requires large data as it scales quadratically with the ambient dimension. We propose a two-phase approach that first learns the left unstable subspace of the system and then solves a series of discounted linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems on the learned unstable subspace, targeting to stabilize only the system's unstable dynamics and reduce the effective dimension of the control space. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for both phases and demonstrate that operating on the unstable subspace reduces sample complexity. In particular, when the number of unstable modes is much smaller than the state dimension, our analysis reveals that LTS on the unstable subspace substantially speeds up the stabilization process. Numerical experiments are provided to support this sample complexity reduction achieved by our approach.

<title>Stabilizing Temporal Difference Learning via Implicit Stochastic Approximation</title>

Abstract: Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, it is not without drawbacks, the most prominent being its sensitivity to step size. A poor choice of step size can dramatically inflate the error of value estimates and slow convergence. Consequently, in practice, researchers must use trial and error in order to identify a suitable step size -- a process that can be tedious and time consuming. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed-point equations. These updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, our theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds. Our results demonstrate their robustness and practicality for modern RL tasks, establishing implicit TD as a versatile tool for policy evaluation and value approximation.

<title>Evaluating Explanations: An Explanatory Virtues Framework for Mechanistic Interpretability -- The Strange Science Part I.ii</title>

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to understand neural networks through causal explanations. Though MI has many explanation-generating methods, progress has been limited by the lack of a universal approach to evaluating explanations. Here we analyse the fundamental question "What makes a good explanation?" We introduce a pluralist Explanatory Virtues Framework drawing on four perspectives from the Philosophy of Science - the Bayesian, Kuhnian, Deutschian, and Nomological - to systematically evaluate and improve explanations in MI. We find that Compact Proofs consider many explanatory virtues and are hence a promising approach. Fruitful research directions implied by our framework include (1) clearly defining explanatory simplicity, (2) focusing on unifying explanations and (3) deriving universal principles for neural networks. Improved MI methods enhance our ability to monitor, predict, and steer AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid growth of machine learning (ML) systems necessitates a more comprehensive evaluation of their environmental impact, particularly their carbon footprint, which comprises operational carbon from training and inference execution and embodied carbon from hardware manufacturing and its entire life-cycle. Despite the increasing importance of embodied emissions, there is a lack of tools and frameworks to holistically quantify and optimize the total carbon footprint of ML systems. To address this, we propose CATransformers, a carbon-aware architecture search framework that enables sustainability-driven co-optimization of ML models and hardware architectures. By incorporating both operational and embodied carbon metrics into early design space exploration of domain-specific hardware accelerators, CATransformers demonstrates that optimizing for carbon yields design choices distinct from those optimized solely for latency or energy efficiency. We apply our framework to multi-modal CLIP-based models, producing CarbonCLIP, a family of CLIP models achieving up to 17% reduction in total carbon emissions while maintaining accuracy and latency compared to state-of-the-art edge small CLIP baselines. This work underscores the need for holistic optimization methods to design high-performance, environmentally sustainable AI systems.

Abstract: We propose Derivative Learning (DERL), a supervised approach that models physical systems by learning their partial derivatives. We also leverage DERL to build physical models incrementally, by designing a distillation protocol that effectively transfers knowledge from a pre-trained to a student model. We provide theoretical guarantees that our approach can learn the true physical system, being consistent with the underlying physical laws, even when using empirical derivatives. DERL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizing an ODE to unseen initial conditions and a parametric PDE to unseen parameters. We finally propose a method based on DERL to transfer physical knowledge across models by extending them to new portions of the physical domain and new range of PDE parameters. We believe this is the first attempt at building physical models incrementally in multiple stages.

Abstract: Predicting the price that has the least error and can provide the best and highest accuracy has been one of the most challenging issues and one of the most critical concerns among capital market activists and researchers. Therefore, a model that can solve problems and provide results with high accuracy is one of the topics of interest among researchers. In this project, using time series prediction models such as ARIMA to estimate the price, variables, and indicators related to technical analysis show the behavior of traders involved in involving psychological factors for the model. By linking all of these variables to stepwise regression, we identify the best variables influencing the prediction of the variable. Finally, we enter the selected variables as inputs to the artificial neural network. In other words, we want to call this whole prediction process the "ARIMA_Stepwise Regression_Neural Network" model and try to predict the price of gold in international financial markets. This approach is expected to be able to be used to predict the types of stocks, commodities, currency pairs, financial market indicators, and other items used in local and international financial markets. Moreover, a comparison between the results of this method and time series methods is also expressed. Finally, based on the results, it can be seen that the resulting hybrid model has the highest accuracy compared to the time series method, regression, and stepwise regression.

Abstract: The Everglades play a crucial role in flood and drought regulation, water resource planning, and ecosystem management in the surrounding regions. However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water levels often face significant challenges, including high computational costs and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models achieving remarkable success in time series forecasting across various domains. Despite this progress, their application to critical environmental systems, such as the Everglades, remains underexplored. In this study, we fill the gap by investigating twelve task-specific models and five time series foundation models across six categories for a real-world application focused on water level prediction in the Everglades. Our primary results show that the foundation model, Chronos, significantly outperforms all other models while the remaining foundation models exhibit relatively poor performance. Moreover, the performance of task-specific models varies with the model architectures. Lastly, we discuss the possible reasons for the varying performance of models.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of frontier AI models scheming -- knowingly and covertly pursuing an objective misaligned with its developer's intentions. Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present eleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We demonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability safety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost certainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We run our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show concerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth.

<title>Computational, Data-Driven, and Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approaches for Microstructure Modeling in Metal Additive Manufacturing</title>

Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing enables unprecedented design freedom and the production of customized, complex components. However, the rapid melting and solidification dynamics inherent to metal AM processes generate heterogeneous, non-equilibrium microstructures that significantly impact mechanical properties and subsequent functionality. Predicting microstructure and its evolution across spatial and temporal scales remains a central challenge for process optimization and defect mitigation. While conventional experimental techniques and physics-based simulations provide a physical foundation and valuable insights, they face critical limitations. In contrast, data-driven machine learning offers an alternative prediction approach and powerful pattern recognition but often operate as black-box, lacking generalizability and physical consistency. To overcome these limitations, physics-informed machine learning, including physics-informed neural networks, has emerged as a promising paradigm by embedding governing physical laws into neural network architectures, thereby enhancing accuracy, transparency, data efficiency, and extrapolation capabilities. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of modeling strategies for microstructure prediction in metal AM. The strengths and limitations of experimental, computational, and data-driven methods are analyzed in depth, and highlight recent advances in hybrid PIML frameworks that integrate physical knowledge with ML. Key challenges, such as data scarcity, multi-scale coupling, and uncertainty quantification, are discussed alongside future directions. Ultimately, this assessment underscores the importance of PIML-based hybrid approaches in enabling predictive, scalable, and physically consistent microstructure modeling for site-specific, microstructure-aware process control and the reliable production of high-performance AM components.

Abstract: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is fundamental for advanced software development, supporting faster and more efficient delivery of code changes into cloud environments. However, security issues in the CI/CD pipeline remain challenging, and incidents (e.g., DDoS, Bot, Log4j, etc.) are happening over the cloud environments. While plenty of literature discusses static security testing and CI/CD practices, only a few deal with network traffic pattern analysis to detect different cyberattacks. This research aims to enhance CI/CD pipeline security by implementing anomaly detection through AI (Artificial Intelligence) support. The goal is to identify unusual behaviour or variations from network traffic patterns in pipeline and cloud platforms. The system shall integrate into the workflow to continuously monitor pipeline activities and cloud infrastructure. Additionally, it aims to explore adaptive response mechanisms to mitigate the detected anomalies or security threats. This research employed two popular network traffic datasets, CSE-CIC-IDS2018 and CSE-CIC-IDS2017. We implemented a combination of Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to detect unusual traffic patterns. We achieved an accuracy of 98.69% and 98.30% and generated log files in different CI/CD pipeline stages that resemble the network anomalies affected to address security challenges in modern DevOps practices, contributing to advancing software security and reliability.

Abstract: Moral stories are a time-tested vehicle for transmitting values, yet modern NLP lacks a large, structured corpus that couples coherent narratives with explicit ethical lessons. We close this gap with TF1-EN-3M, the first open dataset of three million English-language fables generated exclusively by instruction-tuned models no larger than 8B parameters. Each story follows a six-slot scaffold (character -> trait -> setting -> conflict -> resolution -> moral), produced through a combinatorial prompt engine that guarantees genre fidelity while covering a broad thematic space.
  A hybrid evaluation pipeline blends (i) a GPT-based critic that scores grammar, creativity, moral clarity, and template adherence with (ii) reference-free diversity and readability metrics. Among ten open-weight candidates, an 8B-parameter Llama-3 variant delivers the best quality-speed trade-off, producing high-scoring fables on a single consumer GPU (<24 GB VRAM) at approximately 13.5 cents per 1,000 fables.
  We release the dataset, generation code, evaluation scripts, and full metadata under a permissive license, enabling exact reproducibility and cost benchmarking. TF1-EN-3M opens avenues for research in instruction following, narrative intelligence, value alignment, and child-friendly educational AI, demonstrating that large-scale moral storytelling no longer requires proprietary giant models.

Abstract: Motivated by the emerging demand in the financial industry for the automatic analysis of unstructured and structured data at scale, Question Answering (QA) systems can provide lucrative and competitive advantages to companies by facilitating the decision making of financial advisers. Consequently, we propose a novel financial QA system using the transformer-based pre-trained BERT language model to address the limitations of data scarcity and language specificity in the financial domain. Our system focuses on financial non-factoid answer selection, which retrieves a set of passage-level texts and selects the most relevant as the answer. To increase efficiency, we formulate the answer selection task as a re-ranking problem, in which our system consists of an Answer Retriever using BM25, a simple information retrieval approach, to first return a list of candidate answers, and an Answer Re-ranker built with variants of pre-trained BERT language models to re-rank and select the most relevant answers. We investigate various learning, further pre-training, and fine-tuning approaches for BERT. Our experiments suggest that FinBERT-QA, a model built from applying the Transfer and Adapt further fine-tuning and pointwise learning approach, is the most effective, improving the state-of-the-art results of task 2 of the FiQA dataset by 16% on MRR, 17% on NDCG, and 21% on Precision@1.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel primality test based on the eigenvalue structure of circulant matrices constructed from roots of unity. We prove that an integer $n > 2$ is prime if and only if the minimal polynomial of the circulant matrix $C_n = W_n + W_n^2$ has exactly two irreducible factors over $\mathbb{Q}$. This characterization connects cyclotomic field theory with matrix algebra, providing both theoretical insights and practical applications. We demonstrate that the eigenvalue patterns of these matrices reveal fundamental distinctions between prime and composite numbers, leading to a deterministic primality test. Our approach leverages the relationship between primitive roots of unity, Galois theory, and the factorization of cyclotomic polynomials. We provide comprehensive experimental validation across various ranges of integers, discuss practical implementation considerations, and analyze the computational complexity of our method in comparison with established primality tests. The visual interpretation of our mathematical framework provides intuitive understanding of the algebraic structures that distinguish prime numbers. Our experimental validation demonstrates that our approach offers a deterministic alternative to existing methods, with performance characteristics reflecting its algebraic foundations.

Abstract: Advancements in remote sensing (RS) imagery have provided high-resolution detail and vast coverage, yet existing methods, such as image-level captioning/retrieval and object-level detection/segmentation, often fail to capture mid-scale semantic entities essential for interpreting large-scale scenes. To address this, we propose the conteXtual referring Map (XeMap) task, which focuses on contextual, fine-grained localization of text-referred regions in large-scale RS scenes. Unlike traditional approaches, XeMap enables precise mapping of mid-scale semantic entities that are often overlooked in image-level or object-level methods. To achieve this, we introduce XeMap-Network, a novel architecture designed to handle the complexities of pixel-level cross-modal contextual referring mapping in RS. The network includes a fusion layer that applies self- and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the interaction between text and image embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Scale Semantic Alignment (HMSA) module that aligns multiscale visual features with the text semantic vector, enabling precise multimodal matching across large-scale RS imagery. To support XeMap task, we provide a novel, annotated dataset, XeMap-set, specifically tailored for this task, overcoming the lack of XeMap datasets in RS imagery. XeMap-Network is evaluated in a zero-shot setting against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance. This highlights its effectiveness in accurately mapping referring regions and providing valuable insights for interpreting large-scale RS environments.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose a serious challenge to agriculture by reducing crop yield and affecting food quality. Early detection and classification of these diseases are essential for minimising losses and improving crop management practices. This study applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to classify plant leaf diseases using a dataset containing 70,295 training images and 17,572 validation images across 38 disease classes. The CNN model was trained using the Adam optimiser with a learning rate of 0.0001 and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. After 10 training epochs, the model achieved a training accuracy of 99.1% and a validation accuracy of 96.4%. The LSTM model reached a validation accuracy of 93.43%. Performance was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, confirming the reliability of the CNN-based approach. The results suggest that deep learning models, particularly CNN, enable an effective solution for accurate and scalable plant disease classification, supporting practical applications in agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Mobile video analysis systems often encounter various deploying environments, where environment shifts present greater demands for responsiveness in adaptations of deployed "expert DNN models". Existing model adaptation frameworks primarily operate in a cloud-centric way, exhibiting degraded performance during adaptation and delayed reactions to environment shifts. Instead, this paper proposes MOCHA, a novel framework optimizing the responsiveness of continuous model adaptation through hierarchical collaborations between mobile and cloud resources. Specifically, MOCHA (1) reduces adaptation response delays by performing on-device model reuse and fast fine-tuning before requesting cloud model retrieval and end-to-end retraining; (2) accelerates history expert model retrieval by organizing them into a structured taxonomy utilizing domain semantics analyzed by a cloud foundation model as indices; (3) enables efficient local model reuse by maintaining onboard expert model caches for frequent scenes, which proactively prefetch model weights from the cloud model database. Extensive evaluations with real-world videos on three DNN tasks show MOCHA improves the model accuracy during adaptation by up to 6.8% while saving the response delay and retraining time by up to 35.5x and 3.0x respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building fully autonomous agents. However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety. This paper provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these systems, including environment & profiling, human feedback, interaction types, orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses unique challenges and opportunities. By consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

Abstract: The kinematics of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been studied to understand the structure of dark matter halos. However, the kinematic information of these stars is often limited to celestial positions and line-of-sight velocities, making full phase space analysis challenging. Conventional methods rely on projected analytic phase space density models with several parameters and infer dark matter halo structures by solving the spherical Jeans equation. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning method for solving the spherical Jeans equation in a model-independent way as a first step toward model-independent analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Using equivariant continuous normalizing flows, we demonstrate that spherically symmetric stellar phase space densities and velocity dispersions can be estimated without model assumptions. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to Gaia challenge datasets for spherical models and measure dark matter mass densities given velocity anisotropy profiles. Our method can identify halo structures accurately, even with a small number of tracer stars.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled classical safe control methods, such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to generalize to complex robotic systems operating directly from high-dimensional sensor observations. However, obtaining comprehensive coverage of all safety-critical scenarios during world model training is extremely challenging. As a result, latent safety filters built on top of these models may miss novel hazards and even fail to prevent known ones, overconfidently misclassifying risky out-of-distribution (OOD) situations as safe. To address this, we introduce an uncertainty-aware latent safety filter that proactively steers robots away from both known and unseen failures. Our key idea is to use the world model's epistemic uncertainty as a proxy for identifying unseen potential hazards. We propose a principled method to detect OOD world model predictions by calibrating an uncertainty threshold via conformal prediction. By performing reachability analysis in an augmented state space-spanning both the latent representation and the epistemic uncertainty-we synthesize a latent safety filter that can reliably safeguard arbitrary policies from both known and unseen safety hazards. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our uncertainty-aware safety filter preemptively detects potential unsafe scenarios and reliably proposes safe, in-distribution actions.

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are complex and typically only simple systems can be analytically studied. In applications, these systems are usually defined with a set of tunable parameters and as the parameters are varied the system response undergoes significant topological changes or bifurcations. In a high dimensional parameter space, it is difficult to determine which direction to vary the system parameters to achieve a desired system response or state. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for optimally navigating a dynamical system parameter space that is rooted in topological data analysis. Specifically we use the differentiability of persistence diagrams to define a topological language for intuitively promoting or deterring different topological features in the state space response of a dynamical system and use gradient descent to optimally move from one point in the parameter space to another. The end result is a path in this space that guides the system to a set of parameters that yield the desired topological features defined by the loss function. We show a number of examples by applying the methods to different dynamical systems and scenarios to demonstrate how to promote different features and how to choose the hyperparameters to achieve different outcomes.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in areas that significantly impact human lives, concerns about fairness and transparency have grown, especially regarding their impact on protected groups. Recently, the intersection of explainability and fairness has emerged as an important area to promote responsible AI systems. This paper explores how explainability methods can be leveraged to detect and interpret unfairness. We propose a pipeline that integrates local post-hoc explanation methods to derive fairness-related insights. During the pipeline design, we identify and address critical questions arising from the use of explanations as bias detectors such as the relationship between distributive and procedural fairness, the effect of removing the protected attribute, the consistency and quality of results across different explanation methods, the impact of various aggregation strategies of local explanations on group fairness evaluations, and the overall trustworthiness of explanations as bias detectors. Our results show the potential of explanation methods used for fairness while highlighting the need to carefully consider the aforementioned critical aspects.

Abstract: Background: As empirical software engineering evolves, more studies adopt data strategies$-$approaches that investigate digital artifacts such as models, source code, or system logs rather than relying on human subjects. Synthesizing results from such studies introduces new methodological challenges.
  Aims: This study assesses the effects of model quantization on correctness and resource efficiency in deep learning (DL) systems. Additionally, it explores the methodological implications of aggregating evidence from empirical studies that adopt data strategies.
  Method: We conducted a research synthesis of six primary studies that empirically evaluate model quantization. We applied the Structured Synthesis Method (SSM) to aggregate the findings, which combines qualitative and quantitative evidence through diagrammatic modeling. A total of 19 evidence models were extracted and aggregated.
  Results: The aggregated evidence indicates that model quantization weakly negatively affects correctness metrics while consistently improving resource efficiency metrics, including storage size, inference latency, and GPU energy consumption$-$a manageable trade-off for many DL deployment contexts. Evidence across quantization techniques remains fragmented, underscoring the need for more focused empirical studies per technique.
  Conclusions: Model quantization offers substantial efficiency benefits with minor trade-offs in correctness, making it a suitable optimization strategy for resource-constrained environments. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of using SSM to synthesize findings from data strategy-based research.

Abstract: A clustered adaptive intervention (cAI) is a pre-specified sequence of decision rules that guides practitioners on how best - and based on which measures - to tailor cluster-level intervention to improve outcomes at the level of individuals within the clusters. A clustered sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (cSMART) is a type of trial that is used to inform the empirical development of a cAI. The most common type of secondary aim in a cSMART focuses on assessing causal effect moderation by candidate tailoring variables. We introduce a clustered Q-learning framework with the M-out-of-N Cluster Bootstrap using data from a cSMART to evaluate whether a set of candidate tailoring variables may be useful in defining an optimal cAI. This approach could construct confidence intervals (CI) with near-nominal coverage to assess parameters indexing the causal effect moderation function. Specifically, it allows reliable inferences concerning the utility of candidate tailoring variables in constructing a cAI that maximizes a mean end-of-study outcome even when "non-regularity", a well-known challenge exists. Simulations demonstrate the numerical performance of the proposed method across varying non-regularity conditions and investigate the impact of varying number of clusters and intra-cluster correlation coefficient on CI coverage. Methods are applied on ADEPT dataset to inform the construction of a clinic-level cAI for improving evidence-based practice in treating mood disorders.

Abstract: Appropriate modelling of extreme skew surges is crucial, particularly for coastal risk management. Our study focuses on modelling extreme skew surges along the French Atlantic coast, with a particular emphasis on investigating the extremal dependence structure between stations. We employ the peak-over-threshold framework, where a multivariate extreme event is defined whenever at least one location records a large value, though not necessarily all stations simultaneously. A novel method for determining an appropriate level (threshold) above which observations can be classified as extreme is proposed. Two complementary approaches are explored. First, the multivariate generalized Pareto distribution is employed to model extremes, leveraging its properties to derive a generative model that predicts extreme skew surges at one station based on observed extremes at nearby stations. Second, a novel extreme regression framework is assessed for point predictions. This specific regression framework enables accurate point predictions using only the "angle" of input variables, i.e. input variables divided by their norms. The ultimate objective is to reconstruct historical skew surge time series at stations with limited data. This is achieved by integrating extreme skew surge data from stations with longer records, such as Brest and Saint-Nazaire, which provide over 150 years of observations.

Abstract: Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC) is a low-cost machine learning method for forecasting chaotic time series from data. However, ensuring the dynamical stability of NGRC models during autonomous prediction remains a challenge. In this work, we uncover a key connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. Merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags and high-degree polynomials. Ill-conditioning amplifies sensitivity to training data perturbations, which can produce unstable NGRC dynamics. We evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, SVD, and LU) for solving the regularized least-squares problem.

Abstract: Driver assistance systems provide a wide range of crucial services, including closely monitoring the condition of vehicles. This paper showcases a groundbreaking sensor health monitoring system designed for the automotive industry. The ingenious system leverages cutting-edge techniques to process data collected from various vehicle sensors. It compares their outputs within the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to evaluate the health of each sensor. To unravel the intricate correlations between sensor data, an extensive exploration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies was conducted. Through meticulous analysis, the most correlated sensor data were identified. These valuable insights were then utilized to provide accurate estimations of sensor values. Among the diverse learning methods examined, the combination of autoencoders for detecting sensor failures and random forest regression for estimating sensor values proved to yield the most impressive outcomes. A statistical model using the normal distribution has been developed to identify possible sensor failures proactively. By comparing the actual values of the sensors with their estimated values based on correlated sensors, faulty sensors can be detected early. When a defective sensor is detected, both the driver and the maintenance department are promptly alerted. Additionally, the system replaces the value of the faulty sensor with the estimated value obtained through analysis. This proactive approach was evaluated using data from twenty essential sensors in the Saipa's Quick vehicle's ECU, resulting in an impressive accuracy rate of 99\%.

<title>Protocol-agnostic and Data-free Backdoor Attacks on Pre-trained Models in RF Fingerprinting</title>

Abstract: While supervised deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven effective for device authentication via radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, they are hindered by domain shift issues and the scarcity of labeled data. The success of large language models has led to increased interest in unsupervised pre-trained models (PTMs), which offer better generalization and do not require labeled datasets, potentially addressing the issues mentioned above. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of PTMs in RF fingerprinting remain insufficiently explored. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate data-free backdoor attacks on such PTMs in RF fingerprinting, focusing on a practical scenario where attackers lack access to downstream data, label information, and training processes. To realize the backdoor attack, we carefully design a set of triggers and predefined output representations (PORs) for the PTMs. By mapping triggers and PORs through backdoor training, we can implant backdoor behaviors into the PTMs, thereby introducing vulnerabilities across different downstream RF fingerprinting tasks without requiring prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the wide applicability of our proposed attack to various input domains, protocols, and PTMs. Furthermore, we explore potential detection and defense methods, demonstrating the difficulty of fully safeguarding against our proposed backdoor attack.

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large datasets is critical in applications such as drug discovery, precision medicine, and alignment of large language models (LLMs). While Conformal Selection (CS) provides rigorous uncertainty quantification, it is limited to univariate responses and scalar criteria. To address this issue, we propose Multivariate Conformal Selection (mCS), a generalization of CS designed for multivariate response settings. Our method introduces regional monotonicity and employs multivariate nonconformity scores to construct conformal p-values, enabling finite-sample False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. We present two variants: mCS-dist, using distance-based scores, and mCS-learn, which learns optimal scores via differentiable optimization. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that mCS significantly improves selection power while maintaining FDR control, establishing it as a robust framework for multivariate selection tasks.

<title>Dynamic and Distributed Routing in IoT Networks based on Multi-Objective Q-Learning</title>

Abstract: The last few decades have witnessed a rapid increase in IoT devices owing to their wide range of applications, such as smart healthcare monitoring systems, smart cities, and environmental monitoring. A critical task in IoT networks is sensing and transmitting information over the network. The IoT nodes gather data by sensing the environment and then transmit this data to a destination node via multi-hop communication, following some routing protocols. These protocols are usually designed to optimize possibly contradictory objectives, such as maximizing packet delivery ratio and energy efficiency. While most literature has focused on optimizing a static objective that remains unchanged, many real-world IoT applications require adapting to rapidly shifting priorities. For example, in monitoring systems, some transmissions are time-critical and require a high priority on low latency, while other transmissions are less urgent and instead prioritize energy efficiency. To meet such dynamic demands, we propose novel dynamic and distributed routing based on multiobjective Q-learning that can adapt to changes in preferences in real-time. Our algorithm builds on ideas from both multi-objective optimization and Q-learning. We also propose a novel greedy interpolation policy scheme to take near-optimal decisions for unexpected preference changes. The proposed scheme can approximate and utilize the Pareto-efficient solutions for dynamic preferences, thus utilizing past knowledge to adapt to unpredictable preferences quickly during runtime. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for various exploration strategies, preference variation patterns, and important metrics like overall reward, energy efficiency, and packet delivery ratio.

Abstract: We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems leverage powerful language models to generate personalized suggestions by processing user interactions and preferences. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely on structured data and collaborative filtering, LLM-based models process textual and contextual information, often using cloud-based infrastructure. This raises privacy concerns, as user data is transmitted to remote servers, increasing the risk of exposure and reducing control over personal information. To address this, we propose a hybrid privacy-preserving recommendation framework which separates sensitive from nonsensitive data and only shares the latter with the cloud to harness LLM-powered recommendations. To restore lost recommendations related to obfuscated sensitive data, we design a de-obfuscation module that reconstructs sensitive recommendations locally. Experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that our framework achieves almost the same recommendation utility with a system which shares all data with an LLM, while preserving privacy to a large extend. Compared to obfuscation-only techniques, our approach improves HR@10 scores and category distribution alignment, offering a better balance between privacy and recommendation quality. Furthermore, our method runs efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, making privacy-aware LLM-based recommendation systems practical for real-world use.

Abstract: User sequence modeling is crucial for modern large-scale recommendation systems, as it enables the extraction of informative representations of users and items from their historical interactions. These user representations are widely used for a variety of downstream tasks to enhance users' online experience. A key challenge for learning these representations is the lack of labeled training data. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have emerged as a promising solution for learning representations from unlabeled data, many existing approaches rely on extensive negative sampling, which can be computationally expensive and may not always be feasible in real-world scenario. In this work, we propose an adaptation of Barlow Twins, a state-of-the-art SSL methods, to user sequence modeling by incorporating suitable augmentation methods. Our approach aims to mitigate the need for large negative sample batches, enabling effective representation learning with smaller batch sizes and limited labeled data. We evaluate our method on the MovieLens-1M, MovieLens-20M, and Yelp datasets, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms the widely-used dual encoder model across three downstream tasks, achieving an 8%-20% improvement in accuracy. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of our approach in extracting valuable sequence-level information for user modeling, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce and negative examples are limited.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) for contextual bandit policies leverage historical data to evaluate and optimize a target policy. Most existing OPE/OPL methods--based on importance weighting or imputation--assume common support between the target and logging policies. When this assumption is violated, these methods typically require unstable extrapolation, truncation, or conservative strategies for individuals outside the common support assumption. However, such approaches can be inadequate in settings where explicit evaluation or optimization for such individuals is required. To address this issue, we propose DOLCE: Decomposing Off-policy evaluation/learning into Lagged and Current Effects, a novel estimator that leverages contextual information from multiple time points to decompose rewards into lagged and current effects. By incorporating both past and present contexts, DOLCE effectively handles individuals who violate the common support assumption. We show that the proposed estimator is unbiased under two assumptions--local correctness and conditional independence. Our experiments demonstrate that DOLCE achieves substantial improvements in OPE and OPL, particularly as the proportion of individuals outside the common support assumption increases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central to numerous natural language processing tasks, but their vulnerabilities present significant security and ethical challenges. This systematic survey explores the evolving landscape of attack and defense techniques in LLMs. We classify attacks into adversarial prompt attack, optimized attacks, model theft, as well as attacks on application of LLMs, detailing their mechanisms and implications. Consequently, we analyze defense strategies, including prevention-based and detection-based defense methods. Although advances have been made, challenges remain to adapt to the dynamic threat landscape, balance usability with robustness, and address resource constraints in defense implementation. We highlight open problems, including the need for adaptive scalable defenses, explainable security techniques, and standardized evaluation frameworks. This survey provides actionable insights and directions for developing secure and resilient LLMs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations to mitigate risks in real-world applications.

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) is critical in data analysis, particularly within the domain of IT security. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for AD in large-scale data. In this study, we explore the potential of quantum ML approaches, specifically quantum kernel methods, for the application to robust AD. We build upon previous work on Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) for semisupervised AD by conducting a comprehensive benchmark on IBM quantum hardware using eleven datasets. Our results demonstrate that QSVR achieves strong classification performance and even outperforms the noiseless simulation on two of these datasets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of - in the NISQ-era inevitable - quantum noise on the performance of the QSVR. Our findings reveal that the model exhibits robustness to depolarizing, phase damping, phase flip, and bit flip noise, while amplitude damping and miscalibration noise prove to be more disruptive. Finally, we explore the domain of Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning and demonstrate that QSVR is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that noise does not improve the adversarial robustness of the model.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the empirical sciences involves uncovering causal structure through observation and experimentation. Causal discovery entails linking the conditional independence (CI) invariances in observational data to their corresponding graphical constraints via d-separation. In this paper, we consider a general setting where we have access to data from multiple experimental distributions resulting from hard interventions, as well as potentially from an observational distribution. By comparing different interventional distributions, we propose a set of graphical constraints that are fundamentally linked to Pearl's do-calculus within the framework of hard interventions. These graphical constraints associate each graphical structure with a set of interventional distributions that are consistent with the rules of do-calculus. We characterize the interventional equivalence class of causal graphs with latent variables and introduce a graphical representation that can be used to determine whether two causal graphs are interventionally equivalent, i.e., whether they are associated with the same family of hard interventional distributions, where the elements of the family are indistinguishable using the invariances from do-calculus. We also propose a learning algorithm to integrate multiple datasets from hard interventions, introducing new orientation rules. The learning objective is a tuple of augmented graphs which entails a set of causal graphs. We also prove the soundness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) are increasingly deployed to offer advanced capabilities on inputs comprising both text and images. While prior research has shown that adversarial attacks can transfer from open-source to proprietary black-box models in text-only and vision-only contexts, the extent and effectiveness of such vulnerabilities remain underexplored for VLLMs. We present a comprehensive analysis demonstrating that targeted adversarial examples are highly transferable to widely-used proprietary VLLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini. We show that attackers can craft perturbations to induce specific attacker-chosen interpretations of visual information, such as misinterpreting hazardous content as safe, overlooking sensitive or restricted material, or generating detailed incorrect responses aligned with the attacker's intent. Furthermore, we discover that universal perturbations -- modifications applicable to a wide set of images -- can consistently induce these misinterpretations across multiple proprietary VLLMs. Our experimental results on object recognition, visual question answering, and image captioning show that this vulnerability is common across current state-of-the-art models, and underscore an urgent need for robust mitigations to ensure the safe and secure deployment of VLLMs.

Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) offers strong performance in nonlinear and contact-rich robotic tasks, yet often suffers from poor exploration due to locally greedy sampling schemes. We propose \emph{Model Tensor Planning} (MTP), a novel sampling-based MPC framework that introduces high-entropy control trajectory generation through structured tensor sampling. By sampling over randomized multipartite graphs and interpolating control trajectories with B-splines and Akima splines, MTP ensures smooth and globally diverse control candidates. We further propose a simple $\beta$-mixing strategy that blends local exploitative and global exploratory samples within the modified Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) update, balancing control refinement and exploration. Theoretically, we show that MTP achieves asymptotic path coverage and maximum entropy in the control trajectory space in the limit of infinite tensor depth and width.
  Our implementation is fully vectorized using JAX and compatible with MuJoCo XLA, supporting \emph{Just-in-time} (JIT) compilation and batched rollouts for real-time control with online domain randomization. Through experiments on various challenging robotic tasks, ranging from dexterous in-hand manipulation to humanoid locomotion, we demonstrate that MTP outperforms standard MPC and evolutionary strategy baselines in task success and control robustness. Design and sensitivity ablations confirm the effectiveness of MTP tensor sampling structure, spline interpolation choices, and mixing strategy. Altogether, MTP offers a scalable framework for robust exploration in model-based planning and control.

Abstract: Fine-grained Visual Recognition (FGVR) involves distinguishing between visually similar categories, which is inherently challenging due to subtle inter-class differences and the need for large, expert-annotated datasets. In domains like medical imaging, such curated datasets are unavailable due to issues like privacy concerns and high annotation costs. In such scenarios lacking labeled data, an FGVR model cannot rely on a predefined set of training labels, and hence has an unconstrained output space for predictions. We refer to this task as Vocabulary-Free FGVR (VF-FGVR), where a model must predict labels from an unconstrained output space without prior label information. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show potential for VF-FGVR, querying these models for each test input is impractical because of high costs and prohibitive inference times. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{Nea}rest-Neighbor Label \textbf{R}efinement (NeaR), a novel approach that fine-tunes a downstream CLIP model using labels generated by an MLLM. Our approach constructs a weakly supervised dataset from a small, unlabeled training set, leveraging MLLMs for label generation. NeaR is designed to handle the noise, stochasticity, and open-endedness inherent in labels generated by MLLMs, and establishes a new benchmark for efficient VF-FGVR.

Abstract: Digital Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have shown great promise in Deep Neural Network (DNN) acceleration by effectively addressing the "memory wall" bottleneck. However, the development and optimization of digital CIM accelerators are hindered by the lack of comprehensive tools that encompass both software and hardware design spaces. Moreover, existing design and evaluation frameworks often lack support for the capacity constraints inherent in digital CIM architectures. In this paper, we present CIMFlow, an integrated framework that provides an out-of-the-box workflow for implementing and evaluating DNN workloads on digital CIM architectures. CIMFlow bridges the compilation and simulation infrastructures with a flexible instruction set architecture (ISA) design, and addresses the constraints of digital CIM through advanced partitioning and parallelism strategies in the compilation flow. Our evaluation demonstrates that CIMFlow enables systematic prototyping and optimization of digital CIM architectures across diverse configurations, providing researchers and designers with an accessible platform for extensive design space exploration.

Abstract: When gradient-based methods are impractical, black-box optimization (BBO) provides a valuable alternative. However, BBO often struggles with high-dimensional problems and limited trial budgets. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on meta-learning to pre-compute a reduced-dimensional manifold where optimal points lie for a specific class of optimization problems. When optimizing a new problem instance sampled from the class, black-box optimization is carried out in the reduced-dimensional space, effectively reducing the effort required for finding near-optimal solutions.

Abstract: Atomistic modeling of thin-film processes provides an avenue not only for discovering key chemical mechanisms of the processes but also to extract quantitative metrics on the events and reactions taking place at the gas-surface interface. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational method to study the evolution of a process at the atomic scale, but studies of industrially relevant processes usually require suitable force fields, which are in general not available for all processes of interest. However, machine learned force fields (MLFF) are conquering the field of computational materials and surface science. In this paper, we demonstrate how to efficiently build MLFFs suitable for process simulations and provide two examples for technologically relevant processes: precursor pulse in the atomic layer deposition of HfO2 and atomic layer etching of MoS2.

Abstract: In software development, technical debt (TD) refers to suboptimal implementation choices made by the developers to meet urgent deadlines and limited resources, posing challenges for future maintenance. Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) is a sub-type of TD, representing specific TD instances ``openly admitted'' by the developers and often expressed through source code comments. Previous research on SATD has focused predominantly on the Java programming language, revealing a significant gap in cross-language SATD. Such a narrow focus limits the generalizability of existing findings as well as SATD detection techniques across multiple programming languages. Our work addresses such limitation by introducing CppSATD, a dedicated C++ SATD dataset, comprising over 531,000 annotated comments and their source code contexts. Our dataset can serve as a foundation for future studies that aim to develop SATD detection methods in C++, generalize the existing findings to other languages, or contribute novel insights to cross-language SATD research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is critical to assess the security threats and vulnerabilities that may arise both during their training phase and after models have been deployed. This survey seeks to define and categorize the various attacks targeting LLMs, distinguishing between those that occur during the training phase and those that affect already trained models. A thorough analysis of these attacks is presented, alongside an exploration of defense mechanisms designed to mitigate such threats. Defenses are classified into two primary categories: prevention-based and detection-based defenses. Furthermore, our survey summarizes possible attacks and their corresponding defense strategies. It also provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of the known defense mechanisms for the different security threats. Our survey aims to offer a structured framework for securing LLMs, while also identifying areas that require further research to improve and strengthen defenses against emerging security challenges.

<title>A flexible Bayesian non-parametric mixture model reveals multiple dependencies of swap errors in visual working memory</title>

Abstract: Human behavioural data in psychophysics has been used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of many cognitive processes, such as attention, sensorimotor integration, and perceptual decision making. Visual working memory has particularly benefited from this approach: analyses of VWM errors have proven crucial for understanding VWM capacity and coding schemes, in turn constraining neural models of both. One poorly understood class of VWM errors are swap errors, whereby participants recall an uncued item from memory. Swap errors could arise from erroneous memory encoding, noisy storage, or errors at retrieval time - previous research has mostly implicated the latter two. However, these studies made strong a priori assumptions on the detailed mechanisms and/or parametric form of errors contributed by these sources. Here, we pursue a data-driven approach instead, introducing a Bayesian non-parametric mixture model of swap errors (BNS) which provides a flexible descriptive model of swapping behaviour, such that swaps are allowed to depend on both the probed and reported features of every stimulus item. We fit BNS to the trial-by-trial behaviour of human participants and show that it recapitulates the strong dependence of swaps on cue similarity in multiple datasets. Critically, BNS reveals that this dependence coexists with a non-monotonic modulation in the report feature dimension for a random dot motion direction-cued, location-reported dataset. The form of the modulation inferred by BNS opens new questions about the importance of memory encoding in causing swap errors in VWM, a distinct source to the previously suggested binding and cueing errors. Our analyses, combining qualitative comparisons of the highly interpretable BNS parameter structure with rigorous quantitative model comparison and recovery methods, show that previous interpretations of swap errors may have been incomplete.

<title>EnviKal-Loc: Sub-10m Indoor LoRaWAN Localization using an Environmental-Aware Path Loss and Adaptive RSSI Smoothing</title>

Abstract: LoRaWAN technology's extensive coverage positions it as a strong contender for large-scale IoT deployments. However, achieving sub-10 m accuracy in indoor localization remains challenging due to complex environmental conditions, multipath fading, and transient obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight but robust approach combining adaptive filtering with an extended log-distance, multi-wall path loss and shadowing (PLS) model. Our methodology augments conventional models with critical LoRaWAN parameters (received signal strength indicator (RSSI), frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) and dynamic environmental indicators (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). An adaptive Kalman filter reduces RSSI fluctuations, isolating persistent trends from momentary noise. Using a six-month dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements, we evaluate three models: the baseline COST 231 multi-wall model (MWM), the baseline model augmented with environmental parameters (MWM-EP), and a forward-only adaptive Kalman-filtered RSSI version of the latter (MWM-EP-KF). Results confirm that the MWM-EP-KF achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.81 m, outperforming both the MWM-EP (10.56 m) and the baseline MWM framework (17.98 m). Environmental augmentation reduces systematic errors by 41.22%, while Kalman filtering significantly enhances robustness under high RSSI volatility by 42.63%, on average across all devices. These findings present an interpretable, efficient solution for precise indoor LoRaWAN localization in dynamically changing environments.

Abstract: Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for intelligent decision-making in vehicular networks, helping to address challenges such as limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and data heterogeneity. However, HFL remains vulnerable to adversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly compromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL architecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient ascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment for each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity analyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional deviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive thresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric, dynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each vehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing vehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented, which assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy vehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency check is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple compromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms form a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and 3-hop topologies.

<title>Gaussian Differential Private Bootstrap by Subsampling</title>

Abstract: Bootstrap is a common tool for quantifying uncertainty in data analysis. However, besides additional computational costs in the application of the bootstrap on massive data, a challenging problem in bootstrap based inference under Differential Privacy consists in the fact that it requires repeated access to the data. As a consequence, bootstrap based differentially private inference requires a significant increase of the privacy budget, which on the other hand comes with a substantial loss in statistical accuracy.
  A potential solution to reconcile the conflicting goals of statistical accuracy and privacy is to analyze the data under parametric model assumptions and in the last decade, several parametric bootstrap methods for inference under privacy have been investigated. However, uncertainty quantification by parametric bootstrap is only valid if the the quantities of interest can be identified as the parameters of a statistical model and the imposed model assumptions are (at least approximately) satisfied. An alternative to parametric methods is the empirical bootstrap that is a widely used tool for non-parametric inference and well studied in the non-private regime. However, under privacy, less insight is available. In this paper, we propose a private empirical $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap and validate its consistency and privacy guarantees under Gaussian Differential Privacy. Compared to the the private $n$ out of $n$ bootstrap, our approach has several advantages. First, it comes with less computational costs, in particular for massive data. Second, the proposed procedure needs less additional noise in the bootstrap iterations, which leads to an improved statistical accuracy while asymptotically guaranteeing the same level of privacy. Third, we demonstrate much better finite sample properties compared to the currently available procedures.

Abstract: While research on applications and evaluations of explanation methods continues to expand, fairness of the explanation methods concerning disparities in their performance across subgroups remains an often overlooked aspect. In this paper, we address this gap by showing that, across three tasks and five language models, widely used post-hoc feature attribution methods exhibit significant gender disparity with respect to their faithfulness, robustness, and complexity. These disparities persist even when the models are pre-trained or fine-tuned on particularly unbiased datasets, indicating that the disparities we observe are not merely consequences of biased training data. Our results highlight the importance of addressing disparities in explanations when developing and applying explainability methods, as these can lead to biased outcomes against certain subgroups, with particularly critical implications in high-stakes contexts. Furthermore, our findings underscore the importance of incorporating the fairness of explanations, alongside overall model fairness and explainability, as a requirement in regulatory frameworks.

Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) models continue to evolve and become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their interpretability remains a critical challenge. Given the growing variety of explainability methods and diverse stakeholder requirements, frameworks that help stakeholders select appropriate explanations tailored to their specific use cases are increasingly important. To address this need, we introduce EvalxNLP, a Python framework for benchmarking state-of-the-art feature attribution methods for transformer-based NLP models. EvalxNLP integrates eight widely recognized explainability techniques from the Explainable AI (XAI) literature, enabling users to generate and evaluate explanations based on key properties such as faithfulness, plausibility, and complexity. Our framework also provides interactive, LLM-based textual explanations, facilitating user understanding of the generated explanations and evaluation outcomes. Human evaluation results indicate high user satisfaction with EvalxNLP, suggesting it is a promising framework for benchmarking explanation methods across diverse user groups. By offering a user-friendly and extensible platform, EvalxNLP aims at democratizing explainability tools and supporting the systematic comparison and advancement of XAI techniques in NLP.

Abstract: Humans (and many vertebrates) face the problem of fusing together multiple fixations of a scene in order to obtain a representation of the whole, where each fixation uses a high-resolution fovea and decreasing resolution in the periphery. In this paper we explicitly represent the retinal transformation of a fixation as a linear downsampling of a high-resolution latent image of the scene, exploiting the known geometry. This linear transformation allows us to carry out exact inference for the latent variables in factor analysis (FA) and mixtures of FA models of the scene. Further, this allows us to formulate and solve the choice of "where to look next" as a Bayesian experimental design problem using the Expected Information Gain criterion. Experiments on the Frey faces and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our models.

Abstract: Online multi-object tracking has been recently dominated by tracking-by-detection (TbD) methods, where recent advances rely on increasingly sophisticated heuristics for tracklet representation, feature fusion, and multi-stage matching. The key strength of TbD lies in its modular design, enabling the integration of specialized off-the-shelf models like motion predictors and re-identification. However, the extensive usage of human-crafted rules for temporal associations makes these methods inherently limited in their ability to capture the complex interplay between various tracking cues. In this work, we introduce CAMEL, a novel association module for Context-Aware Multi-Cue ExpLoitation, that learns resilient association strategies directly from data, breaking free from hand-crafted heuristics while maintaining TbD's valuable modularity. At its core, CAMEL employs two transformer-based modules and relies on a novel association-centric training scheme to effectively model the complex interactions between tracked targets and their various association cues. Unlike end-to-end detection-by-tracking approaches, our method remains lightweight and fast to train while being able to leverage external off-the-shelf models. Our proposed online tracking pipeline, CAMELTrack, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple tracking benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/TrackingLaboratory/CAMELTrack.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization has recently attracted significant attention in machine learning due to its wide range of applications and advanced hierarchical optimization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework, named PnPBO, for developing and analyzing stochastic bilevel optimization methods. This framework integrates both modern unbiased and biased stochastic estimators into the single-loop bilevel optimization framework introduced in [9], with several improvements. In the implementation of PnPBO, all stochastic estimators for different variables can be independently incorporated, and an additional moving average technique is applied when using an unbiased estimator for the upper-level variable. In the theoretical analysis, we provide a unified convergence and complexity analysis for PnPBO, demonstrating that the adaptation of various stochastic estimators (including PAGE, ZeroSARAH, and mixed strategies) within the PnPBO framework achieves optimal sample complexity, comparable to that of single-level optimization. This resolves the open question of whether the optimal complexity bounds for solving bilevel optimization are identical to those for single-level optimization. Finally, we empirically validate our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness on several benchmark problems and confirming our theoretical findings.

Abstract: The capabilities of additive manufacturing have facilitated the design and production of mechanical metamaterials with diverse unit cell geometries. Establishing linkages between the vast design space of unit cells and their effective mechanical properties is critical for the efficient design and performance evaluation of such metamaterials. However, physics-based simulations of metamaterial unit cells across the entire design space are computationally expensive, necessitating a materials informatics framework to efficiently capture complex structure-property relationships. In this work, principal component analysis of 2-point correlation functions is performed to extract the salient features from a large dataset of randomly generated 2D metamaterials. Physics-based simulations are performed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based homogenization approach to efficiently compute the homogenized effective elastic stiffness across the extensive unit cell designs. Subsequently, Gaussian process regression is used to generate reduced-order surrogates, mapping unit cell designs to their homogenized effective elastic constant. It is demonstrated that the adopted workflow enables a high-value low-dimensional representation of the voluminous stochastic metamaterial dataset, facilitating the construction of robust structure-property maps. Finally, an uncertainty-based active learning framework is utilized to train a surrogate model with a significantly smaller number of data points compared to the original full dataset. It is shown that a dataset as small as $0.61\%$ of the entire dataset is sufficient to generate accurate and robust structure-property maps.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation plays a key role in applications such as virtual avatars, gaming, and digital content creation. While existing methods have made significant progress in achieving accurate lip synchronization and generating basic emotional expressions, they often struggle to capture and effectively transfer nuanced performance styles. We propose a novel example-based generation framework that conditions a latent diffusion model on a reference style clip to produce highly expressive and temporally coherent facial animations. To address the challenge of accurately adhering to the style reference, we introduce a novel conditioning mechanism called style basis, which extracts key poses from the reference and additively guides the diffusion generation process to fit the style without compromising lip synchronization quality. This approach enables the model to capture subtle stylistic cues while ensuring that the generated animations align closely with the input speech. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and perceptual evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in faithfully reproducing the desired style while achieving superior lip synchronization across various speech scenarios.

Abstract: Dereverberation is an important sub-task of Speech Enhancement (SE) to improve the signal's intelligibility and quality. However, it remains challenging because the reverberation is highly correlated with the signal. Furthermore, the single-channel SE literature has predominantly focused on rooms with short reverb times (typically under 1 second), smaller rooms (under volumes of 1000 cubic meters) and relatively short distances (up to 2 meters). In this paper, we explore real-time low-latency single-channel SE under distant microphone scenarios, such as 5 to 10 meters, and focus on conference rooms and theatres, with larger room dimensions and reverberation times. Such a setup is useful for applications such as lecture demonstrations, drama, and to enhance stage acoustics. First, we show that single-channel SE in such challenging scenarios is feasible. Second, we investigate the relationship between room volume and reverberation time, and demonstrate its importance when randomly simulating room impulse responses. Lastly, we show that for dereverberation with short decay times, preserving early reflections before decaying the transfer function of the room improves overall signal quality.

Abstract: The efficient computation of parametric solution sensitivities is a key challenge in the integration of learning-enhanced methods with nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), as their availability is crucial for many learning algorithms. While approaches presented in the machine learning community are limited to convex or unconstrained formulations, this paper discusses the computation of solution sensitivities of general nonlinear programs (NLPs) using the implicit function theorem (IFT) and smoothed optimality conditions treated in interior-point methods (IPM). We detail sensitivity computation within a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method which employs an IPM for the quadratic subproblems. The publication is accompanied by an efficient open-source implementation within the framework, providing both forward and adjoint sensitivities for general optimal control problems, achieving speedups exceeding 3x over the state-of-the-art solver mpc.pytorch.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with guidance techniques playing a crucial role in enhancing sample quality. Despite their empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the guidance effect remains limited. Existing studies only focus on case studies, where the distribution conditioned on each class is either isotropic Gaussian or supported on a one-dimensional interval with some extra conditions. How to analyze the guidance effect beyond these case studies remains an open question. Towards closing this gap, we make an attempt to analyze diffusion guidance under general data distributions. Rather than demonstrating uniform sample quality improvement, which does not hold in some distributions, we prove that guidance can improve the whole sample quality, in the sense that the average reciprocal of the classifier probability decreases with the existence of guidance. This aligns with the motivation of introducing guidance.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of mapping polygonal buildings from remote sensing images and introduces a novel algorithm, the Global Collinearity-aware Polygonizer (GCP). GCP, built upon an instance segmentation framework, processes binary masks produced by any instance segmentation model. The algorithm begins by collecting polylines sampled along the contours of the binary masks. These polylines undergo a refinement process using a transformer-based regression module to ensure they accurately fit the contours of the targeted building instances. Subsequently, a collinearity-aware polygon simplification module simplifies these refined polylines and generate the final polygon representation. This module employs dynamic programming technique to optimize an objective function that balances the simplicity and fidelity of the polygons, achieving globally optimal solutions. Furthermore, the optimized collinearity-aware objective is seamlessly integrated into network training, enhancing the cohesiveness of the entire pipeline. The effectiveness of GCP has been validated on two public benchmarks for polygonal building mapping. Further experiments reveal that applying the collinearity-aware polygon simplification module to arbitrary polylines, without prior knowledge, enhances accuracy over traditional methods such as the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. This finding underscores the broad applicability of GCP. The code for the proposed method will be made available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach combining Multimodal Deep Learning with intrinsic eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to predict pathological response in non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Due to the limitations of existing radiomics and unimodal deep learning approaches, we introduce an intermediate fusion strategy that integrates imaging and clinical data, enabling efficient interaction between data modalities. The proposed Multimodal Doctor-in-the-Loop method further enhances clinical relevance by embedding clinicians' domain knowledge directly into the training process, guiding the model's focus gradually from broader lung regions to specific lesions. Results demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and explainability, providing insights into optimal data integration strategies for clinical applications.

Abstract: Self-improvement requires robotic systems to initially learn from human-provided data and then gradually enhance their capabilities through interaction with the environment. This is similar to how humans improve their skills through continuous practice. However, achieving effective self-improvement is challenging, primarily because robots tend to repeat their existing abilities during interactions, often failing to generate new, valuable data for learning. In this paper, we identify the key to successful self-improvement: modal-level exploration and data selection. By incorporating a modal-level exploration mechanism during policy execution, the robot can produce more diverse and multi-modal interactions. At the same time, we select the most valuable trials and high-quality segments from these interactions for learning. We successfully demonstrate effective robot self-improvement on both simulation benchmarks and real-world experiments. The capability for self-improvement will enable us to develop more robust and high-success-rate robotic control strategies at a lower cost.

<title>VIDSTAMP: A Temporally-Aware Watermark for Ownership and Integrity in Video Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The rapid rise of video diffusion models has enabled the generation of highly realistic and temporally coherent videos, raising critical concerns about content authenticity, provenance, and misuse. Existing watermarking approaches, whether passive, post-hoc, or adapted from image-based techniques, often struggle to withstand video-specific manipulations such as frame insertion, dropping, or reordering, and typically degrade visual quality. In this work, we introduce VIDSTAMP, a watermarking framework that embeds per-frame or per-segment messages directly into the latent space of temporally-aware video diffusion models. By fine-tuning the model's decoder through a two-stage pipeline, first on static image datasets to promote spatial message separation, and then on synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency, VIDSTAMP learns to embed high-capacity, flexible watermarks with minimal perceptual impact. Leveraging architectural components such as 3D convolutions and temporal attention, our method imposes no additional inference cost and offers better perceptual quality than prior methods, while maintaining comparable robustness against common distortions and tampering. VIDSTAMP embeds 768 bits per video (48 bits per frame) with a bit accuracy of 95.0%, achieves a log P-value of -166.65 (lower is better), and maintains a video quality score of 0.836, comparable to unwatermarked outputs (0.838) and surpassing prior methods in capacity-quality tradeoffs.

<title>Negative Stepsizes Make Gradient-Descent-Ascent Converge</title>

Abstract: Efficient computation of min-max problems is a central question in optimization, learning, games, and controls. Arguably the most natural algorithm is gradient-descent-ascent (GDA). However, since the 1970s, conventional wisdom has argued that GDA fails to converge even on simple problems. This failure spurred an extensive literature on modifying GDA with additional building blocks such as extragradients, optimism, momentum, anchoring, etc. In contrast, we show that GDA converges in its original form by simply using a judicious choice of stepsizes.
  The key innovation is the proposal of unconventional stepsize schedules (dubbed slingshot stepsize schedules) that are time-varying, asymmetric, and periodically negative. We show that all three properties are necessary for convergence, and that altogether this enables GDA to converge on the classical counterexamples (e.g., unconstrained convex-concave problems). All of our results apply to the last iterate of GDA, as is typically desired in practice.
  The core algorithmic intuition is that although negative stepsizes make backward progress, they de-synchronize the min and max variables (overcoming the cycling issue of GDA), and lead to a slingshot phenomenon in which the forward progress in the other iterations is overwhelmingly larger. This results in fast overall convergence. Geometrically, the slingshot dynamics leverage the non-reversibility of gradient flow: positive/negative steps cancel to first order, yielding a second-order net movement in a new direction that leads to convergence and is otherwise impossible for GDA to move in. We interpret this as a second-order finite-differencing algorithm and show that, intriguingly, it approximately implements consensus optimization, an empirically popular algorithm for min-max problems involving deep neural networks (e.g., training GANs).

Abstract: Human motion modeling traditionally separates motion generation and estimation into distinct tasks with specialized models. Motion generation models focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text, audio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate motion trajectories from observations like videos. Despite sharing underlying representations of temporal dynamics and kinematics, this separation limits knowledge transfer between tasks and requires maintaining separate models. We present GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion estimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to reformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the output motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging the synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global motion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce an estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with 2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity. Furthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed multimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals, offering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits: generative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like occlusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate GENMO's effectiveness as a generalist framework that successfully handles multiple human motion tasks within a single model.

Abstract: We consider the problem of sequentially learning to estimate, in the mean squared error (MSE) sense, a Gaussian $K$-vector of unknown covariance by observing only $m < K$ of its entries in each round. We propose two MSE estimators, and analyze their concentration properties. The first estimator is non-adaptive, as it is tied to a predetermined $m$-subset and lacks the flexibility to transition to alternative subsets. The second estimator, which is derived using a regression framework, is adaptive and exhibits better concentration bounds in comparison to the first estimator. We frame the MSE estimation problem with bandit feedback, where the objective is to find the MSE-optimal subset with high confidence. We propose a variant of the successive elimination algorithm to solve this problem. We also derive a minimax lower bound to understand the fundamental limit on the sample complexity of this problem.

Abstract: Smart traffic lights in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are envisioned to greatly increase traffic efficiency and reduce congestion. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to adaptively control traffic lights based on the real-time traffic situation in a road network. However, conventional methods may suffer from poor scalability. In this paper, we investigate deep reinforcement learning to control traffic lights, and both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the intelligent behavior ``greenwave" (i.e., a vehicle will see a progressive cascade of green lights, and not have to brake at any intersection) emerges naturally a grid road network, which is proved to be the optimal policy in an avenue with multiple cross streets. As a first step, we use two DRL algorithms for the traffic light control problems in two scenarios. In a single road intersection, we verify that the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm delivers a thresholding policy; and in a grid road network, we adopt the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Secondly, numerical experiments show that the DQN algorithm delivers the optimal control, and the DDPG algorithm with passive observations has the capability to produce on its own a high-level intelligent behavior in a grid road network, namely, the ``greenwave" policy emerges. We also verify the ``greenwave" patterns in a $5 \times 10$ grid road network. Thirdly, the ``greenwave" patterns demonstrate that DRL algorithms produce favorable solutions since the ``greenwave" policy shown in experiment results is proved to be optimal in a specified traffic model (an avenue with multiple cross streets). The delivered policies both in a single road intersection and a grid road network demonstrate the scalability of DRL algorithms.

Abstract: We study the complexity of optimizing nonsmooth nonconvex Lipschitz functions by producing $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. Several recent works have presented randomized algorithms that produce such points using $\tilde O(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ first-order oracle calls, independent of the dimension $d$. It has been an open problem as to whether a similar result can be obtained via a deterministic algorithm. We resolve this open problem, showing that randomization is necessary to obtain a dimension-free rate. In particular, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(d)$ for any deterministic algorithm. Moreover, we show that unlike smooth or convex optimization, access to function values is required for any deterministic algorithm to halt within any finite time.
  On the other hand, we prove that if the function is even slightly smooth, then the dimension-free rate of $\tilde O(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ can be obtained by a deterministic algorithm with merely a logarithmic dependence on the smoothness parameter. Motivated by these findings, we turn to study the complexity of deterministically smoothing Lipschitz functions. Though there are efficient black-box randomized smoothings, we start by showing that no such deterministic procedure can smooth functions in a meaningful manner, resolving an open question. We then bypass this impossibility result for the structured case of ReLU neural networks. To that end, in a practical white-box setting in which the optimizer is granted access to the network's architecture, we propose a simple, dimension-free, deterministic smoothing that provably preserves $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. Our method applies to a variety of architectures of arbitrary depth, including ResNets and ConvNets. Combined with our algorithm, this yields the first deterministic dimension-free algorithm for optimizing ReLU networks, circumventing our lower bound.

Abstract: We introduce an adaptive method with formal quality guarantees for weak supervision in a non-stationary setting. Our goal is to infer the unknown labels of a sequence of data by using weak supervision sources that provide independent noisy signals of the correct classification for each data point. This setting includes crowdsourcing and programmatic weak supervision. We focus on the non-stationary case, where the accuracy of the weak supervision sources can drift over time, e.g., because of changes in the underlying data distribution. Due to the drift, older data could provide misleading information to infer the label of the current data point. Previous work relied on a priori assumptions on the magnitude of the drift to decide how much data to use from the past. In contrast, our algorithm does not require any assumptions on the drift, and it adapts based on the input by dynamically varying its window size. In particular, at each step, our algorithm estimates the current accuracies of the weak supervision sources by identifying a window of past observations that guarantees a near-optimal minimization of the trade-off between the error due to the variance of the estimation and the error due to the drift. Experiments on synthetic and real-world labelers show that our approach adapts to the drift.

Abstract: Recent advances in the literature show promising potential of deep learning methods, particularly neural operators, in obtaining numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) beyond the reach of current numerical solvers. However, existing data-driven approaches often rely on training data produced by numerical PDE solvers (e.g., finite difference or finite element methods). We introduce a "backward" data generation method that avoids solving the PDE numerically: by randomly sampling candidate solutions $u_j$ from the appropriate solution space (e.g., $H_0^1(\Omega)$), we compute the corresponding right-hand side $f_j$ directly from the equation by differentiation. This produces training pairs ${(f_j, u_j)}$ by computing derivatives rather than solving a PDE numerically for each data point, enabling fast, large-scale data generation consisting of exact solutions. Experiments indicate that models trained on this synthetic data generalize well when tested on data produced by standard solvers. While the idea is simple, we hope this method will expand the potential of neural PDE solvers that do not rely on classical numerical solvers to generate their data.

Abstract: Continual learning is crucial for applying machine learning in challenging, dynamic, and often resource-constrained environments. However, catastrophic forgetting - overwriting previously learned knowledge when new information is acquired - remains a major challenge. In this work, we examine the intermediate representations in neural network layers during continual learning and find that such representations are less prone to forgetting, highlighting their potential to accelerate computation. Motivated by these findings, we propose to use auxiliary classifiers(ACs) to enhance performance and demonstrate that integrating ACs into various continual learning methods consistently improves accuracy across diverse evaluation settings, yielding an average 10% relative gain. We also leverage the ACs to reduce the average cost of the inference by 10-60% without compromising accuracy, enabling the model to return the predictions before computing all the layers. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning.

Abstract: Many variants of Optimal Transport (OT) have been developed to address its heavy computation. Among them, notably, Sliced Wasserstein (SW) is widely used for application domains by projecting the OT problem onto one-dimensional lines, and leveraging the closed-form expression of the univariate OT to reduce the computational burden. However, projecting measures onto low-dimensional spaces can lead to a loss of topological information. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we propose to replace one-dimensional lines with a more intricate structure, called tree systems. This structure is metrizable by a tree metric, which yields a closed-form expression for OT problems on tree systems. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to formally define tree systems with their topological properties, introduce the concept of splitting maps, which operate as the projection mechanism onto these structures, then finally propose a novel variant of Radon transform for tree systems and verify its injectivity. This framework leads to an efficient metric between measures, termed Tree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on Systems of Lines (TSW-SL). By conducting a variety of experiments on gradient flows, image style transfer, and generative models, we illustrate that our proposed approach performs favorably compared to SW and its variants.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.

Abstract: Modern privacy regulations have spurred the evolution of machine unlearning, a technique that enables the removal of data from an already trained ML model without requiring retraining from scratch. Previous unlearning methods tend to induce the model to achieve lowest classification accuracy on the removal data. Nonetheless, the authentic objective of machine unlearning is to align the unlearned model with the gold model, i.e., achieving the same classification accuracy as the gold model. For this purpose, we present a Twin Machine Unlearning (TMU) approach, where a twin unlearning problem is defined corresponding to the original unlearning problem. As a results, the generalization-label predictor trained on the twin problem can be transferred to the original problem, facilitating aligned data removal. Comprehensive empirical experiments illustrate that our approach significantly enhances the alignment between the unlearned model and the gold model. Meanwhile, our method allows data removal without compromising the model accuracy.

Abstract: This paper studies asynchronous stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms and their theoretical application to reinforcement learning in semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs) with an average-reward criterion. We first extend Borkar and Meyn's stability proof method to accommodate more general noise conditions, yielding broader convergence guarantees for asynchronous SA. To sharpen the convergence analysis, we further examine shadowing properties in the asynchronous setting, building on a dynamical-systems approach of Hirsch and Bena\"{i}m. Leveraging these SA results, we establish the convergence of an asynchronous SA analogue of Schweitzer's classical relative value iteration algorithm, RVI Q-learning, for finite-space, weakly communicating SMDPs. Moreover, to make full use of these SA results in this application, we introduce new monotonicity conditions for estimating the optimal reward rate in RVI Q-learning. These conditions substantially expand the previously considered algorithmic framework, and we address them with novel arguments in the stability and convergence analysis of RVI Q-learning.

Abstract: The inherent uncertainty in the environmental transition model of Reinforcement Learning (RL) necessitates a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation. This balance is crucial for optimizing computational resources to accurately estimate expected rewards for the agent. In scenarios with sparse rewards, such as robotic control systems, achieving this balance is particularly challenging. However, given that many environments possess extensive prior knowledge, learning from the ground up in such contexts may be redundant. To address this issue, we propose Language Model Guided reward Tuning (LMGT), a novel, sample-efficient framework. LMGT leverages the comprehensive prior knowledge embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their proficiency in processing non-standard data forms, such as wiki tutorials. By utilizing LLM-guided reward shifts, LMGT adeptly balances exploration and exploitation, thereby guiding the agent's exploratory behavior and enhancing sample efficiency. We have rigorously evaluated LMGT across various RL tasks and evaluated it in the embodied robotic environment Housekeep. Our results demonstrate that LMGT consistently outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, the findings suggest that our framework can substantially reduce the computational resources required during the RL training phase.

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to identify a design that maximizes a black-box function using only a fixed, pre-collected dataset of designs and their corresponding scores. A common approach in offline MBO is to train a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) and then find the best design within this surrogate model by different optimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk of out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically overestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions. Prior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using regularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models trained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO, which is to select promising designs rather than to predict their scores precisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate designs based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best designs even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct experiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final designs and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast, a metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger correlation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based model that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising designs based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error on ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based models than twenty existing methods.

Abstract: Pretrained foundation models have exhibited extraordinary in-context learning performance, allowing zero-shot generalization to new tasks not encountered during pretraining. In the case of reinforcement learning (RL), in-context RL (ICRL) emerges when pretraining FMs on decision-making problems in an autoregressive-supervised manner. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art ICRL algorithms, like Algorithm Distillation, Decision Pretrained Transformer and Decision Importance Transformer, impose stringent requirements on the pretraining dataset concerning the source policies, context information, and action labels. Notably, these algorithms either demand optimal policies or require varying degrees of well-trained behavior policies for all pretraining environments. This significantly hinders the application of ICRL to real-world scenarios, where acquiring optimal or well-trained policies for a substantial volume of real-world training environments can be intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, termed State-Action Distillation (SAD), that allows to generate an effective pretraining dataset guided solely by random policies. In particular, SAD selects query states and corresponding action labels by distilling outstanding state-action pairs from the entire state and action spaces by using random policies within a trust horizon, and then inherits the classical autoregressive-supervised mechanism during pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables effective ICRL under random policies and random contexts. We also establish quantitative analysis of the trustworthiness as well as the performance guarantees of SAD. Moreover, our empirical results across multiple popular ICRL benchmark environments demonstrate that, on average, SAD outperforms the best baseline by 236.3% in the offline evaluation and by 135.2% in the online evaluation.

Abstract: Despite their tremendous success and versatility, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from inference inefficiency and rely on advanced computational infrastructure. To address these challenges and make these models more accessible and cost-effective, in this paper, we propose algorithms to improve the inference time and memory efficiency of DNNs with binary and ternary weight matrices. Particularly focusing on matrix multiplication as the bottleneck operation of inference, we observe that, once trained, the weight matrices of a model no longer change. This allows us to preprocess these matrices and create indices that help reduce the storage requirements by a logarithmic factor while enabling our efficient inference algorithms. Specifically, for a $n\times n$ weight matrix, our efficient algorithm guarantees a time complexity of $O(\frac{n^2}{\log n})$, a logarithmic factor improvement over the standard vector-matrix multiplication. Besides theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the practical efficiency of our algorithms. Our results confirm the superiority of our approach both with respect to time and memory, as we observed a reduction in the multiplication time up to 29x and memory usage up to 6x. When applied to LLMs, our experiments show up to a 5.24x speedup in the inference time.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) is increasingly employed in privacy-preserving machine learning to protect user data before sharing it with an untrusted aggregator. Most LDP methods assume that users possess only a single data record, which is a significant limitation since users often gather extensive datasets (e.g., images, text, time-series data) and frequently have access to public datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a locally private sampling framework that leverages both the private and public datasets of each user. Specifically, we assume each user has two distributions: $p$ and $q$ that represent their private dataset and the public dataset, respectively. The objective is to design a mechanism that generates a private sample approximating $p$ while simultaneously preserving $q$. We frame this objective as a minimax optimization problem using $f$-divergence as the utility measure. We fully characterize the minimax optimal mechanisms for general $f$-divergences provided that $p$ and $q$ are discrete distributions. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this optimal mechanism is universal across all $f$-divergences. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our minimax optimal sampler compared to the state-of-the-art locally private sampler.

<title>Competition Dynamics Shape Algorithmic Phases of In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competition dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.

Abstract: We present DriveGPT, a scalable behavior model for autonomous driving. We model driving as a sequential decision-making task, and learn a transformer model to predict future agent states as tokens in an autoregressive fashion. We scale up our model parameters and training data by multiple orders of magnitude, enabling us to explore the scaling properties in terms of dataset size, model parameters, and compute. We evaluate DriveGPT across different scales in a planning task, through both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, including closed-loop driving in complex real-world scenarios. In a separate prediction task, DriveGPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits improved performance by pretraining on a large-scale dataset, further validating the benefits of data scaling.

Abstract: Surrogate models are frequently employed as efficient substitutes for the costly execution of real-world processes. However, constructing a high-quality surrogate model often demands extensive data acquisition. A solution to this issue is to transfer pre-trained surrogate models for new tasks, provided that certain invariances exist between tasks. This study focuses on transferring non-differentiable surrogate models (e.g., random forests) from a source function to a target function, where we assume their domains are related by an unknown affine transformation, using only a limited amount of transfer data points evaluated on the target. Previous research attempts to tackle this challenge for differentiable models, e.g., Gaussian process regression, which minimizes the empirical loss on the transfer data by tuning the affine transformations. In this paper, we extend the previous work to the random forest and assess its effectiveness on a widely-used artificial problem set - Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) testbed, and on four real-world transfer learning problems. The results highlight the significant practical advantages of the proposed method, particularly in reducing both the data requirements and computational costs of training surrogate models for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we present a mesh-independent, data-driven library, chebgreen, to mathematically model one-dimensional systems, possessing an associated control parameter, and whose governing partial differential equation is unknown. The proposed method learns an Empirical Green's Function for the associated, but hidden, boundary value problem, in the form of a Rational Neural Network from which we subsequently construct a bivariate representation in a Chebyshev basis. We uncover the Green's function, at an unseen control parameter value, by interpolating the left and right singular functions within a suitable library, expressed as points on a manifold of Quasimatrices, while the associated singular values are interpolated with Lagrange polynomials.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a decentralized paradigm to train models while preserving privacy. However, conventional FL struggles with data heterogeneity and class imbalance, which degrade model performance. Clustered FL balances personalization and decentralized training by grouping clients with analogous data distributions, enabling improved accuracy while adhering to privacy constraints. This approach effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heterogeneity in FL. In this work, we propose a novel clustered FL method, FedGWC (Federated Gaussian Weighting Clustering), which groups clients based on their data distribution, allowing training of a more robust and personalized model on the identified clusters. FedGWC identifies homogeneous clusters by transforming individual empirical losses to model client interactions with a Gaussian reward mechanism. Additionally, we introduce the Wasserstein Adjusted Score, a new clustering metric for FL to evaluate cluster cohesion with respect to the individual class distribution. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show that FedGWC outperforms existing FL algorithms in cluster quality and classification accuracy, validating the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical constraints into deep learning models. However, standard PINNs often require a large number of training samples to achieve high accuracy, leading to increased computational costs. To address this issue, we propose Active Learning-Driven PINNs (AL-PINN), which integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Active Learning (AL) strategies to optimize sample selection dynamically.
  AL-PINN utilizes Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate epistemic uncertainty in the model predictions, enabling the adaptive selection of high-uncertainty regions for additional training. This approach significantly enhances learning efficiency by focusing computational resources on the most informative data points. We evaluate AL-PINN on benchmark PDE problems with known analytical solutions and real-world WeatherBench climate data. Our results demonstrate that AL-PINN achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to traditional PINNs while reducing the number of required training samples.
  The proposed framework is particularly beneficial for scientific and engineering applications where data collection is expensive or limited, such as climate modeling, medical simulations, and material science. Our findings highlight the potential of active learning in accelerating PINN-based PDE solvers while maintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws into neural network training. However, traditional PINN models are typically designed for single PDEs, limiting their generalizability across different physical systems. In this work, we explore the potential of a foundation PINN model capable of solving multiple PDEs within a unified architecture. We investigate the efficacy of a single PINN framework trained on four distinct PDEs-the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO), the 1D Heat Equation, the 1D Wave Equation, and the 2D Laplace Equation, demonstrating its ability to learn diverse physical dynamics.
  To enhance sample efficiency, we incorporate Active Learning (AL) using Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout-based uncertainty estimation, selecting the most informative training samples iteratively. We evaluate different active learning strategies, comparing models trained on 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the full dataset, and analyze their impact on solution accuracy. Our results indicate that targeted uncertainty sampling significantly improves performance with fewer training samples, leading to efficient learning across multiple PDEs.
  This work highlights the feasibility of a generalizable PINN-based foundation model, capable of adapting to different physics-based problems without redesigning network architectures. Our findings suggest that multi-PDE PINNs with active learning can serve as an effective approach for reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy in physics-based deep learning applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants like Lean. However, current state of the art language models struggles to predict next step in proofs leading practitioners to use different sampling techniques to improve LLMs capabilities. We observe that the LLM is capable of predicting the correct tactic; however, it faces challenges in ranking it appropriately within the set of candidate tactics, affecting the overall selection process. To overcome this hurdle, we use activation steering to guide LLMs responses to improve the generations at the time of inference. Our results suggest that activation steering offers a promising lightweight alternative to specialized fine-tuning for enhancing theorem proving capabilities in LLMs, particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In combinatorial semi-bandits, a learner repeatedly selects from a combinatorial decision set of arms, receives the realized sum of rewards, and observes the rewards of the individual selected arms as feedback. In this paper, we extend this framework to include \emph{graph feedback}, where the learner observes the rewards of all neighboring arms of the selected arms in a feedback graph $G$. We establish that the optimal regret over a time horizon $T$ scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(S\sqrt{T}+\sqrt{\alpha ST})$, where $S$ is the size of the combinatorial decisions and $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$. This result interpolates between the known regrets $\widetilde\Theta(S\sqrt{T})$ under full information (i.e., $G$ is complete) and $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{KST})$ under the semi-bandit feedback (i.e., $G$ has only self-loops), where $K$ is the total number of arms. A key technical ingredient is to realize a convexified action using a random decision vector with negative correlations. We also show that online stochastic mirror descent (OSMD) that only realizes convexified actions in expectation is suboptimal.

Abstract: Dynamic emotion recognition in the wild remains challenging due to the transient nature of emotional expressions and temporal misalignment of multi-modal cues. Traditional approaches predict valence and arousal and often overlook the inherent correlation between these two dimensions. The proposed Multi-modal Attention for Valence-Arousal Emotion Network (MAVEN) integrates visual, audio, and textual modalities through a bi-directional cross-modal attention mechanism. MAVEN uses modality-specific encoders to extract features from synchronized video frames, audio segments, and transcripts, predicting emotions in polar coordinates following Russell's circumplex model. The evaluation of the Aff-Wild2 dataset using MAVEN achieved a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.3061, surpassing the ResNet-50 baseline model with a CCC of 0.22. The multistage architecture captures the subtle and transient nature of emotional expressions in conversational videos and improves emotion recognition in real-world situations.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection holds notable importance for risk identification and fault detection across diverse application domains. Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/DConAD.

Abstract: This paper presents an automated one-shot bird call classification pipeline designed for rare species absent from large publicly available classifiers like BirdNET and Perch. While these models excel at detecting common birds with abundant training data, they lack options for species with only 1-3 known recordings-a critical limitation for conservationists monitoring the last remaining individuals of endangered birds. To address this, we leverage the embedding space of large bird classification networks and develop a classifier using cosine similarity, combined with filtering and denoising preprocessing techniques, to optimize detection with minimal training data. We evaluate various embedding spaces using clustering metrics and validate our approach in both a simulated scenario with Xeno-Canto recordings and a real-world test on the critically endangered tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris), which has no existing classifiers and only three confirmed recordings. The final model achieved 1.0 recall and 0.95 accuracy in detecting tooth-billed pigeon calls, making it practical for use in the field. This open-source system provides a practical tool for conservationists seeking to detect and monitor rare species on the brink of extinction.

Specifically, our approach extends the (subspace constrained) mean shift algorithm to such product spaces, addressing potential challenges in the generalization process. We establish the algorithmic convergence of the proposed methods, along with practical implementation guidelines.

Abstract: The proximal stochastic gradient method (PSGD) is one of the state-of-the-art approaches for stochastic composite-type problems. In contrast to its deterministic counterpart, PSGD has been found to have difficulties with the correct identification of underlying substructures (such as supports, low rank patterns, or active constraints) and it does not possess a finite-time manifold identification property. Existing solutions rely on convexity assumptions or on the additional usage of variance reduction techniques. In this paper, we address these limitations and present a simple variant of PSGD based on Robinson's normal map. The proposed normal map-based proximal stochastic gradient method (NSGD) is shown to converge globally, i.e., accumulation points of the generated iterates correspond to stationary points almost surely. In addition, we establish complexity bounds for NSGD that match the known results for PSGD and we prove that NSGD can almost surely identify active manifolds in finite-time in a general nonconvex setting. Our derivations are built on almost sure iterate convergence guarantees and utilize analysis techniques based on the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality.

Abstract: Graphical models have exhibited their performance in numerous tasks ranging from biological analysis to recommender systems. However, graphical models with hub nodes are computationally difficult to fit, particularly when the dimension of the data is large. To efficiently estimate the hub graphical models, we introduce a two-phase algorithm. The proposed algorithm first generates a good initial point via a dual alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and then warm starts a semismooth Newton (SSN) based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to compute a solution that is accurate enough for practical tasks. We fully excavate the sparsity structure of the generalized Jacobian arising from the hubs in the graphical models, which ensures that the algorithm can obtain a nice solution very efficiently. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic data and real data show that it obviously outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, in some high dimensional tasks, it can save more than 70\% of the execution time, meanwhile still achieves a high-quality estimation.

Abstract: Recent developments in domains such as non-local games, quantum interactive proofs, and quantum generative adversarial networks have renewed interest in quantum game theory and, specifically, quantum zero-sum games. Central to classical game theory is the efficient algorithmic computation of Nash equilibria, which represent optimal strategies for both players. In 2008, Jain and Watrous proposed the first classical algorithm for computing equilibria in quantum zero-sum games using the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Updates (MMWU) method to achieve a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon^2)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in the $4^d$-dimensional spectraplex. In this work, we propose a hierarchy of quantum optimization algorithms that generalize MMWU via an extra-gradient mechanism. Notably, within this proposed hierarchy, we introduce the Optimistic Matrix Multiplicative Weights Update (OMMWU) algorithm and establish its average-iterate convergence complexity as $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. This quadratic speed-up relative to Jain and Watrous' original algorithm sets a new benchmark for computing $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in quantum zero-sum games.

Abstract: Multivariate density estimation is of great interest in various scientific and engineering disciplines. In this work, we introduce a new framework called Variance-Reduced Sketching (VRS), specifically designed to estimate multivariate density functions with a reduced curse of dimensionality. Our VRS framework conceptualizes multivariate functions as infinite-size matrices/tensors, and facilitates a new sketching technique motivated by the numerical linear algebra literature to reduce the variance in density estimation problems. We demonstrate the robust numerical performance of VRS through a series of simulated experiments and real-world data applications. Notably, VRS shows remarkable improvement over existing neural network density estimators and classical kernel methods in numerous distribution models. Additionally, we offer theoretical justifications for VRS to support its ability to deliver density estimation with a reduced curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: Financial cluster analysis allows investors to discover investment alternatives and avoid undertaking excessive risks. However, this analytical task faces substantial challenges arising from many pairwise comparisons, the dynamic correlations across time spans, and the ambiguity in deriving implications from business relational knowledge. We propose Prismatic, a visual analytics system that integrates quantitative analysis of historical performance and qualitative analysis of business relational knowledge to cluster correlated businesses interactively. Prismatic features three clustering processes: dynamic cluster generation, knowledge-based cluster exploration, and correlation-based cluster validation. Utilizing a multi-view clustering approach, it enriches data-driven clusters with knowledge-driven similarity, providing a nuanced understanding of business correlations. Through well-coordinated visual views, Prismatic facilitates a comprehensive interpretation of intertwined quantitative and qualitative features, demonstrating its usefulness and effectiveness via case studies on formulating concept stocks and extensive interviews with domain experts.

Abstract: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) is essential for task adaptation, yet serving stacks today isolate inference and finetuning on separate GPU clusters -- wasting resources and under-utilizing hardware. We introduce FlexLLM, the first system to co-serve LLM inference and PEFT-based finetuning on shared GPUs by fusing computation at the token level. The static compilation optimizations in FlexLLM -- dependent parallelization and graph pruning significantly shrink activation memory, leading to end-to-end GPU memory savings by up to 80%. At runtime, a novel token-level finetuning mechanism paired with a hybrid token scheduler dynamically interleaves inference and training tokens within each co-serving iteration, meeting strict latency SLOs while maximizing utilization. In end-to-end benchmarks on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and Qwen-2.5-32B, FlexLLM sustains the inference SLO requirements up to 20 req/s, and improves finetuning throughput by 1.9-4.8x under heavy inference workloads and 2.5-6.8x under light loads, preserving over 76% of peak finetuning progress even at peak demand. The source code of FlexLLM is publicly available at https://github.com/flexflow/FlexFlow/.

Abstract: Holography stands at the forefront of visual technology, offering immersive, three-dimensional visualizations through the manipulation of light wave amplitude and phase. Although generative models have been extensively explored in the image domain, their application to holograms remains relatively underexplored due to the inherent complexity of phase learning. Exploiting generative models for holograms offers exciting opportunities for advancing innovation and creativity, such as semantic-aware hologram generation and editing. Currently, the most viable approach for utilizing generative models in the hologram domain involves integrating an image-based generative model with an image-to-hologram conversion model, which comes at the cost of increased computational complexity and inefficiency. To tackle this problem, we introduce P-Hologen, the first end-to-end generative framework designed for phase-only holograms (POHs). P-Hologen employs vector quantized variational autoencoders to capture the complex distributions of POHs. It also integrates the angular spectrum method into the training process, constructing latent spaces for complex phase data using strategies from the image processing domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that P-Hologen achieves superior quality and computational efficiency compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, our model generates high-quality unseen, diverse holographic content from its learned latent space without requiring pre-existing images. Our work paves the way for new applications and methodologies in holographic content creation, opening a new era in the exploration of generative holographic content. The code for our paper is publicly available on https://github.com/james0223/P-Hologen.

Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE.

Abstract: Buildings account for 40% of global energy consumption. A considerable portion of building energy consumption stems from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and thus implementing smart, energy-efficient HVAC systems has the potential to significantly impact the course of climate change. In recent years, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been increasingly assessed for this purpose due to their ability to learn and adapt purely from experience. They have been shown to outperform classical controllers in terms of energy cost and consumption, as well as thermal comfort. However, their weakness lies in their relatively poor data efficiency, requiring long periods of training to reach acceptable policies, making them inapplicable to real-world controllers directly. In this paper, we demonstrate that using federated learning to train the reinforcement learning controller of HVAC systems can improve the learning speed, as well as improve their ability to generalize, which in turn facilitates transfer learning to unseen building environments. In our setting, a global control policy is learned by aggregating local policies trained on multiple data centers located in different climate zones. The goal of the policy is to minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. We perform experiments evaluating three different optimizers for local policy training, as well as three different federated learning algorithms against two alternative baselines. Our experiments show that these effects lead to a faster learning speed, as well as greater generalization capabilities in the federated policy compared to any individually trained policy. Furthermore, the learning stability is significantly improved, with the learning process and performance of the federated policy being less sensitive to the choice of parameters and the inherent randomness of reinforcement learning.

<title>Towards One Model for Classical Dimensionality Reduction: A Probabilistic Perspective on UMAP and t-SNE</title>

arXiv:2405.17412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in Ravuri et al. (2023), that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate of the data precision matrix) using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.

Abstract: Introducing training-time augmentations is a key technique to enhance generalization and prepare deep neural networks against test-time corruptions. Inspired by the success of generative diffusion models, we propose a novel approach of coupling data mollification, in the form of image noising and blurring, with label smoothing to align predicted label confidences with image degradation. The method is simple to implement, introduces negligible overheads, and can be combined with existing augmentations. We demonstrate improved robustness and uncertainty quantification on the corrupted image benchmarks of CIFAR, TinyImageNet and ImageNet datasets.

<title>Quadratic Differentiable Optimization For The Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>

arXiv:2406.19532v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) addresses many important problems, including the challenging Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Alongside exact and heuristic solvers, differentiable approaches have emerged, often using continuous relaxations of ReLU-based or quadratic objectives. Noting that an MIS in a graph is a Maximum Clique (MC) in its complement, we propose a new quadratic formulation for MIS by incorporating an MC term, improving convergence and exploration. We show that every maximal independent set corresponds to a local minimizer, derive conditions with respect to the MIS size, and characterize stationary points. To tackle the non-convexity of the objective, we propose optimizing several initializations in parallel using momentum-based gradient descent, complemented by an efficient MIS checking criterion derived from our theory. We dub our method as **p**arallelized **C**lique-Informed **Q**uadratic **O**ptimization for MIS (**pCQO-MIS**). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to exact, heuristic, sampling, and data-centric approaches. Notably, our method avoids the out-of-distribution tuning and reliance on (un)labeled data required by data-centric methods, while achieving superior MIS sizes and competitive runtime relative to their inference time. Additionally, a key advantage of pCQO-MIS is that, unlike exact and heuristic solvers, the runtime scales only with the number of nodes in the graph, not the number of edges. Our code is available at the GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/ledenmat/pCQO-mis-benchmark/tree/refactor}{{{pCQO-MIS}}}

<title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>

arXiv:2409.07769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.

<title>Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems</title>

Abstract: Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.

arXiv:2410.01284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neal (1996) proved that infinitely wide shallow Bayesian neural networks (BNN) converge to Gaussian processes (GP), when the network weights have bounded prior variance. Cho & Saul (2009) provided a useful recursive formula for deep kernel processes for relating the covariance kernel of each layer to the layer immediately below. Moreover, they worked out the form of the layer-wise covariance kernel in an explicit manner for several common activation functions. Recent works, including Aitchison et al. (2021), have highlighted that the covariance kernels obtained in this manner are deterministic and hence, precludes any possibility of representation learning, which amounts to learning a non-degenerate posterior of a random kernel given the data. To address this, they propose adding artificial noise to the kernel to retain stochasticity, and develop deep kernel inverse Wishart processes. Nonetheless, this artificial noise injection could be critiqued in that it would not naturally emerge in a classic BNN architecture under an infinite-width limit. To address this, we show that a Bayesian deep neural network, where each layer width approaches infinity, and all network weights are elliptically distributed with infinite variance, converges to a process with $\alpha$-stable marginals in each layer that has a conditionally Gaussian representation. These conditional random covariance kernels could be recursively linked in the manner of Cho & Saul (2009), even though marginally the process exhibits stable behavior, and hence covariances are not even necessarily defined. We also provide useful generalizations of the recent results of Lor\'ia & Bhadra (2024) on shallow networks to multi-layer networks, and remedy the computational burden of their approach. The computational and statistical benefits over competing approaches stand out in simulations and in demonstrations on benchmark data sets.

Abstract: In the endeavor to make autonomous robots take actions, task planning is a major challenge that requires translating high-level task descriptions to long-horizon action sequences. Despite recent advances in language model agents, they remain prone to planning errors and limited in their ability to plan ahead. To address these limitations in robotic planning, we advocate a self-refining scheme that iteratively refines a draft plan until an equilibrium is reached. Remarkably, this process can be optimized end-to-end from an analytical perspective without the need to curate additional verifiers or reward models, allowing us to train self-refining planners in a simple supervised learning fashion. Meanwhile, a nested equilibrium sequence modeling procedure is devised for efficient closed-loop planning that incorporates useful feedback from the environment (or an internal world model). Our method is evaluated on the VirtualHome-Env benchmark, showing advanced performance with improved scaling w.r.t. inference-time computation. Code is available at https://github.com/Singularity0104/equilibrium-planner.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation is a crucial and useful technology for virtual human interaction and film-making. While recent advances have focused on improving image fidelity and lip synchronization, generating accurate emotional expressions remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce EmoGene, a novel framework for synthesizing high-fidelity, audio-driven video portraits with accurate emotional expressions. Our approach employs a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based audio-to-motion module to generate facial landmarks, which are concatenated with emotional embedding in a motion-to-emotion module to produce emotional landmarks. These landmarks drive a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based emotion-to-video module to render realistic emotional talking-head videos. Additionally, we propose a pose sampling method to generate natural idle-state (non-speaking) videos for silent audio inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoGene outperforms previous methods in generating high-fidelity emotional talking-head videos.

Abstract: Designing quantum circuits for specific tasks is challenging due to the exponential growth of the state space. We introduce gadget reinforcement learning (GRL), which integrates reinforcement learning with program synthesis to automatically generate and incorporate composite gates (gadgets) into the action space. This enhances the exploration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for complex tasks like approximating ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, an NP-hard problem. We evaluate GRL using the transverse field Ising model under typical computational budgets (e.g., 2- 3 days of GPU runtime). Our results show improved accuracy, hardware compatibility and scalability. GRL exhibits robust performance as the size and complexity of the problem increases, even with constrained computational resources. By integrating gadget extraction, GRL facilitates the discovery of reusable circuit components tailored for specific hardware, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and practical implementation. This makes GRL a versatile framework for optimizing quantum circuits with applications in hardware-specific optimizations and variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with environmental constraints such as corridors and furniture. Previous methods fail to consider all types of interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different components in the environment and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal (st) graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous st-graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions among entities through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success and efficiency in challenging navigation scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our pipeline achieves better zero-shot generalization capability than previous works when the densities of humans and obstacles change.

Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.

Abstract: Traditional greedy tokenization methods have been a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), influencing how text is converted into tokens and directly impacting model performance. While subword tokenizers like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used, questions remain about their optimality across model scales and languages. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.

Abstract: Do generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, trained only to predict the next token, implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We address this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for input sequences and present a confidence score. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled environment using the setup and rules of the Othello and Chess strategy games. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on out-of-distribution synthetic data consisting of sequences of random legal moves. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate legal next moves for out-of-distribution sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In cases for which the GPT model generates illegal moves it also fails to capture any causal structure.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.

We define the summarizer rate-distortion function and show that it provides a fundamental lower bound on summarizer performance. We describe an iterative procedure, similar to Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, for computing this function. To handle real-world text datasets, we also propose a practical method that can calculate the summarizer rate-distortion function with limited data. Finally, we empirically confirm our theoretical results by comparing the summarizer rate-distortion function with the performances of different summarizers used in practice.

Abstract: As probabilistic models continue to permeate various facets of our society and contribute to scientific advancements, it becomes a necessity to go beyond traditional metrics such as predictive accuracy and error rates and assess their trustworthiness. Grounded in the competence-based theory of trust, this work formalizes I-trustworthy framework -- a novel framework for assessing the trustworthiness of probabilistic classifiers for inference tasks by linking local calibration to trustworthiness. To assess I-trustworthiness, we use the local calibration error (LCE) and develop a method of hypothesis-testing. This method utilizes a kernel-based test statistic, Kernel Local Calibration Error (KLCE), to test local calibration of a probabilistic classifier. This study provides theoretical guarantees by offering convergence bounds for an unbiased estimator of KLCE. Additionally, we present a diagnostic tool designed to identify and measure biases in cases of miscalibration. The effectiveness of the proposed test statistic is demonstrated through its application to both simulated and real-world datasets. Finally, LCE of related recalibration methods is studied, and we provide evidence of insufficiency of existing methods to achieve I-trustworthiness.

<title>From Foresight to Forethought: VLM-In-the-Loop Policy Steering via Latent Alignment</title>

Abstract: While generative robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in learning complex, multimodal behaviors from demonstrations, they still exhibit diverse failures at deployment-time. Policy steering offers an elegant solution to reducing the chance of failure by using an external verifier to select from low-level actions proposed by an imperfect generative policy. Here, one might hope to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a verifier, leveraging its open-world reasoning capabilities. However, off-the-shelf VLMs struggle to understand the consequences of low-level robot actions as they are represented fundamentally differently than the text and images the VLM was trained on. In response, we propose FOREWARN, a novel framework to unlock the potential of VLMs as open-vocabulary verifiers for runtime policy steering. Our key idea is to decouple the VLM's burden of predicting action outcomes (foresight) from evaluation (forethought). For foresight, we leverage a latent world model to imagine future latent states given diverse low-level action plans. For forethought, we align the VLM with these predicted latent states to reason about the consequences of actions in its native representation--natural language--and effectively filter proposed plans. We validate our framework across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its ability to bridge representational gaps and provide robust, generalizable policy steering.

arXiv:2502.01976v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs \& LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a widely adopted visual imitation learning method in robot manipulation. Current BC approaches often enhance generalization by leveraging large datasets and incorporating additional visual and textual modalities to capture more diverse information. However, these methods overlook whether the learned representations contain redundant information and lack a solid theoretical foundation to guide the learning process. To address these limitations, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and introduce mutual information to quantify and mitigate redundancy in latent representations. Building on this, we incorporate the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle into BC, which extends the idea of reducing redundancy by providing a structured framework for compressing irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant features. This work presents the first comprehensive study on redundancy in latent representations across various methods, backbones, and experimental settings, while extending the generalizability of the IB to BC. Extensive experiments and analyses on the CortexBench and LIBERO benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements with IB, underscoring the importance of reducing input data redundancy and highlighting its practical value for more practical applications.

Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for fractional-order linear time-invariant (FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, Fractional-Order Learning for Optimal Control (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.

<title>Design and Implementation of a Dual Uncrewed Surface Vessel Platform for Bathymetry Research under High-flow Conditions</title>

Abstract: Bathymetry, the study of underwater topography, relies on sonar mapping of submerged structures. These measurements, critical for infrastructure health monitoring, often require expensive instrumentation. The high financial risk associated with sensor damage or vessel loss creates a reluctance to deploy uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) for bathymetry. However, the crewed-boat bathymetry operations, are costly, pose hazards to personnel, and frequently fail to achieve the stable conditions necessary for bathymetry data collection, especially under high currents. Further research is essential to advance autonomous control, navigation, and data processing technologies, with a particular focus on bathymetry. There is a notable lack of accessible hardware platforms that allow for integrated research in both bathymetry-focused autonomous control and navigation, as well as data evaluation and processing. This paper addresses this gap through the design and implementation of two complementary USV systems tailored for uncrewed bathymetry research. This includes a low-cost USV for Navigation And Control research (NAC-USV) and a second, high-end USV equipped with a high-resolution multi-beam sonar and the associated hardware for Bathymetry data quality Evaluation and Post-processing research (BEP-USV). The NAC-USV facilitates the investigation of autonomous, fail-safe navigation and control, emphasizing the stability requirements for high-quality bathymetry data collection while minimizing the risk to equipment. The BEP-USV, which mirrors the NAC-USV hardware, is then used for additional control validation and in-depth exploration of bathymetry data evaluation and post-processing methodologies. We detail the design and implementation of both systems, and open source the design. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in a range of operational scenarios.

<title>RestoreGrad: Signal Restoration Using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models with Jointly Learned Prior</title>

arXiv:2502.13574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can be utilized for recovering a clean signal from its degraded observation(s) by conditioning the model on the degraded signal. The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.

<title>Soybean Disease Detection via Interpretable Hybrid CNN-GNN: Integrating MobileNetV2 and GraphSAGE with Cross-Modal Attention</title>

Abstract: Soybean leaf disease detection is critical for agricultural productivity but faces challenges due to visually similar symptoms and limited interpretability in conventional methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves $97.16\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\le95.04\%$) and traditional machine learning models ($\le77.05\%$). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.

Abstract: This paper presents ArticuBot, in which a single learned policy enables a robotics system to open diverse categories of unseen articulated objects in the real world. This task has long been challenging for robotics due to the large variations in the geometry, size, and articulation types of such objects. Our system, Articubot, consists of three parts: generating a large number of demonstrations in physics-based simulation, distilling all generated demonstrations into a point cloud-based neural policy via imitation learning, and performing zero-shot sim2real transfer to real robotics systems. Utilizing sampling-based grasping and motion planning, our demonstration generalization pipeline is fast and effective, generating a total of 42.3k demonstrations over 322 training articulated objects. For policy learning, we propose a novel hierarchical policy representation, in which the high-level policy learns the sub-goal for the end-effector, and the low-level policy learns how to move the end-effector conditioned on the predicted goal. We demonstrate that this hierarchical approach achieves much better object-level generalization compared to the non-hierarchical version. We further propose a novel weighted displacement model for the high-level policy that grounds the prediction into the existing 3D structure of the scene, outperforming alternative policy representations. We show that our learned policy can zero-shot transfer to three different real robot settings: a fixed table-top Franka arm across two different labs, and an X-Arm on a mobile base, opening multiple unseen articulated objects across two labs, real lounges, and kitchens.

Abstract: Federated learning leverages data across institutions to improve clinical discovery while complying with data-sharing restrictions and protecting patient privacy. As the evolution of biobanks in genetics and systems biology has proved, accessing more extensive and varied data pools leads to a faster and more robust exploration and translation of results. More widespread use of federated learning may have the same impact in bioinformatics, allowing access to many combinations of genotypic, phenotypic and environmental information that are undercovered or not included in existing biobanks. This paper reviews the methodological, infrastructural and legal issues that academic and clinical institutions must address before implementing it. Finally, we provide recommendations for the reliable use of federated learning and its effective translation into clinical practice.

Summary: <br /> 
The paper explores the impact of data sampling on the reliability of fairness metrics in machine learning models. It introduces FairMatch, a post-processing method that uses propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias in test data. By identifying control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores and adjusting decision thresholds for different subgroups, FairMatch locates unbiased subsets and reduces bias in the remaining data. The approach also includes probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions for unmatched samples. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FairMatch in improving fairness evaluation and mitigation without sacrificing predictive performance. <div>

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age) while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly. For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall, propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.

<div> Keywords: Satellite-based estimates, greenhouse gas properties, Optimal Estimation, uncertainty quantification, diffusion-based approach

Summary: 
Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas properties play a crucial role in understanding and monitoring terrestrial systems and the carbon cycle. Retrieval of GHG concentrations from solar spectra observations is a challenging non-linear Bayesian inverse problem solved using the computationally expensive Optimal Estimation (OE) algorithm. However, the current method leads to convergence issues and overly confident uncertainty estimates. The upcoming satellite missions will generate significantly more data, necessitating fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification. To address this, a diffusion-based approach is proposed to retrieve Gaussian or non-Gaussian posteriors for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, offering a substantial computational speed-up compared to current approaches. This advancement is crucial for achieving near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks, essential for informing policy decisions.

Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Understanding physiological responses during running is critical for performance optimization, tailored training prescriptions, and athlete health management. We introduce a comprehensive framework -- what we believe to be the first capable of predicting instantaneous oxygen consumption (VO$_{2}$) trajectories exclusively from consumer-grade wearable data. Our approach employs two complementary physiological models: (1) accurate modeling of heart rate (HR) dynamics via a physiologically constrained ordinary differential equation (ODE) and neural Kalman filter, trained on over 3 million HR observations, achieving 1-second interval predictions with mean absolute errors as low as 2.81\,bpm (correlation 0.87); and (2) leveraging the principles of precise HR modeling, a novel VO$_{2}$ prediction architecture requiring only the initial second of VO$_{2}$ data for calibration, enabling robust, sequence-to-sequence metabolic demand estimation. Despite relying solely on smartwatch and chest-strap data, our method achieves mean absolute percentage errors of approximately 13\%, effectively capturing rapid physiological transitions and steady-state conditions across diverse running intensities. Our synchronized dataset, complemented by blood lactate measurements, further lays the foundation for future noninvasive metabolic zone identification. By embedding physiological constraints within modern machine learning, this framework democratizes advanced metabolic monitoring, bridging laboratory-grade accuracy and everyday accessibility, thus empowering both elite athletes and recreational fitness enthusiasts.

<div> Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density Filter, Ensemble, Kernel-Based, Multi-Target, Filtering <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (EnGM-PHD) filter for multi-target filtering applications. This filter combines Gaussian mixture techniques from the GM-PHD filter with particle-based methods from the SMC-PHD filter. By utilizing Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to approximate the prior intensity function, the EnGM-PHD filter ensures convergence to the true intensity function as the number of components increases. In scenarios with a single target and no additional complexities, the EnGM-PHD filter simplifies to the Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF). Experimental results demonstrate that the EnGM-PHD filter outperforms both the GM-PHD and SMC-PHD filters in multi-target filtering while using the same number of components or particles. This innovative approach shows promising potential for enhancing multi-target tracking performance in various applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In this work, a kernel-based Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (EnGM-PHD) filter is presented for multi-target filtering applications. The EnGM-PHD filter combines the Gaussian-mixture-based techniques of the Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter with the particle-based techniques of the Sequential Monte Carlo Probability Hypothesis Density (SMC-PHD) filter. It achieves this by obtaining particles from the posterior intensity function, propagating them through the system dynamics, and then using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques to approximate the Gaussian mixture of the prior intensity function. This approach guarantees convergence to the true intensity function in the limit of the number of components. Moreover, in the special case of a single target with no births, deaths, clutter, and perfect detection probability, the EnGM-PHD filter reduces to the standard Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF). In the presented experiment, the results indicate that the EnGM-PHD filter achieves better multi-target filtering performance than both the GM-PHD and SMC-PHD filters while using the same number of components or particles.

Summary: 
Python is widely used in AI software development, with libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow leveraging built-in parallelization for speedup on CPUs. However, performance issues may arise when only using low-level parallelization. This study introduces a novel approach of integrating task-based C++ code using the HPX asynchronous runtime model into Python via pybind11. A parallel Gaussian process (GP) library, GPRat, was developed to combine the ease of use of existing GP libraries with the scalability and performance of asynchronous runtimes. Performance evaluation on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrated minimal overhead when binding the HPX code with pybind11. GPRat outperformed GPyTorch and GPflow in terms of scalability on training tasks, with significant prediction speedups. These findings highlight the potential of employing asynchronous tasks in Python-based AI applications.

Abstract: Python is the de-facto language for software development in artificial intelligence (AI). Commonly used libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, rely on parallelization built into their BLAS backends to achieve speedup on CPUs. However, only applying parallelization in a low-level backend can lead to performance and scaling degradation. In this work, we present a novel way of binding task-based C++ code built on the asynchronous runtime model HPX to a high-level Python API using pybind11. We develop a parallel Gaussian process (GP) li- brary as an application. The resulting Python library GPRat combines the ease of use of commonly available GP libraries with the performance and scalability of asynchronous runtime systems. We evaluate the per- formance on a mass-spring-damper system, a standard benchmark from control theory, for varying numbers of regressors (features). The results show almost no binding overhead when binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat shows superior scaling on up to 64 cores on an AMD EPYC 7742 CPU for train- ing. Furthermore, our library achieves a prediction speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow. If we increase the number of features from eight to 128, we observe speedups of 29.62 and 21.19, respectively. These results showcase the potential of using asynchronous tasks within Python-based AI applications.

Abstract: Efficient optimization remains a fundamental challenge across numerous scientific and engineering domains, especially when objective function and gradient evaluations are computationally expensive. While zeroth-order optimization methods offer effective approaches when gradients are inaccessible, their practical performance can be limited by the high cost associated with function queries. This work introduces the bi-fidelity stochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a novel zeroth-order optimization method designed to reduce this computational burden. BF-SSD leverages a bi-fidelity framework, constructing a surrogate model from a combination of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) and accurate high-fidelity (HF) function evaluations. This surrogate model facilitates an efficient backtracking line search for step size selection, for which we provide theoretical convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of BF-SSD across four distinct problems: a synthetic optimization benchmark, dual-form kernel ridge regression, black-box adversarial attacks on machine learning models, and transformer-based black-box language model fine-tuning. Numerical results demonstrate that BF-SSD consistently achieves superior optimization performance while requiring significantly fewer HF function evaluations compared to relevant baseline methods. This study highlights the efficacy of integrating bi-fidelity strategies within zeroth-order optimization, positioning BF-SSD as a promising and computationally efficient approach for tackling large-scale, high-dimensional problems encountered in various real-world applications.

Summary:
This study introduces an interpretable deep learning framework for predicting recurrence in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). By incorporating vector embeddings for categorical variables like smoking status and treatment history, the model can capture complex relationships and improve prediction accuracy. The framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving 70% accuracy with tabular data. Additionally, it provides clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting influential features through attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the model identifies new factors affecting recurrence risk, such as surgical duration and hospital stay, which were not previously considered in NMIBC prediction models. This approach presents a promising solution to the challenges of NMIBC recurrence prediction, offering both improved performance and enhanced interpretability for clinical decision-making.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a relentless challenge in oncology, with recurrence rates soaring as high as 70-80%. Each recurrence triggers a cascade of invasive procedures, lifelong surveillance, and escalating healthcare costs - affecting 460,000 individuals worldwide. However, existing clinical prediction tools remain fundamentally flawed, often overestimating recurrence risk and failing to provide personalized insights for patient management. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning framework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve NMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for categorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments, allowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes and recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the data, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction performance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential features contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves accuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical methods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through feature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new important factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and hospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction models.

Abstract: Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and thyroid disorders, are the leading causes of premature mortality worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fail due to the complex nature of these conditions. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict chronic disease and thyroid disorders. We used a variety of models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Neural Networks (NN), Decision Trees (DT) and Native Bayes (NB), to analyze and predict disease outcomes. Our methodology involved comprehensive data pre-processing, including handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature aggregation, followed by model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such ad precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used to assess the effectiveness of each model. The results demonstrated that ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees consistently outperformed. Neutral Networks also showed superior performance, particularly in capturing complex data patterns. The findings highlight the potential of ML and DL in revolutionizing chronic disease prediction, enabling early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and the need for advanced computational techniques in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of chronic diseases. This study was conducted as part of Big Data class project under the supervision of our professors Mr. Abderrahmane EZ-ZAHOUT and Mr. Abdessamad ESSAIDI.

<div> Keywords: Sparse autoencoders, dictionary learning, progressive coding, Matryoshka SAEs, interpretability <br />
Summary: <br />
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) utilize dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural networks at scale. However, they are computationally expensive, especially when multiple SAEs of different sizes are required. This study reveals that dictionary importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. A comparison is made between progressive coding through subset pruning of SAEs and training nested SAEs known as Matryoshka SAEs on a language modeling task. Matryoshka SAEs demonstrate lower reconstruction and recaptured language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. On the other hand, pruned vanilla SAEs are more interpretable. The trade-off between interpretability and performance in these approaches is discussed, shedding light on the origins and implications of this phenomenon. <br />

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) \citep{bricken2023monosemanticity,gao2024scalingevaluatingsparseautoencoders} rely on dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural networks at scale in an unsupervised manner, with applications to representation engineering and information retrieval. SAEs are, however, computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs \citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however. We discuss the origins and implications of this trade-off.

Summary:
Our study introduces a novel manifold learning framework for capturing subject-specific spatial variations in neuroimaging data. The framework shows superior performance on simulated and real fMRI datasets compared to group-based methods. It can efficiently scale to large datasets and generalize well to new subjects. Application of the framework to resting-state fMRI data from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls reveals clinically relevant brain activity patterns. These patterns include increased activation in regions such as the basal ganglia and visual areas, as well as decreased activation in regions like the insula and angular gyrus. The individualized spatial maps generated by our model offer valuable insights for computational neuroscience and clinical research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental and cognitive representations are believed to reside on low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds embedded within high-dimensional brain activity. Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in computational neuroscience and clinical research.

Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing systems.

<div> Algorithm, Generative AI, Ensembles, Nash Equilibrium, Federated Learning
Summary:<br /><br />This article introduces a novel approach to constructing ensemble models using proprietary generative AIs and feature encoders. By viewing the problem through a game-theoretic lens, the unique Nash equilibrium is identified and computed in closed-form, allowing for decentralized optimization without revealing internal structures. The proposed "proprietary federated learning" algorithm is implemented on various time-series benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in predictive accuracy. The algorithm leverages pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature models, and echo-state networks to achieve superior results. This approach addresses the challenge of working with black-box AI systems, providing a solution for optimizing ensemble models in a competitive setting. <div>
arXiv:2505.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most industry-standard generative AIs and feature encoders are proprietary, offering only black-box access: their outputs are observable, but their internal parameters and architectures remain hidden from the end-user. This black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing AIs.
  We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting, which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning'' algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this natural problem still being largely unexplored.

<div> Transformer model, outage prediction, Customer Satisfaction Impact, interpretability techniques, utility providers <br />
<br />
Summary: The study proposes a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model to enhance Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) predictions during natural disasters. Traditional methods often lack precision, making it challenging for utility providers to communicate reliable ETRs to customers. The LTT model, utilizing historical outage data and sequential updates, significantly improves Customer Satisfaction Impact by 19.08% compared to existing methods. The model incorporates customer-informed regression metrics to align with real-world satisfaction levels. Interpretability techniques are employed to analyze the importance of sequential updates in predicting outage events and to identify key predictive features influencing ETRs. Overall, the LTT model not only enhances predictive accuracy but also promotes transparency and trust in the model's capabilities, crucial for utility providers in efficiently managing power outages during severe weather conditions. <div>

Abstract: As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver precise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has become increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions. Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a 2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency, fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.

Summary: 
The article explores a novel approach to enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential decision-making tasks by leveraging in-context learning from their own successful experiences. Instead of relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, the focus is on constructing and refining a database of self-generated examples. The study demonstrates that simple accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks significantly boosts test performance on three benchmarks. The approach eliminates the need for labor-intensive knowledge engineering and showcases the potential of automatic trajectory database construction in improving agent performance. Extensions introduced, including database-level and exemplar-level selection, further enhance performance on various tasks, matching or even surpassing the capabilities of more complex approaches that utilize task-specific components and prompts.<br /><br />
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%), and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving 91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive knowledge engineering.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine, as an essential component of traditional medicine, contains active ingredients that serve as a crucial source for modern drug development, holding immense therapeutic potential and development value. A multi-layered and complex network is formed from Chinese medicine to diseases and used to predict the potential associations between Chinese medicine ingredients and diseases. This study proposes an ingredient-disease association prediction model (Node2Vec-DGI-EL) based on hierarchical graph representation learning. First, the model uses the Node2Vec algorithm to extract node embedding vectors from the network as the initial features of the nodes. Next, the network nodes are deeply represented and learned using the DGI algorithm to enhance the model's expressive power. To improve prediction accuracy and robustness, an ensemble learning method is incorporated to achieve more accurate ingredient-disease association predictions. The effectiveness of the model is then evaluated through a series of theoretical verifications. The results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperformed existing methods, achieving an AUC of 0.9987 and an AUPR of 0.9545, thereby indicating superior predictive capability. Ablation experiments further revealed the contribution and importance of each module. Additionally, case studies explored potential associations, such as triptonide with hypertensive retinopathy and methyl ursolate with colorectal cancer. Molecular docking experiments validated these findings, showing the triptonide-PGR interaction and the methyl ursolate-NFE2L2 interaction can bind stable. In conclusion, the Node2Vec-DGI-EL model focuses on TCM datasets and effectively predicts ingredient-disease associations, overcoming the reliance on node semantic information.

The article introduces a novel Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural Network (HFGNN) approach to address the privacy concerns of financial data sharing among trans-border organizations. The proposed method involves dividing the heterogeneous business data into subgraphs and constructing a statistically heterogeneous global graph for sharing and circulation through a central server.

Abstract: The sharing of external data has become a strong demand of financial institutions, but the privacy issue has led to the difficulty of interconnecting different platforms and the low degree of data openness. To effectively solve the privacy problem of financial data in trans-border flow and sharing, to ensure that the data is available but not visible, to realize the joint portrait of all kinds of heterogeneous data of business organizations in different industries, we propose a Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural Network (HFGNN) approach. In this method, the distribution of heterogeneous business data of trans-border organizations is taken as subgraphs, and the sharing and circulation process among subgraphs is constructed as a statistically heterogeneous global graph through a central server. Each subgraph learns the corresponding personalized service model through local training to select and update the relevant subset of subgraphs with aggregated parameters, and effectively separates and combines topological and feature information among subgraphs. Finally, our simulation experimental results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy performance and faster convergence speed than existing methods.

Summary: <br />
- The study addresses the challenge of soil moisture estimation from active microwave data using a knowledge-guided deep learning approach that integrates WCM principles into an LSTM model.
- The proposed approach aims to improve performance across diverse agricultural landscapes by leveraging LSTM's ability to capture spatiotemporal dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified dual-component loss function.
- By incorporating soil backscatter coefficients, Landsat-resolution vegetation information, and surface characteristics, the model achieves a reduction in soil moisture retrieval uncertainties and correlation coefficients of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and surface conditions.
- The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach to address the limitations of the empirical component in the water cloud model and provide more accurate soil moisture estimates.
- A four-fold spatial cross-validation against in-situ soil moisture data confirms the effectiveness of the model in improving soil moisture estimation accuracy. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) estimation from active microwave data remains challenging due to the complex interactions between radar backscatter and surface characteristics. While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical approach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often limits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research presents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning approach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified dual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and a boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the soil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together with Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A four-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to assess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM retrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation coefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and surface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the over-simplification in WCM.

By using policies from neural networks trained on match data, alongside strength scores, the method improves strength estimation accuracy in Go and chess.

Abstract: Accurately estimating human skill levels is crucial for designing effective human-AI interactions so that AI can provide appropriate challenges or guidance. In games where AI players have beaten top human professionals, strength estimation plays a key role in adapting AI behavior to match human skill levels. In a previous state-of-the-art study, researchers have proposed a strength estimator trained using human players' match data. Given some matches, the strength estimator computes strength scores and uses them to estimate player ranks (skill levels). In this paper, we focus on the observation that human players' behavior tendency varies according to their strength and aim to improve the accuracy of strength estimation by taking this into account. Specifically, in addition to strength scores, we obtain policies for different skill levels from neural networks trained using human players' match data. We then combine features based on these policies with the strength scores to estimate strength. We conducted experiments on Go and chess. For Go, our method achieved an accuracy of 80% in strength estimation when given 10 matches, which increased to 92% when given 20 matches. In comparison, the previous state-of-the-art method had an accuracy of 71% with 10 matches and 84% with 20 matches, demonstrating improvements of 8-9%. We observed similar improvements in chess. These results contribute to developing a more accurate strength estimation method and to improving human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Molecular odor prediction is the process of using a molecule's structure to predict its smell. While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can suggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic descriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder effective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class imbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these challenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature Mapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature extraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor prediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we integrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically learns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's capability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the molecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global information and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To further mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed Loss (CIL). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance across various deep learning models, highlighting its potential to advance molecular structure representation and accelerate the development of AI-driven technologies.

<br />
Summary:
Recurrent Graph Neural Networks with sum aggregation and ReLU activation have tight bounds on expressivity with finite-precision parameters. They can mimic any graph algorithm respecting the message-passing invariance of the color refinement algorithm, reaching the expressive power limit unlike non-recurrent GNNs. Incorporating random initialization enables recurrent GNNs to emulate all graph algorithms, indicating that any polynomial-time complexity graph algorithm can be emulated by a recurrent GNN with random initialization, running in polynomial time. <div>

Abstract: We provide first tight bounds for the expressivity of Recurrent Graph Neural Networks (recurrent GNNs) with finite-precision parameters. We prove that recurrent GNNs, with sum aggregation and ReLU activation, can emulate any graph algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the color refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI 2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually reach this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where every graph size requires a different GNN model to compute with. The emulation we construct introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space.
  Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, recurrent GNNs can emulate all graph algorithms, implying in particular that any graph algorithm with polynomial-time complexity can be emulated by a recurrent GNN with random initialization, running in polynomial time.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes. Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures. Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore, TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.

Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

<div> Sparse Attention, Large Language Models, Mixture of Sparse Attention, Computational Complexity, Self-Attention <br />
<br />
Summary: Recent research on large language models has highlighted the computational inefficiency of self-attention mechanisms due to their quadratic complexity. In response, a new approach called Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA) has been introduced, inspired by the concept of Mixture of Experts (MoE). By dynamically selecting tokens for attention heads, MoSA allows for arbitrary sparse attention patterns, reducing computational complexity from O(T^2) to O(k^2 + T) by selecting k tokens from a sequence of length T. This facilitates the use of more attention heads within the same computational budget, leading to improved performance. MoSA surpassed other sparse attention methods tested, showing up to 27% better perplexity with identical compute resources. Moreover, it demonstrated reduced resource usage compared to dense self-attention models, achieving faster training times, lower memory requirements, and a smaller KV-cache size even without optimized implementations. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA), a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel, perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time, require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach using a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model with a U-Net architecture to accelerate evaluations of a Cellular-Potts model (CPM) for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. The CNN model accounts for periodic boundary conditions and predicts 100 computational steps ahead, resulting in a significant 590 times acceleration compared to traditional CPM code execution. Despite the speed increase, the surrogate model effectively captures emergent behaviors such as vessel sprouting, extension, anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae observed in the original CPM. This demonstrates the potential of deep learning as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluations of computationally expensive biological processes on larger spatial and temporal scales. By combining the strengths of CNNs and CPMs, this innovative approach opens new possibilities for modeling intricate biological systems with enhanced efficiency and scalability. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.00316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.

arXiv:2505.00326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense, and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust, delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a wireless federated learning framework called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that fine-tunes compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large models to address resource constraints and communication overhead. A novel convergence analysis shows how LoRA rank and covariance effects impact training dynamics in federated learning.

Additionally, the Two Stage Federated Algorithm (TSFA) is presented to adjust bandwidth and sparsification dynamically to ensure efficient training under latency constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this approach achieves comparable accuracy to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing communication overhead. This framework enables the scalable and resource-efficient deployment of large models in real-world wireless federated learning scenarios.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations. Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA}) algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation, and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic, pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed. The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video generation.

<div> Keywords: optimizer, ultra-low-precision quantization, memory savings, computational resources, research accessibility

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel optimizer, SOLO, designed to reduce training and fine-tuning costs for large models by utilizing ultra-low-precision quantization. By operating at precision as low as 3 bits per state element, SOLO addresses challenges such as signal swamping and gradient variance to achieve significant memory savings of approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model. The optimizer overcomes limitations in traditional quantization methods by incorporating logarithmic quantization for signal dynamics and precision-specific momentum values for gradient descent directions. Despite the minimal loss in accuracy, SOLO offers substantial benefits in terms of computational resource efficiency. By enabling more efficient utilization of resources, SOLO aims to improve accessibility to fundamental research in the field of machine learning. <div>
arXiv:2505.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosion in model sizes leads to continued growth in prohibitive training/fine-tuning costs, particularly for stateful optimizers which maintain auxiliary information of even 2x the model size to achieve optimal convergence. We therefore present in this work a novel type of optimizer that carries with extremely lightweight state overloads, achieved through ultra-low-precision quantization. While previous efforts have achieved certain success with 8-bit or 4-bit quantization, our approach enables optimizers to operate at precision as low as 3 bits, or even 2 bits per state element. This is accomplished by identifying and addressing two critical challenges: the signal swamping problem in unsigned quantization that results in unchanged state dynamics, and the rapidly increased gradient variance in signed quantization that leads to incorrect descent directions. The theoretical analysis suggests a tailored logarithmic quantization for the former and a precision-specific momentum value for the latter. Consequently, the proposed SOLO achieves substantial memory savings (approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model) with minimal accuracy loss. We hope that SOLO can contribute to overcoming the bottleneck in computational resources, thereby promoting greater accessibility in fundamental research.

Abstract: Accurate household electrical energy demand prediction is essential for effectively managing sustainable Energy Communities. Integrated with the Energy Management System, these communities aim to optimise operational costs. However, most existing forecasting models are region-specific and depend on large datasets, limiting their applicability across different climates and geographical areas. These models often lack flexibility and may not perform well in regions with limited historical data, leading to inaccurate predictions. This paper proposes a global model for 24-hour-ahead hourly electrical energy demand prediction that is designed to perform effectively across diverse climate conditions and datasets. The model's efficiency is demonstrated using data from two distinct regions: Ireland, with a maritime climate and Vietnam, with a tropical climate. Remarkably, the model achieves high accuracy even with a limited dataset spanning only nine months. Its robustness is further validated across different seasons in Ireland (summer and winter) and Vietnam (dry and wet). The proposed model is evaluated against state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods. Simulation results indicate that the model consistently outperforms benchmark models, showcasing its capability to provide reliable forecasts globally, regardless of varying climatic conditions and data availability. This research underscores the model's potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Energy Communities worldwide. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 8.0% and 4.0% on the full Irish and Vietnamese datasets.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices necessitates effective model com- pression strategies that judiciously balance the reduction of model size with the preservation of performance. This study introduces a novel safety-driven quantization framework that leverages preservation sets to systematically prune and quantize neural network weights, thereby optimizing model complexity without compromising accuracy. The proposed methodology is rigorously evaluated on both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention-based language model, demonstrating its applicability across diverse architectural paradigms. Experimental results reveal that our framework achieves up to a 2.5% enhancement in test accuracy relative to the original unquantized models while maintaining 60% of the initial model size. In comparison to conventional quantization techniques, our approach not only augments generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential weights but also reduces variance, thereby ensuring the retention of critical model features. These findings underscore the efficacy of safety-driven quantization as a robust and reliable strategy for the efficient optimization of deep learn- ing models. The implementation and comprehensive experimental evaluations of our framework are publicly accessible at GitHub.

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called R&amp;B that addresses limitations in existing data mixing strategies for training language models. R&amp;B re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity to create finer-grained domains and optimizes data composition efficiently using a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients. Unlike previous methods, R&amp;B does not require additional compute for evaluation purposes. The article provides theoretical insights into the effectiveness of R&amp;B compared to non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirical results demonstrate that R&amp;B achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets with minimal additional computational overhead, matching or exceeding the performance of existing strategies. This approach offers a more flexible and efficient way to improve language model training by considering semantic nuances and optimizing data composition. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws. First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via R&amp;B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity (Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and provide theoretical insights that justify R&amp;B's effectiveness compared to non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of R&amp;B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&amp;B matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

This fully online algorithm adaptively determines clustering radii using local similarity and micro-clustering to handle multi-density data. It addresses the challenge of complexly varying data densities and uses Locality-Sensitive Hashing for efficiency in high-dimensional cases. TNStream offers improved clustering quality for multi-density data by summarizing data evolution in micro-clusters and forming final clusters based on Tightest Neighbors. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of TNStream and the proposed data stream clustering theory.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In data stream clustering, systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms remains relatively scarce. Recently, density-based methods have gained attention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity, summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge of storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.

Summary: 
Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to attribute model predictions to specific subgraphs, but existing methods may overlook long-range dependencies. This paper introduces the Tree-like Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, transforming plain GNNs into hierarchical trees with coarsened graphs of varying granularity. TIF utilizes a graph coarsening module to compress original graphs into coarser ones while maintaining diversity among tree nodes. An adaptive routing module identifies informative root-to-leaf paths, offering multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making process. Experimental results on various datasets show TIF's superiority in interpretability and competitive prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability, they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g., relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids, and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a graph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees) into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces SacFL, a novel federated continual learning framework designed for end devices dealing with dynamic data. SacFL utilizes an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, reducing storage demands. It incorporates contrastive learning for autonomous data shift detection, enabling the device to detect new tasks and implement appropriate strategies independently. The framework is effective in class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios, as demonstrated through experiments on various datasets. A demo system confirms the practicality of SacFL for on-device machine learning applications. <div>
arXiv:2505.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm, wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution, preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices. Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system has been developed to verify its practicality.

Summary:
TransPDT is a Transformer-based model for package delivery time prediction in mixed logistics scenarios. It addresses the challenges of interlinked spatiotemporal factors, strict time constraints for pickups, and underexplored courier spatial mobility patterns. The model uses the Transformer encoder to capture dependencies in couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets. It incorporates a pattern memory with attention mechanism to handle the impact of pickups in the dataset. Additionally, route prediction is used as an auxiliary task to improve delivery time prediction accuracy. Experimental results on real industry-scale datasets show the effectiveness of TransPDT. The model has been deployed in JD Logistics to track over 2000 couriers handling large package volumes daily in Beijing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers' spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior, but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT, a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets. Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in Beijing.

Summary: 
This paper delves into the theoretical analysis of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) in reinforcement learning by constructing a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based on the DQN algorithm. By estimating the Wasserstein-1 distance between the two, the authors provide an upper bound for the distance and prove its convergence to zero as the step size decreases. The study highlights the significance of DQN's techniques, such as experience replay and the target network, through the lens of continuous systems. Particularly, the delay term in the equation, linked to the target network, is shown to enhance the system's stability. The research utilizes a refined Lindeberg principle and operator comparison to establish these findings. <div>

Abstract: Despite the significant breakthroughs that the Deep Q-Network (DQN) has brought to reinforcement learning, its theoretical analysis remains limited. In this paper, we construct a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based on the DQN algorithm and estimate the Wasserstein-1 distance between them. We provide an upper bound for the distance and prove that the distance between the two converges to zero as the step size approaches zero. This result allows us to understand DQN's two key techniques, the experience replay and the target network, from the perspective of continuous systems. Specifically, the delay term in the equation, corresponding to the target network, contributes to the stability of the system. Our approach leverages a refined Lindeberg principle and an operator comparison to establish these results.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation in Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with changing constraints. Existing approaches often allow occasional safety breaches, but this approach ensures strict safety with gradually evolving constraints. By employing a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in the dual space, the framework maintains zero constraint violation even with small changes in constraints between consecutive rounds. The use of a dichotomous learning rate enables both safety and sublinear regret. This work provides the first provable guarantees for maintaining absolute safety in OCO when constraints change dynamically. <div>

Abstract: We present the first theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation in Online Convex Optimization (OCO) across all rounds, addressing dynamic constraint changes. Unlike existing approaches in constrained OCO, which allow for occasional safety breaches, we provide the first approach for maintaining strict safety under the assumption of gradually evolving constraints, namely the constraints change at most by a small amount between consecutive rounds. This is achieved through a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in the dual space. We show that employing a dichotomous learning rate enables ensuring both safety, via zero constraint violation, and sublinear regret. Our framework marks a departure from previous work by providing the first provable guarantees for maintaining absolute safety in the face of changing constraints in OCO.

<div> Keywords: couriers, delivery timely rates, anomaly scenarios, deep spatial-temporal attention model, logistics industry

Summary:<br /><br />Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates is crucial in the logistics industry, especially during anomaly scenarios like the COVID-19 outbreak. Existing studies often overlook logistics scenarios and fail to explicitly model abnormal events, leading to information loss. To address these challenges, a deep spatial-temporal attention model, DeepSTA, is proposed. This model incorporates an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module with a recurrent neural network to capture incident information and Node2vec to model correlations between road districts. Graph neural networks and long short-term memory are used to capture spatial-temporal dependencies. An anomaly pattern attention module leveraging memory networks and attention mechanisms addresses data scarcity in abnormal conditions. Experimental results on real-world data from the COVID-19 outbreak showcase DeepSTA's superior performance compared to existing baselines, with a 12.11% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 13.71% improvement in Mean Squared Error (MSE). <div>
arXiv:2505.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.

Abstract: The present research tackles the difficulty of predicting osteoporosis risk via machine learning (ML) approaches, emphasizing the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve model transparency. Osteoporosis is a significant public health concern, sometimes remaining untreated owing to its asymptomatic characteristics, and early identification is essential to avert fractures. The research assesses six machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting and utilizes a dataset based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables. The models are refined using GridSearchCV to calibrate hyperparameters, with the objective of enhancing predictive efficacy. XGBoost had the greatest accuracy (91%) among the evaluated models, surpassing others in precision (0.92), recall (0.91), and F1-score (0.90). The research further integrates XAI approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, and Permutation Feature Importance, to elucidate the decision-making process of the optimal model. The study indicates that age is the primary determinant in forecasting osteoporosis risk, followed by hormonal alterations and familial history. These results corroborate clinical knowledge and affirm the models' therapeutic significance. The research underscores the significance of explainability in machine learning models for healthcare applications, guaranteeing that physicians can rely on the system's predictions. The report ultimately proposes directions for further research, such as validation across varied populations and the integration of supplementary biomarkers for enhanced predictive accuracy.

CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and Adaptation) addresses the challenges of unsupervised time series anomaly detection in the presence of data distribution shifts across domains and non-stationarity over time. The key innovations of CICADA include a mixture of experts (MOE) framework for capturing domain-agnostic anomaly features, a selective meta-learning mechanism for preventing negative transfer between dissimilar domains, an adaptive expansion algorithm for handling emerging heterogeneous domains, and a hierarchical attention structure for enhancing interpretability. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain detection performance and interpretability. <div>

Abstract: Unsupervised Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in applications across industries. However, existing methods face significant challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE) framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Accurate classification of medical device risk levels is essential for regulatory oversight and clinical safety. We present a Transformer-based multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptions and visual information to predict device regulatory classification. The model incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to capture intermodal dependencies and employs a self-training strategy for improved generalization under limited supervision. Experiments on a real-world regulatory dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC, significantly outperforming text-only (77.2%) and image-only (54.8%) baselines. Compared to standard multimodal fusion, the self-training mechanism improved SVM performance by 3.3 percentage points in accuracy (from 87.1% to 90.4%) and 1.4 points in macro-F1, suggesting that pseudo-labeling can effectively enhance generalization under limited supervision. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of both cross-modal attention and self-training.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that successful per-domain generalizing action policies can be learned. Scaling behavior, from small training instances to large test instances, is the key objective; and the use of validation instances larger than training instances is one key to achieve it. Prior work has used fixed validation sets. Here, we introduce a method generating the validation set dynamically, on the fly, increasing instance size so long as informative and feasible.We also introduce refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior, generating test instances systematically to guarantee a given confidence in coverage performance for each instance size. In experiments, dynamic validation improves scaling behavior of GNN policies in all 9 domains used.

Summary:<br />
Neural networks often fail to meet critical safety and correctness properties after training, emphasizing the importance of integrating these properties into training methods. Adversarial training improves robustness to small perturbations in computer vision but may need more flexible input region specifications for domains like control systems and natural language processing. Differentiable logics allow encoding of logical constraints as additional loss terms to guide learning towards satisfying these constraints. This paper explores unifying these approaches into a single framework for property-driven machine learning. Properties from the literature are found to be subcases of this general approach. The practical effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving a neural network controller for a drone system. The framework is openly available for use on GitHub at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

arXiv:2505.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to satisfy critical safety and correctness properties after training, highlighting the pressing need for training methods that incorporate such properties directly. While adversarial training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within $\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Meanwhile, differentiable logics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss terms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In this paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be unified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning. We show that well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general approach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study involving a neural network controller for a drone system. Our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

The article explores the application of a transformer model in predicting outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input signals. These systems exhibit dynamic behavior influenced by both physical parameters and external inputs, making accurate prediction challenging. By extending the transformer model to handle multiple outputs, the proposed multiple-output transformer enhances interpretability.

Abstract: We explore the promising performance of a transformer model in predicting outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input signals. The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and the dimensionality of the parameter space.

Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

<div> Keywords: sparsity, interpretability, self-ablation, language transformers, feature localization

Summary:
The study explores the relationship between sparsity and interpretability in machine learning, particularly in language transformers. They introduce a self-ablation mechanism that enforces selective activation in neuron and attention units during model training. Results show that self-ablation leads to more localized circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron specialization without affecting language modeling performance. Surprisingly, the method decreased overall sparsity while promoting specialization, indicating a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability. The findings suggest that decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization, ultimately enhancing interpretability. The study provides insights into how interpretability can be integrated into model training processes to improve model performance and understanding. The code for the study is publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: A growing intuition in machine learning suggests a link between sparsity and interpretability. We introduce a novel self-ablation mechanism to investigate this connection ante-hoc in the context of language transformers. Our approach dynamically enforces a k-winner-takes-all constraint, forcing the model to demonstrate selective activation across neuron and attention units. Unlike post-hoc methods that analyze already-trained models, our approach integrates interpretability directly into model training, promoting feature localization from inception. Training small models on the TinyStories dataset and employing interpretability tests, we find that self-ablation leads to more localized circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron specialization without compromising language modelling performance. Surprisingly, our method also decreased overall sparsity, indicating that self-ablation promotes specialization rather than widespread inactivity. This reveals a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability, where decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization, leading to enhanced interpretability. To facilitate reproducibility, we make our code available at https://github.com/keenanpepper/self-ablating-transformers.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel RL algorithm called Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO) for molecule generation in drug discovery. Current RL approaches face catastrophic forgetting during the generation process, where molecule validity deteriorates significantly. PSV-PPO addresses this issue by incorporating real-time partial validation of SMILES at each step, allowing early detection of invalid partial structures. This approach ensures high validity rates even during aggressive exploration of the chemical space. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PSV-PPO reduces the number of invalid structures while maintaining competitive exploration and optimization performance. The framework of PSV-PPO can be further extended to incorporate additional domain knowledge, enhancing reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM) has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\% during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating, resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.
  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+. LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6% computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.

<div> EEG, classification, explainable machine learning, Random Forest, brain activity <br />
Summary: <br />
KnowEEG is a new explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification, addressing the issue of model explainability. It extracts per-electrode features, filters them using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity statistics to improve classification performance. The modified Random Forest model, Fusion Forest, balances per-electrode statistics with between-electrode connectivity features, achieving high performance across various classification tasks such as emotion detection and abnormal EEG classification. KnowEEG provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores, allowing for the discovery of knowledge about the classes. This discovered knowledge has been validated by current neuroscience literature, demonstrating the significance of KnowEEG in domains where EEG explainability is crucial, such as healthcare. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification. KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model (Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains, KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection, mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature. Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG explainability is critical such as healthcare.

<title>Directly Forecasting Belief for Reinforcement Learning with Delays</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00546</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with delays is challenging as sensory perceptions lag behind the actual events: the RL agent needs to estimate the real state of its environment based on past observations. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods typically employ recursive, step-by-step forecasting of states. This can cause the accumulation of compounding errors. To tackle this problem, our novel belief estimation method, named Directly Forecasting Belief Transformer (DFBT), directly forecasts states from observations without incrementally estimating intermediate states step-by-step. We theoretically demonstrate that DFBT greatly reduces compounding errors of existing recursively forecasting methods, yielding stronger performance guarantees. In experiments with D4RL offline datasets, DFBT reduces compounding errors with remarkable prediction accuracy. DFBT's capability to forecast state sequences also facilitates multi-step bootstrapping, thus greatly improving learning efficiency. On the MuJoCo benchmark, our DFBT-based method substantially outperforms SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved tremendous success in different domains. However, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models difficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows training in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of both model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we propose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the product of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address the case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix into blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and utilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT. Experimental results show that our method achieves similar or better performance across various tasks with much less floating-point operations (FLOPs) and the number of trainable parameters.

<title>Unlocking the Potential of Linear Networks for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00590</link>

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate. Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by 11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This chapter discusses the opportunities of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) within the realm of spatial analysis. A key objective in spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding. These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new directions.

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), named GERM. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GERM offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the impact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.

Abstract: We introduce Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), an actor-critic algorithm for reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. WPO can be derived as an approximation to Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of all policies projected into a finite-dimensional parameter space (e.g., the weights of a neural network), leading to a simple and completely general closed-form update. The resulting algorithm combines many properties of deterministic and classic policy gradient methods. Like deterministic policy gradients, it exploits knowledge of the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the action. Like classic policy gradients, it can be applied to stochastic policies with arbitrary distributions over actions -- without using the reparameterization trick. We show results on the DeepMind Control Suite and a magnetic confinement fusion task which compare favorably with state-of-the-art continuous control methods.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and reasoning traces will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva.

Abstract: The normal distribution plays a central role in information theory - it is at the same time the best-case signal and worst-case noise distribution, has the greatest representational capacity of any distribution, and offers an equivalence between uncorrelatedness and independence for joint distributions. Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved, been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.

Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of multi-temporal satellite imagery for better functional field boundary delineation using deep learning semantic segmentation architecture on two distinct geographical and multi-scale farming systems of Netherlands and Pakistan. Multidate images of April, August and October 2022 were acquired for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 in sub regions of Netherlands and November 2022, February and March 2023 for selected area of Dunyapur in Pakistan. For Netherlands, Basic registration crop parcels (BRP) vector layer was used as labeled training data. while self-crafted field boundary vector data were utilized for Pakistan. Four deep learning models with UNET architecture were evaluated using different combinations of multi-date images and NDVI stacks in the Netherlands subregions. A comparative analysis of IoU scores assessed the effectiveness of the proposed multi-date NDVI stack approach. These findings were then applied for transfer learning, using pre-trained models from the Netherlands on the selected area in Pakistan. Additionally, separate models were trained using self-crafted field boundary data for Pakistan, and combined models were developed using data from both the Netherlands and Pakistan. Results indicate that multi-date NDVI stacks provide additional temporal context, reflecting crop growth over different times of the season. The study underscores the critical role of multi-scale ground information from diverse geographical areas in developing robust and universally applicable models for field boundary delineation. The results also highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution for extraction of field boundaries in regions with small scale framing. The findings can be extended to multi-scale implementations for improved automatic field boundary delineation in heterogeneous agricultural environments.

Abstract: Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) matrices are a family of parameterized lower-triangular matrices that play an important role in streaming differential privacy with correlated noise. Our main result is a BLT inversion theorem: the inverse of a BLT matrix is itself a BLT matrix with different parameters. We also present an efficient and differentiable $O(d^3)$ algorithm to compute the parameters of the inverse BLT matrix, where $d$ is the degree of the original BLT (typically $d < 10$). Our characterization enables direct optimization of BLT parameters for privacy mechanisms through automatic differentiation.

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual, organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

Abstract: Identifying key biomarkers for COVID-19 from high-dimensional multi-omics data is critical for advancing both diagnostic and pathogenesis research. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm for biomarker-based classification of COVID-19. Proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers from two independent datasets were ranked by importance using ridge regression and grouped accordingly. The top- and bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation, our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-centered tasks, assessing their psychological traits is crucial for understanding their social impact and ensuring trustworthy AI alignment. While existing reviews have covered some aspects of related research, several important areas have not been systematically discussed, including detailed discussions of diverse psychological tests, LLM-specific psychological datasets, and the applications of LLMs with psychological traits. To address this gap, we systematically review six key dimensions of applying psychological theories to LLMs: (1) assessment tools; (2) LLM-specific datasets; (3) evaluation metrics (consistency and stability); (4) empirical findings; (5) personality simulation methods; and (6) LLM-based behavior simulation. Our analysis highlights both the strengths and limitations of current methods. While some LLMs exhibit reproducible personality patterns under specific prompting schemes, significant variability remains across tasks and settings. Recognizing methodological challenges such as mismatches between psychological tools and LLMs' capabilities, as well as inconsistencies in evaluation practices, this study aims to propose future directions for developing more interpretable, robust, and generalizable psychological assessment frameworks for LLMs.

Abstract: Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content, text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent research. Code: https://github.com/tygobl/meme-clustering

<title>Fact-Consistency Evaluation of Text-to-SQL Generation for Business Intelligence Using Exaone 3.5</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation. However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate. Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4), with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases. Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable success in open-book question answering (QA), where the task requires generating answers grounded in a provided external context. A critical challenge in open-book QA is to ensure that model responses are based on the provided context rather than its parametric knowledge, which can be outdated, incomplete, or incorrect. Existing evaluation methods, primarily based on the LLM-as-a-judge approach, face significant limitations, including biases, scalability issues, and dependence on costly external systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric that contrasts the perplexity of the model response under two conditions: when the context is provided and when it is not. The resulting score quantifies the extent to which the model's answer relies on the provided context. The validity of this metric is demonstrated through a series of experiments that show its effectiveness in identifying whether a given answer is grounded in the provided context. Unlike existing approaches, this metric is computationally efficient, interpretable, and adaptable to various use cases, offering a scalable and practical solution to assess context utilization in open-book QA systems.

Abstract: We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear patterns that are challenging for purely classical models. A comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a credit card fraud dataset, ensuring a fair comparison with baseline models. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of 45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in advancing the efficiency and performance of fraud detection systems.

<title>Algorithmic Collective Action with Two Collectives</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Given that data-dependent algorithmic systems have become impactful in more domains of life, the need for individuals to promote their own interests and hold algorithms accountable has grown. To have meaningful influence, individuals must band together to engage in collective action. Groups that engage in such algorithmic collective action are likely to vary in size, membership characteristics, and crucially, objectives. In this work, we introduce a first of a kind framework for studying collective action with two or more collectives that strategically behave to manipulate data-driven systems. With more than one collective acting on a system, unexpected interactions may occur. We use this framework to conduct experiments with language model-based classifiers and recommender systems where two collectives each attempt to achieve their own individual objectives. We examine how differing objectives, strategies, sizes, and homogeneity can impact a collective's efficacy. We find that the unintentional interactions between collectives can be quite significant; a collective acting in isolation may be able to achieve their objective (e.g., improve classification outcomes for themselves or promote a particular item), but when a second collective acts simultaneously, the efficacy of the first group drops by as much as $75\%$. We find that, in the recommender system context, neither fully heterogeneous nor fully homogeneous collectives stand out as most efficacious and that heterogeneity's impact is secondary compared to collective size. Our results signal the need for more transparency in both the underlying algorithmic models and the different behaviors individuals or collectives may take on these systems. This approach also allows collectives to hold algorithmic system developers accountable and provides a framework for people to actively use their own data to promote their own interests.

Abstract: A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors relative to prior work. An overview of the results and link to the code can be found on the project page: http://trajan-paper.github.io.

Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals, utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean exploration and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled high-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as strongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains prohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction strengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning has been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to large-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address this limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on transfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration across a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by interpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate how prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum learning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically implement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and empirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately 200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization stability compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.

Abstract: Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples' interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic: it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion between locations. Our source code and datasets are available at {https://github.com/Higashiguchi-Shingo/D-Tracker.

Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for conducting efficient and robust inference on parameters derived from unstructured data, which include text, images, audio, and video. Economists have long incorporated data extracted from texts and images into their analyses, a practice that has accelerated with advancements in deep neural networks. However, neural networks do not generically produce unbiased predictions, potentially propagating bias to estimators that use their outputs. To address this challenge, we reframe inference with unstructured data as a missing structured data problem, where structured data are imputed from unstructured inputs using deep neural networks. This perspective allows us to apply classic results from semiparametric inference, yielding valid, efficient, and robust estimators based on unstructured data. We formalize this approach with MARS (Missing At Random Structured Data), a unifying framework that integrates and extends existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions, linking them to a variety of older, familiar problems such as causal inference. We develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal estimands and address challenges such as inference using aggregated and transformed predictions from unstructured data. Importantly, MARS applies to common empirical settings that have received limited attention in the existing literature. Finally, we reanalyze prominent studies that use unstructured data, demonstrating the practical value of MARS.

Abstract: To address the challenges of high resource dynamism and intensive task concurrency in microservice systems, this paper proposes an adaptive resource scheduling method based on the A3C reinforcement learning algorithm. The scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, where policy and value networks are jointly optimized to enable fine-grained resource allocation under varying load conditions. The method incorporates an asynchronous multi-threaded learning mechanism, allowing multiple agents to perform parallel sampling and synchronize updates to the global network parameters. This design improves both policy convergence efficiency and model stability. In the experimental section, a real-world dataset is used to construct a scheduling scenario. The proposed method is compared with several typical approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, including task delay, scheduling success rate, resource utilization, and convergence speed. The results show that the proposed method delivers high scheduling performance and system stability in multi-task concurrent environments. It effectively alleviates the resource allocation bottlenecks faced by traditional methods under heavy load, demonstrating its practical value for intelligent scheduling in microservice systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of offline policy learning in reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces when unmeasured confounders are present. While most existing research focuses on policy evaluation within partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and assumes discrete action spaces, we advance this field by establishing a novel identification result to enable the nonparametric estimation of policy value for a given target policy under an infinite-horizon framework. Leveraging this identification, we develop a minimax estimator and introduce a policy-gradient-based algorithm to identify the in-class optimal policy that maximizes the estimated policy value. Furthermore, we provide theoretical results regarding the consistency, finite-sample error bound, and regret bound of the resulting optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real-world application using the German Family Panel data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

Abstract: Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental challenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized medicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning has emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible effect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many covariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverages a phenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the outcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In medicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways frequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically, we demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the CATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We use this structure to incorporate "side information" and develop models that can exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In settings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables more accurate signal detection: yields lower estimation error, reduced false discovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.

Abstract: Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex task for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average (FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing 7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) possess human-like abilities to solve a wide range of real-world problems, exemplifying the potential of experts in various domains and modalities. By leveraging the communication and computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence (AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks. However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management. Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we investigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on channel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and applications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.

Abstract: Games are one of the safest source of realizing self-esteem and relaxation at the same time. An online gaming platform typically has massive data coming in, e.g., in-game actions, player moves, clickstreams, transactions etc. It is rather interesting, as something as simple as data on gaming moves can help create a psychological imprint of the user at that moment, based on her impulsive reactions and response to a situation in the game. Mining this knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired decision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and one-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player psychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic explanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of the two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel formulation of "bridge loss". The network plays pivotal role in obtaining homogeneous and consistent play style definitions and significantly outperforms the SOTA baselines wherever applicable.

<title>Quaternion Wavelet-Conditioned Diffusion Models for Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad applications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work, we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion. Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will be available after the revision process.

<title>Perceptual Implications of Automatic Anonymization in Pathological Speech</title>

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically, human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.

Abstract: A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints, with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

<title>Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems</title>

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects, particularly elastic bands, in real-world scenarios. However, deformable object manipulation (DOM) requires a policy that works on a large state space due to the unlimited degree of freedom (DoF) of deformable objects. Further, their dense but partial observations (e.g., images or point clouds) may increase the sampling complexity and uncertainty in policy learning. To figure it out, we propose a novel implicit neural-representation (INR) learning for elastic DOMs, called INR-DOM. Our method learns consistent state representations associated with partially observable elastic objects reconstructing a complete and implicit surface represented as a signed distance function. Furthermore, we perform exploratory representation fine-tuning through reinforcement learning (RL) that enables RL algorithms to effectively learn exploitable representations while efficiently obtaining a DOM policy. We perform quantitative and qualitative analyses building three simulated environments and real-world manipulation studies with a Franka Emika Panda arm.

Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan Times and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition, existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on over 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing actionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal approaches.

<title>Pre-Training Estimators for Structural Models: Application to Consumer Search</title>

Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator. Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator on 14 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally, pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible to researchers and practitioners.

arXiv:2505.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach, this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment without the need for explicit communication between agents.

<title>Graph Spectral Filtering with Chebyshev Interpolation for Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks in two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially valuable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a fine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum and a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a CF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding, it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of signals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/chanwoo0806/ChebyCF.

Abstract: Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at https://github.com/mengyuest/TeLoGraF

Abstract: In epidemiological settings, Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for hypothesis-free discovery of risk (or protective) factors. Although ML is strong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory. We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.

Abstract: Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in computational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the high cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density functional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for predicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to predict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can significantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on scaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further benefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of WWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data and show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF) predictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models. Comparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that the WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to scaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy predictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to screen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work highlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and microkinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS, providing a robust framework for future catalyst design.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is difficult due to their huge model size. Recent Fourier domain-based methods show potential for reducing fine-tuning costs. We propose a block circulant matrix-based fine-tuning method with a stable training heuristic to leverage the properties of circulant matrices and one-dimensional Fourier transforms to reduce storage and computation costs. Experiments show that our method uses $14\times$ less number of parameters than VeRA, $16\times$ smaller than LoRA and $32\times$ less FLOPs than FourierFT, while maintaining close or better task performance. Our approach presents a promising way in frequency domain to fine-tune large models on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.

Abstract: Automatic disease image grading is a significant application of artificial intelligence for healthcare, enabling faster and more accurate patient assessments. However, domain shifts, which are exacerbated by data imbalance, introduce bias into the model, posing deployment difficulties in clinical applications. To address the problem, we propose a novel \textbf{U}ncertainty-aware \textbf{M}ulti-experts \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{D}istillation (UMKD) framework to transfer knowledge from multiple expert models to a single student model. Specifically, to extract discriminative features, UMKD decouples task-agnostic and task-specific features with shallow and compact feature alignment in the feature space. At the output space, an uncertainty-aware decoupled distillation (UDD) mechanism dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer weights based on expert model uncertainties, ensuring robust and reliable distillation. Additionally, UMKD also tackles the problems of model architecture heterogeneity and distribution discrepancies between source and target domains, which are inadequately tackled by previous KD approaches. Extensive experiments on histology prostate grading (\textit{SICAPv2}) and fundus image grading (\textit{APTOS}) demonstrate that UMKD achieves a new state-of-the-art in both source-imbalanced and target-imbalanced scenarios, offering a robust and practical solution for real-world disease image grading.

DetMCVI solves large problems with a high success rate, outperforming existing baselines for DetPOMDPs. We also verify the performance of the algorithm in a real-world mobile robot forest mapping scenario.

Abstract: Monitoring dietary habits is crucial for preventing health risks associated with overeating and undereating, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies. This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food, allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential. Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The 3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and accurate dietary monitoring tools.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.

Abstract: Existing theoretical work on Bayes-optimal fair classifiers usually considers a single (binary) sensitive feature. In practice, individuals are often defined by multiple sensitive features. In this paper, we characterize the Bayes-optimal fair classifier for multiple sensitive features under general approximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We show that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions, including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and Accuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific groups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become instance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these group membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware and attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions like Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for Bayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We show empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, including document re-ranking. However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains, largely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we investigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs pre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations, such as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring additional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in P@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for zero-shot learning and model adaptation. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/DetectiveMB/Task-Arithmetic-for-ZS-IR.

Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.

<title>On the generalization of language models from in-context learning and finetuning: a controlled study</title>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing logical deductions that can be made from trained information. These failures to generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models. However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases, and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining, to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context, or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language models, and practically improving their performance.

<title>DeepCritic: Deliberate Critique with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Urban Air Quality Management: Multi-Objective Optimization of Pollution Mitigation Booth Placement in Metropolitan Environments</title>

Abstract: Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy. To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance. However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

Abstract: This text presents an introduction to an emerging paradigm in control of dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control.
  The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies.
  This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.

Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning aims at combating distributional uncertainties in training data distributions compared to population distributions. Typical treatment frameworks include the Bayesian approach, (min-max) distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and regularization. However, three issues have to be raised: 1) the prior distribution in the Bayesian method and the regularizer in the regularization method are difficult to specify; 2) the DRO method tends to be overly conservative; 3) all the three methods are biased estimators of the true optimal cost. This paper studies a new framework that unifies the three approaches and addresses the three challenges above. The asymptotic properties (e.g., consistencies and asymptotic normalities), non-asymptotic properties (e.g., generalization bounds and unbiasedness), and solution methods of the proposed model are studied. The new model reveals the trade-off between the robustness to the unseen data and the specificity to the training data. Experiments on various real-world tasks validate the superiority of the proposed learning framework.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a general estimation methodology for learning a model of human perception and control in a sensorimotor control task based upon a finite set of demonstrations. The model's structure consists of i the agent's internal representation of how the environment and associated observations evolve as a result of control actions and ii the agent's preferences over observable outcomes. We consider a model's structure specification consistent with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent's current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical accuracy of the human agent's model of the environment. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset. Overall, the results indicate that learning active inference models of human perception and control from data is a promising alternative to black-box models of driving.

Abstract: We explore "omitted label contexts," in which training data is limited to a subset of the possible labels. This setting is standard among specialized human experts or specific, focused studies. By studying Simpson's paradox, we observe that ``correct'' adjustments sometimes require non-exchangeable treatment and control groups. A generalization of Simpson's paradox leads us to study networks of conclusions drawn from different contexts, within which a paradox of nontransitivity arises. We prove that the space of possible nontransitive structures in these networks exactly corresponds to structures that form from aggregating ranked-choice votes.

Abstract: Class-wise characteristics of training examples affect the performance of deep classifiers. A well-studied example is when the number of training examples of classes follows a long-tailed distribution, a situation that is likely to yield sub-optimal performance for under-represented classes. This class imbalance problem is conventionally addressed by approaches relying on the class-wise cardinality of training examples, such as data resampling. In this paper, we demonstrate that considering solely the cardinality of classes does not cover all issues causing class imbalance. To measure class imbalance, we propose "Class Uncertainty" as the average predictive uncertainty of the training examples, and we show that this novel measure captures the differences across classes better than cardinality. We also curate SVCI-20 as a novel dataset in which the classes have equal number of training examples but they differ in terms of their hardness; thereby causing a type of class imbalance which cannot be addressed by the approaches relying on cardinality. We incorporate our "Class Uncertainty" measure into a diverse set of ten class imbalance mitigation methods to demonstrate its effectiveness on long-tailed datasets as well as on our SVCI-20. Code and datasets will be made available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have shown promising performance on various tasks. However, due to the huge model sizes, running them in resource-constrained environments where the GPU memory is not abundant is challenging. Some existing systems propose to use CPU resources to solve that, but they either suffer from the significant overhead of frequently moving data between CPU and GPU, or fail to consider distinct characteristics of CPUs and GPUs. This paper proposes Fiddler, a resource-efficient inference system for MoE models with limited GPU resources. Fiddler strategically utilizes CPU and GPU resources by determining the optimal execution strategy. Our evaluation shows that, unlike state-of-the-art systems that optimize for specific scenarios such as single batch inference or long prefill, Fiddler performs better in all scenarios. Compared against different baselines, Fiddler achieves 1.26 times speed up in single batch inference, 1.30 times in long prefill processing, and 11.57 times in beam search inference. The code of Fiddler is publicly available at https://github.com/efeslab/fiddler.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification models have gained increasing attention in recent years as concerns grow on discrimination against some demographic groups. Most existing models require full knowledge of the sensitive features, which can be impractical due to privacy, legal issues, and an individual's fear of discrimination. The key challenge we will address is the group dependency of the unavailability, e.g., people of some age range may be more reluctant to reveal their age. Our solution augments general fairness risks with probabilistic imputations of the sensitive features, while jointly learning the group-conditionally missing probabilities in a variational auto-encoder. Our model is demonstrated effective on both image and tabular datasets, achieving an improved balance between accuracy and fairness.

Abstract: Nanosatellite constellations equipped with sensors capturing large geographic regions provide unprecedented opportunities for Earth observation. As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks. This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with competitive scores on quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.

Abstract: Conventional mechanical design follows an iterative process in which initial concepts are refined through cycles of expert assessment and resource-intensive Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis to meet performance goals. While machine learning models have been developed to assist in parts of this process, they typically require large datasets, extensive training, and are often tailored to specific tasks, limiting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that leverages a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM) in conjunction with an FEM module to autonomously generate, evaluate, and refine structural designs based on performance specifications and numerical feedback. The LLM operates without domain-specific fine-tuning, using general reasoning to propose design candidates, interpret FEM-derived performance metrics, and apply structurally sound modifications. Using 2D truss structures as a testbed, we show that the LLM can effectively navigate highly discrete and multi-faceted design spaces, balance competing objectives, and identify convergence when further optimization yields diminishing returns. Compared to Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), our method achieves faster convergence and fewer FEM evaluations. Experiments with varying temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 1.2) and model sizes (GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini) indicate that smaller models yield higher constraint satisfaction with fewer steps, while lower temperatures enhance design consistency. These results establish LLMs as a promising new class of reasoning-based, natural language-driven optimizers for autonomous design and iterative structural refinement.

Abstract: The diffusion bridge, which is a diffusion process conditioned on hitting a specific state within a finite period, has found broad applications in various scientific and engineering fields. However, simulating diffusion bridges for modeling natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain under explored. This paper presents a method that merges score matching techniques with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to learn the infinite-dimensional bridge and achieving a discretization equivariant bridge simulation. We conduct a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data. Our method demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution without extra training.

Abstract: Recently, a tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression model has been proposed to generalize tensor recovery, encompassing scenarios like scalar-on-tensor regression and tensor-on-vector regression. However, the exponential growth in tensor complexity poses challenges for storage and computation in ToT regression. To overcome this hurdle, tensor decompositions have been introduced, with the tensor train (TT)-based ToT model proving efficient in practice due to reduced memory requirements, enhanced computational efficiency, and decreased sampling complexity. Despite these practical benefits, a disparity exists between theoretical analysis and real-world performance. In this paper, we delve into the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the TT-based ToT regression model. Assuming the regression operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we conduct an error analysis for the solution to a constrained least-squares optimization problem. This analysis includes upper error bound and minimax lower bound, revealing that such error bounds polynomially depend on the order $N+M$. To efficiently find solutions meeting such error bounds, we propose two optimization algorithms: the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm (employing gradient descent with TT-singular value decomposition (TT-SVD)) and the factorization approach using the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) algorithm. When RIP is satisfied, spectral initialization facilitates proper initialization, and we establish the linear convergence rate of both IHT and RGD.

Abstract: Unsupervised graph alignment finds the node correspondence between a pair of attributed graphs by only exploiting graph structure and node features. One category of recent studies first computes the node representation and then matches nodes with the largest embedding-based similarity, while the other category reduces the problem to optimal transport (OT) via Gromov-Wasserstein learning. However, it remains largely unexplored in the model expressiveness, as well as how theoretical expressivity impacts prediction accuracy. We investigate the model expressiveness from two aspects. First, we characterize the model's discriminative power in distinguishing matched and unmatched node pairs across two graphs.Second, we study the model's capability of guaranteeing node matching properties such as one-to-one matching and mutual alignment. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we put forward a hybrid approach named CombAlign with stronger expressive power. Specifically, we enable cross-dimensional feature interaction for OT-based learning and propose an embedding-based method inspired by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. We also apply non-uniform marginals obtained from the embedding-based modules to OT as priors for more expressiveness. Based on that, we propose a traditional algorithm-based refinement, which combines our OT and embedding-based predictions using the ensemble learning strategy and reduces the problem to maximum weight matching. With carefully designed edge weights, we ensure those matching properties and further enhance prediction accuracy. By extensive experiments, we demonstrate a significant improvement of 14.5% in alignment accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches and confirm the soundness of our theoretical analysis.

Unlike standard GNNs that rely on shallow, fixed-hop aggregation, DRTR leverages both static preprocessing and dynamic resampling to capture deeper structural dependencies. A \emph{Distance Recomputator} prunes semantically weak edges using adaptive attention, while a \emph{Topology Reconstructor} establishes latent connections among distant but relevant nodes. This joint mechanism enables more expressive and robust representation learning across evolving graph structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRTR outperforms baseline GNNs in both accuracy and scalability, especially in complex and noisy graph environments.

Abstract: In traditional models of supervised learning, the goal of a learner -- given examples from an arbitrary joint distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d \times \{\pm 1\}$ -- is to output a hypothesis that is competitive (to within $\epsilon$) of the best fitting concept from some class. In order to escape strong hardness results for learning even simple concept classes, we introduce a smoothed-analysis framework that requires a learner to compete only with the best classifier that is robust to small random Gaussian perturbation.
  This subtle change allows us to give a wide array of learning results for any concept that (1) depends on a low-dimensional subspace (aka multi-index model) and (2) has a bounded Gaussian surface area. This class includes functions of halfspaces and (low-dimensional) convex sets, cases that are only known to be learnable in non-smoothed settings with respect to highly structured distributions such as Gaussians.
  Surprisingly, our analysis also yields new results for traditional non-smoothed frameworks such as learning with margin. In particular, we obtain the first algorithm for agnostically learning intersections of $k$-halfspaces in time $k^{poly(\frac{\log k}{\epsilon \gamma}) }$ where $\gamma$ is the margin parameter. Before our work, the best-known runtime was exponential in $k$ (Arriaga and Vempala, 1999).

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning from graph-structured data. However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarking datasets confirm the superiority of CGNN against 13 state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Background: AI-driven prediction algorithms have the potential to enhance emergency medicine by enabling rapid and accurate decision-making regarding patient status and potential deterioration. However, the integration of multimodal data, including raw waveform signals, remains underexplored in clinical decision support. Methods: We present a dataset and benchmarking protocol designed to advance multimodal decision support in emergency care. Our models utilize demographics, biometrics, vital signs, laboratory values, and electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms as inputs to predict both discharge diagnoses and patient deterioration. Results: The diagnostic model achieves area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) scores above 0.8 for 609 out of 1,428 conditions, covering both cardiac (e.g., myocardial infarction) and non-cardiac (e.g., renal disease, diabetes) diagnoses. The deterioration model attains AUROC scores above 0.8 for 14 out of 15 targets, accurately predicting critical events such as cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and mortality. Conclusions: Our study highlights the positive impact of incorporating raw waveform data into decision support models, improving predictive performance. By introducing a unique, publicly available dataset and baseline models, we provide a foundation for measurable progress in AI-driven decision support for emergency care.

<title>Reward-Augmented Data Enhances Direct Preference Alignment of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions. However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses, despite having access to preference data that includes reward scores from judge models during AI feedback. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to optimal responses that are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. The experiments across various benchmarks and diverse models demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts DPO by a considerable margin. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere data expansion. Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task that provides key information for decision-making. After traditional statistical and machine learning approaches, various fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs have been developed. However, the structural limitations caused by the inductive biases of each deep learning architecture constrained their performance. Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up new possibilities for using diverse architectures, ranging from fundamental deep learning models to emerging architectures and hybrid approaches. In this context, architectural modeling of time series forecasting has now entered a renaissance. This survey not only provides a historical context for time series forecasting but also offers comprehensive and timely analysis of the movement toward architectural diversification. By comparing and re-examining deep learning models, we uncover new perspectives and present recent trends, including hybrid, diffusion, Mamba, and foundation models. By focusing on the inherent characteristics of time series data, we also address open challenges that have gained attention in time series forecasting, such as channel dependency, distribution shift, causality, and feature extraction. These contributions help lower entry barriers for newcomers by providing a systematic understanding of the diverse research areas in time series forecasting (TSF), while offering seasoned researchers broader perspectives and new opportunities through in-depth exploration of TSF challenges.

Abstract: We consider the problem of finite-horizon sequential experimental design to solve multi-objective optimization (MOO) of expensive black-box objective functions. This problem arises in many real-world applications, including materials design, where we have a small resource budget to make and evaluate candidate materials in the lab. We solve this problem using the framework of Bayesian optimization (BO) and propose the first set of non-myopic methods for MOO problems. Prior work on non-myopic BO for single-objective problems relies on the Bellman optimality principle to handle the lookahead reasoning process. However, this principle does not hold for most MOO problems because the reward function needs to satisfy some conditions: scalar variable, monotonicity, and additivity. We address this challenge by using hypervolume improvement (HVI) as our scalarization approach, which allows us to use a lower-bound on the Bellman equation to approximate the finite-horizon using a batch expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) acquisition function (AF) for MOO. Our formulation naturally allows us to use other improvement-based scalarizations and compare their efficacy to HVI. We derive three non-myopic AFs for MOBO: 1) the Nested AF, which is based on the exact computation of the lower bound, 2) the Joint AF, which is a lower bound on the nested AF, and 3) the BINOM AF, which is a fast and approximate variant based on batch multi-objective acquisition functions. Our experiments on multiple diverse real-world MO problems demonstrate that our non-myopic AFs substantially improve performance over the existing myopic AFs for MOBO.

Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly employed for perception, prediction, and control in robotic systems. For for achieving realistic and consistent outputs, it is crucial to embed physical knowledge into their learned representations. However, doing so is difficult due to high-dimensional observation data, such as images, particularly under conditions of incomplete system knowledge and imprecise state sensing. To address this, we propose Physically Interpretable World Models, a novel architecture that aligns learned latent representations with real-world physical quantities. To this end, our architecture combines three key elements: (1) a vector-quantized image autoencoder, (2) a transformer-based physically interpretable autoencoder, and (3) a partially known dynamical model. The training incorporates weak interval-based supervision to eliminate the impractical reliance on ground-truth physical knowledge. Three case studies demonstrate that our approach achieves physical interpretability and accurate state predictions, thus advancing representation learning for robotics.

Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Residual Integral Solver Network (RISN), a novel neural network architecture designed to solve a wide range of integral and integro-differential equations, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, ordinary and partial integro-differential, systems, fractional types, and Helmholtz-type integral equations involving oscillatory kernels. RISN integrates residual connections with high-accuracy numerical methods such as Gaussian quadrature and fractional derivative operational matrices, enabling it to achieve higher accuracy and stability than traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). The residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradient issues, allowing RISN to handle deeper networks and more complex kernels, particularly in multi-dimensional problems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RISN consistently outperforms not only classical PINNs but also advanced variants such as Auxiliary PINN (A-PINN) and Self-Adaptive PINN (SA-PINN), achieving significantly lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) across various types of equations. These results highlight RISN's robustness and efficiency in solving challenging integral and integro-differential problems, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications where traditional methods often struggle.

Abstract: This paper introduces innovative enhancements to the K-means and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms based on the concept of Gini prametric spaces. Unlike traditional distance metrics, Gini-based measures incorporate both value-based and rank-based information, improving robustness to noise and outliers. The main contributions of this work include: proposing a Gini-based measure that captures both rank information and value distances; presenting a Gini K-means algorithm that is proven to converge and demonstrates resilience to noisy data; and introducing a Gini KNN method that performs competitively with state-of-the-art approaches such as Hassanat's distance in noisy environments. Experimental evaluations on 14 datasets from the UCI repository demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of Gini-based algorithms in clustering and classification tasks. This work opens new avenues for leveraging rank-based measures in machine learning and statistical analysis.

Abstract: The goal of offline model-based optimization (MBO) is to propose new designs that maximize a reward function given only an offline dataset. However, an important desiderata is to also propose a diverse set of final candidates that capture many optimal and near-optimal design configurations. We propose Diversity in Adversarial Model-based Optimization (DynAMO) as a novel method to introduce design diversity as an explicit objective into any MBO problem. Our key insight is to formulate diversity as a distribution matching problem where the distribution of generated designs captures the inherent diversity contained within the offline dataset. Extensive experiments spanning multiple scientific domains show that DynAMO can be used with common optimization methods to significantly improve the diversity of proposed designs while still discovering high-quality candidates.

Abstract: Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.

Abstract: Recent work by Foster et al. (2021, 2022, 2023b) and Xu and Zeevi (2023) developed the framework of decision estimation coefficient (DEC) that characterizes the complexity of general online decision making problems and provides a general algorithm design principle. These works, however, either focus on the pure stochastic regime where the world remains fixed over time, or the pure adversarial regime where the world arbitrarily changes over time. For the hybrid regime where the dynamics of the world is fixed while the reward arbitrarily changes, they only give pessimistic bounds on the decision complexity. In this work, we propose a general extension of DEC that more precisely characterizes this case. Besides applications in special cases, our framework leads to a flexible algorithm design where the learner learns over subsets of the hypothesis set, trading estimation complexity with decision complexity, which could be of independent interest. Our work covers model-based learning and model-free learning in the hybrid regime, with a newly proposed extension of the bilinear classes (Du et al., 2021) to the adversarial-reward case. In addition, our method improves the best-known regret bounds for linear Q*/V* MDPs in the pure stochastic regime.

Abstract: The burgeoning volume of electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled deep learning models to excel in predictive healthcare. However, for high-stakes applications such as diagnosis prediction, model interpretability remains paramount. Existing deep learning diagnosis prediction models with intrinsic interpretability often assign attention weights to every past diagnosis or hospital visit, providing explanations lacking flexibility and succinctness. In this paper, we introduce SHy, a self-explaining hypergraph neural network model, designed to offer personalized, concise and faithful explanations that allow for interventions from clinical experts. By modeling each patient as a unique hypergraph and employing a message-passing mechanism, SHy captures higher-order disease interactions and extracts distinct temporal phenotypes as personalized explanations. It also addresses the incompleteness of the EHR data by accounting for essential false negatives in the original diagnosis record. A qualitative case study and extensive quantitative evaluations on two real-world EHR datasets demonstrate the superior predictive performance and interpretability of SHy over existing state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, where users can request the deletion of a forget dataset, is becoming increasingly important because of numerous privacy regulations. Initial works on ``exact'' unlearning (e.g., retraining) incur large computational overheads. However, while computationally inexpensive, ``approximate'' methods have fallen short of reaching the effectiveness of exact unlearning: models produced fail to obtain comparable accuracy and prediction confidence on both the forget and test (i.e., unseen) dataset. Exploiting this observation, we propose a new unlearning method, Adversarial Machine UNlearning (AMUN), that outperforms prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for image classification. AMUN lowers the confidence of the model on the forget samples by fine-tuning the model on their corresponding adversarial examples. Adversarial examples naturally belong to the distribution imposed by the model on the input space; fine-tuning the model on the adversarial examples closest to the corresponding forget samples (a) localizes the changes to the decision boundary of the model around each forget sample and (b) avoids drastic changes to the global behavior of the model, thereby preserving the model's accuracy on test samples. Using AMUN for unlearning a random $10\%$ of CIFAR-10 samples, we observe that even SOTA membership inference attacks cannot do better than random guessing.

Abstract: Land cover classification involves the production of land cover maps, which determine the type of land through remote sensing imagery. Over recent years, such classification is being performed by machine learning classification models, which can give highly accurate predictions on land cover per pixel using large quantities of input training data. However, such models do not currently take account of input measurement uncertainty, which is vital for traceability in metrology. In this work we propose a Bayesian classification framework using generative modelling to take account of input measurement uncertainty. We take the specific case of Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis, and apply it to land cover datasets from Copernicus Sentinel-2 in 2020 and 2021. We benchmark the performance of the model against more popular classification models used in land cover maps such as random forests and neural networks. We find that such Bayesian models are more trustworthy, in the sense that they are more interpretable, explicitly model the input measurement uncertainty, and maintain predictive performance of class probability outputs across datasets of different years and sizes, whilst also being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models without extensive reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this work, we revisit the traditional Policy Gradient (PG) mechanism and propose a minimalist RL approach termed Group Policy Gradient (GPG). Unlike conventional methods, GPG directly optimize the original RL objective, thus obviating the need for surrogate loss functions. By eliminating the critic and reference models, avoiding KL divergence constraints, and addressing the advantage and gradient estimation bias, our approach significantly simplifies the training process compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach achieves superior performance without relying on auxiliary techniques or adjustments. As illustrated in Figure 1, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational costs but also consistently outperforms GRPO across various unimodal and multimodal tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/GPG.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) classification models are increasingly being used in a wide range of applications where it is important that predictions are accompanied by uncertainties, including in climate and earth observation, medical diagnosis and bioaerosol monitoring. The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for ML classification, and illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the VIM and GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models.

Abstract: We present Variational Self-Supervised Learning (VSSL), a novel framework that combines variational inference with self-supervised learning to enable efficient, decoder-free representation learning. Unlike traditional VAEs that rely on input reconstruction via a decoder, VSSL symmetrically couples two encoders with Gaussian outputs. A momentum-updated teacher network defines a dynamic, data-dependent prior, while the student encoder produces an approximate posterior from augmented views. The reconstruction term in the ELBO is replaced with a cross-view denoising objective, preserving the analytical tractability of Gaussian KL divergence. We further introduce cosine-based formulations of KL and log-likelihood terms to enhance semantic alignment in high-dimensional latent spaces. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 show that VSSL achieves competitive or superior performance to leading self-supervised methods, including BYOL and MoCo V3. VSSL offers a scalable, probabilistically grounded approach to learning transferable representations without generative reconstruction, bridging the gap between variational modeling and modern self-supervised techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been the predominant generative model for tabular data generation. However, they face the conundrum of modeling under a separate versus a unified data representation. The former encounters the challenge of jointly modeling all multi-modal distributions of tabular data in one model. While the latter alleviates this by learning a single representation for all features, it currently leverages sparse suboptimal encoding heuristics and necessitates additional computation costs. In this work, we address the latter by presenting TabRep, a tabular diffusion architecture trained with a unified continuous representation. To motivate the design of our representation, we provide geometric insights into how the data manifold affects diffusion models. The key attributes of our representation are composed of its density, flexibility to provide ample separability for nominal features, and ability to preserve intrinsic relationships. Ultimately, TabRep provides a simple yet effective approach for training tabular diffusion models under a continuous data manifold. Our results showcase that TabRep achieves superior performance across a broad suite of evaluations. It is the first to synthesize tabular data that exceeds the downstream quality of the original datasets while preserving privacy and remaining computationally efficient.

Abstract: Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has shown great potential for enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it is often sample- and compute-inefficient, requiring extensive training. In this work, we introduce AdaRFT (Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Finetuning), a method that significantly improves both the efficiency and final accuracy of RFT through adaptive curriculum learning. AdaRFT dynamically adjusts the difficulty of training problems based on the model's recent reward signals, ensuring that the model consistently trains on tasks that are challenging but solvable. This adaptive sampling strategy accelerates learning by maintaining an optimal difficulty range, avoiding wasted computation on problems that are too easy or too hard. AdaRFT requires only a lightweight extension to standard RFT algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), without modifying the reward function or model architecture. Experiments on competition-level math datasets-including AMC, AIME, and IMO-style problems-demonstrate that AdaRFT significantly improves both training efficiency and reasoning performance. We evaluate AdaRFT across multiple data distributions and model sizes, showing that it reduces training time by up to 2x and improves accuracy by a considerable margin, offering a more scalable and effective RFT framework.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.
  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows. Software and experimental code are publicly available at https://github.com/inEXASCALE/pychop.

Abstract: Hopfield networks using Hebbian learning suffer from limited storage capacity. While supervised methods like Linear Logistic Regression (LLR) offer some improvement, kernel methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) significantly enhance capacity and noise robustness. However, KLR requires computationally expensive iterative learning. We propose Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) as an efficient kernel-based alternative for learning high-capacity Hopfield networks. KRR utilizes the kernel trick and predicts bipolar states via regression, crucially offering a non-iterative, closed-form solution for learning dual variables. We evaluate KRR and compare its performance against Hebbian, LLR, and KLR. Our results demonstrate that KRR achieves state-of-the-art storage capacity (reaching $\beta$=1.5) and noise robustness, comparable to KLR. Crucially, KRR drastically reduces training time, being orders of magnitude faster than LLR and significantly faster than KLR, especially at higher storage loads. This establishes KRR as a potent and highly efficient method for building high-performance associative memories, providing comparable performance to KLR with substantial training speed advantages. This work provides the first empirical comparison between KRR and KLR in the context of Hopfield network learning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning simulation-trained RL agents with real-world data often degrades crucial behaviors due to limited or skewed data distributions. We argue that designer priorities exist not just in reward functions, but also in simulation design choices like task selection and state initialization. When adapting to real-world data, agents can experience catastrophic forgetting in important but underrepresented scenarios. We propose framing live-adaptation as a multi-objective optimization problem, where policy objectives must be satisfied both in simulation and reality. Our approach leverages critics from simulation as "anchors for design intent" (anchor critics). By jointly optimizing policies against both anchor critics and critics trained on real-world experience, our method enables adaptation while preserving prioritized behaviors from simulation. Evaluations demonstrate robust behavior retention in sim-to-sim benchmarks and a sim-to-real scenario with a racing quadrotor, allowing for power consumption reductions of up to 50% without control loss. We also contribute SwaNNFlight, an open-source firmware for enabling live adaptation on similar robotic platforms.

Abstract: We exploit analogies between first-order algorithms for constrained optimization and non-smooth dynamical systems to design a new class of accelerated first-order algorithms for constrained optimization. Unlike Frank-Wolfe or projected gradients, these algorithms avoid optimization over the entire feasible set at each iteration. We prove convergence to stationary points even in a nonconvex setting and we derive accelerated rates for the convex setting both in continuous time, as well as in discrete time. An important property of these algorithms is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities instead of positions, which naturally leads to sparse, local and convex approximations of the feasible set (even if the feasible set is nonconvex). Thus, the complexity tends to grow mildly in the number of decision variables and in the number of constraints, which makes the algorithms suitable for machine learning applications. We apply our algorithms to a compressed sensing and a sparse regression problem, showing that we can treat nonconvex $\ell^p$ constraints ($p<1$) efficiently, while recovering state-of-the-art performance for $p=1$.

Abstract: This paper studies a class of convex Finite-sum Coupled Compositional Optimization (cFCCO) problems with applications including group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) and learning with imbalanced data. To better address these problems, we introduce an efficient single-loop primal-dual block-coordinate stochastic algorithm called ALEXR. The algorithm employs block-coordinate stochastic mirror ascent with extrapolation for the dual variable and stochastic proximal gradient descent updates for the primal variable. We establish the convergence rates of ALEXR in both convex and strongly convex cases under smoothness and non-smoothness conditions of involved functions, which not only improve the best rates in previous works on smooth cFCCO problems but also expand the realm of cFCCO for solving more challenging non-smooth problems such as the dual form of GDRO. Finally, we derive lower complexity bounds, demonstrating the (near-)optimality of ALEXR within a broad class of stochastic algorithms for cFCCO. Experimental results on GDRO and partial Area Under the ROC Curve (pAUC) maximization demonstrate the promising performance of our algorithm.

<title>QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM Serving</title>

arXiv:2405.04532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

arXiv:2405.04620v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.

<title>A Machine Learning-Based Framework for Assessing Cryptographic Indistinguishability of Lightweight Block Ciphers</title>

Abstract: Indistinguishability is a fundamental principle of cryptographic security, crucial for securing data transmitted between Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This principle ensures that an attacker cannot distinguish between the encrypted data, also known as ciphertext, and random data or the ciphertexts of the two messages encrypted with the same key. This research investigates the ability of machine learning (ML) in assessing indistinguishability property in encryption systems, with a focus on lightweight ciphers. As our first case study, we consider the SPECK32/64 and SIMON32/64 lightweight block ciphers, designed for IoT devices operating under significant energy constraints.
  In this research, we introduce MIND-Crypt, a novel ML-based framework designed to assess the cryptographic indistinguishability of lightweight block ciphers, specifically the SPECK32/64 and SIMON32/64 encryption algorithm in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining), under Known Plaintext Attacks (KPA). Our approach involves training ML models using ciphertexts from two plaintext messages encrypted with same key to determine whether ML algorithms can identify meaningful cryptographic patterns or leakage. Our experiments show that modern ML techniques consistently achieve accuracy equivalent to random guessing, indicating that no statistically exploitable patterns exists in the ciphertexts generated by considered lightweight block ciphers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in ML algorithms with all the possible combinations of the ciphertexts for given plaintext messages reflects memorization rather than generalization to unseen ciphertexts.
  Collectively, these findings suggest that existing block ciphers have secure cryptographic designs against ML-based indistinguishability assessments, reinforcing their security even under round-reduced conditions.

Abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects such as conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) and conditional quantile treatment effects (CQTEs) play an important role in real-world decision making. Given this importance, one should ensure these estimates are calibrated. While there is a rich literature on calibrating estimators of non-causal parameters, very few methods have been derived for calibrating estimators of causal parameters, or more generally estimators of quantities involving nuisance parameters. In this work, we develop general algorithms for reducing the task of causal calibration to that of calibrating a standard (non-causal) predictive model.
  Throughout, we study a notion of calibration defined with respect to an arbitrary, nuisance-dependent loss $\ell$, under which we say an estimator $\theta$ is calibrated if its predictions cannot be changed on any level set to decrease loss. For losses $\ell$ satisfying a condition called universal orthogonality, we present a simple algorithm that transforms partially-observed data into generalized pseudo-outcomes and applies any off-the-shelf calibration procedure. For losses $\ell$ satisfying a weaker assumption called conditional orthogonality, we provide a similar sample splitting algorithm the performs empirical risk minimization over an appropriately defined class of functions. Convergence of both algorithms follows from a generic, two term upper bound of the calibration error of any model. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our results in experiments on both observational and synthetic data. Our results are exceedingly general, showing that essentially any existing calibration algorithm can be used in causal settings, with additional loss only arising from errors in nuisance estimation.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into healthcare systems holds great promise for enhancing patient care and care delivery efficiency; however, it also exposes sensitive data and system integrity to potential cyberattacks. Current security and privacy (S&amp;P) research on healthcare AI is highly unbalanced in terms of healthcare deployment scenarios and threat models, and has a disconnected focus with the biomedical research community. This hinders a comprehensive understanding of the risks that healthcare AI entails. To address this gap, this paper takes a thorough examination of existing healthcare AI S&amp;P research, providing a unified framework that allows the identification of under-explored areas. Our survey presents a systematic overview of healthcare AI attacks and defenses, and points out challenges and research opportunities for each AI-driven healthcare application domain. Through our experimental analysis of different threat models and feasibility studies on under-explored adversarial attacks, we provide compelling insights into the pressing need for cybersecurity research in the rapidly evolving field of healthcare AI.

Abstract: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.

Abstract: Toxicity text detectors can be vulnerable to adversarial examples - small perturbations to input text that fool the systems into wrong detection. Existing attack algorithms are time-consuming and often produce invalid or ambiguous adversarial examples, making them less useful for evaluating or improving real-world toxicity content moderators. This paper proposes an annotation pipeline for quality control of generated toxic adversarial examples (TAE). We design model-based automated annotation and human-based quality verification to assess the quality requirements of TAE. Successful TAE should fool a target toxicity model into making benign predictions, be grammatically reasonable, appear natural like human-generated text, and exhibit semantic toxicity. When applying these requirements to more than 20 state-of-the-art (SOTA) TAE attack recipes, we find many invalid samples from a total of 940k raw TAE attack generations. We then utilize the proposed pipeline to filter and curate a high-quality TAE dataset we call TaeBench (of size 264k). Empirically, we demonstrate that TaeBench can effectively transfer-attack SOTA toxicity content moderation models and services. Our experiments also show that TaeBench with adversarial training achieve significant improvements of the robustness of two toxicity detectors.

Abstract: Integer linear programming (ILP) is an elegant approach to solve linear optimization problems, naturally described using integer decision variables. Within the context of physics-inspired machine learning applied to chemistry, we demonstrate the relevance of an ILP formulation to select molecular training sets for predictions of size-extensive properties. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing unsupervised training set selection approaches, especially when predicting properties of molecules larger than those present in the training set. We argue that the reason for the improved performance is due to the selection that is based on the notion of local similarity (i.e., per-atom) and a unique ILP approach that finds optimal solutions efficiently. Altogether, this work provides a practical algorithm to improve the performance of physics-inspired machine learning models and offers insights into the conceptual differences with existing training set selection approaches.

Abstract: Rooted in the explosion of deep learning over the past decade, this thesis spans from AlphaGo to ChatGPT to empirically examine the fundamental concepts needed to realize the vision of an artificial scientist: a machine with the capacity to autonomously generate original research and contribute to the expansion of human knowledge. The investigation begins with Olivaw, an AlphaGo Zero-like agent that discovers Othello knowledge from scratch but is unable to communicate it. This realization leads to the development of the Explanatory Learning (EL) framework, a formalization of the problem faced by a scientist when trying to explain a new phenomenon to their peers. The effective EL prescriptions allow us to crack Zendo, a popular board game simulating the scientific endeavor. This success comes with a fundamental insight: an artificial scientist must develop its own interpretation of the language used to explain its findings, and not rely on a rigid existing interpreter. Questioning the very process of learning an interpreter, we turn our attention to the inner functioning of modern multimodal models. This culminates in a simple idea to build CLIP-like models where interpretation and perception are explicitly disentangled: a cost-effective approach that couples two unimodal models using little multimodal data and no further training. Finally, we discuss what ChatGPT and its siblings are still missing to become artificial scientists, and introduce the Big-Bench Symbol Interpretation Task, a benchmark about interpreting Zendo-like explanations that sees LLMs going no further than random chance while being instead fully solved by humans.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles, necessitating a revolutionary architecture to support the growing demands for computational power. Cloud computing has become the driving force behind this transformation. However, it consumes significant power and faces computation security risks due to the reliance on extensive data centers and servers in the cloud. Reducing power consumption while enhancing computational scale remains persistent challenges in cloud computing. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical cloud computing system that can be seamlessly deployed across edge-metro network. By modulating inputs and models into light, a wide range of edge nodes can directly access the optical computing center via the edge-metro network. The experimental validations show an energy efficiency of 118.6 mW/TOPs (tera operations per second), reducing energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional electronic-based cloud computing solutions. Furthermore, it is experimentally validated that this architecture can perform various complex generative AI models through parallel computing to achieve image generation tasks.

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios. Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA). However, this approach incurs substantial human costs. Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners. First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios. Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model translates into scripts using in-context learning. The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios. As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners. To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both. Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.

<title>Generalizing Safety Beyond Collision-Avoidance via Latent-Space Reachability Analysis</title>

Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a rigorous mathematical framework that enables robots to simultaneously detect unsafe states and generate actions that prevent future failures. While in theory, HJ reachability can synthesize safe controllers for nonlinear systems and nonconvex constraints, in practice, it has been limited to hand-engineered collision-avoidance constraints modeled via low-dimensional state-space representations and first-principles dynamics. In this work, our goal is to generalize safe robot controllers to prevent failures that are hard--if not impossible--to write down by hand, but can be intuitively identified from high-dimensional observations: for example, spilling the contents of a bag. We propose Latent Safety Filters, a latent-space generalization of HJ reachability that tractably operates directly on raw observation data (e.g., RGB images) to automatically compute safety-preserving actions without explicit recovery demonstrations by performing safety analysis in the latent embedding space of a generative world model. Our method leverages diverse robot observation-action data of varying quality (including successes, random exploration, and unsafe demonstrations) to learn a world model. Constraint specification is then transformed into a classification problem in the latent space of the learned world model. In simulation and hardware experiments, we compute an approximation of Latent Safety Filters to safeguard arbitrary policies (from imitation- learned policies to direct teleoperation) from complex safety hazards, like preventing a Franka Research 3 manipulator from spilling the contents of a bag or toppling cluttered objects.

Abstract: Existing information retrieval systems are largely constrained by their reliance on vector inner products to assess query-document relevance, which naturally limits the expressiveness of the relevance score they can produce. We propose a new paradigm; instead of representing a query as a vector, we use a small neural network that acts as a learned query-specific relevance function. This small neural network takes a document representation as input (in this work we use a single vector) and produces a scalar relevance score. To produce the small neural network we use a hypernetwork, a network that produces the weights of other networks, as our query encoder. We name this category of encoder models Hypencoders. Experiments on in-domain search tasks show that Hypencoders significantly outperform strong dense retrieval models and even surpass reranking models and retrieval models with an order of magnitude more parameters. To assess the extent of Hypencoders' capabilities, we evaluate on a set of hard retrieval tasks including tip-of-the-tongue and instruction-following retrieval tasks. On harder tasks, we find that the performance gap widens substantially compared to standard retrieval tasks. Furthermore, to demonstrate the practicality of our method, we implement an approximate search algorithm and show that our model is able to retrieve from a corpus of 8.8M documents in under 60 milliseconds.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence seamlessly integrates vision, language, and action.~However, most multimodal robotic models rely on massive fine-tuning, incurring high time and hardware costs.~To address this, we introduce RoboBERT, an end-to-end multimodal manipulation model built around a novel two-stage training paradigm.~In the first stage, we freeze most of the vision encoder and train with a single "standard" instruction phrasing, allowing the model to focus on stable policy learning via a CNN-based diffusion policy.~In the second stage, we unfreeze all modules and inject diverse natural language variants, rapidly aligning varied instructions to the already-learned policy without destabilizing performance.~We further employ systematic data augmentations to enhance robustness against visual perturbations.~Without relying on auxiliary datasets, RoboBERT achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) mean episode lengths of 4.52 on the CALVIN ABCD-D benchmark and 3.79 on the ABC-D benchmark using only language-labeled expert demonstrations and a comparatively lightweight architecture.Real-robot trials on a 6-DOF manipulator confirm higher success rates than comparable methods trained on identical data.These results demonstrate that our data-augmentation-enhanced two-stage training paradigm delivers efficient, scalable, and broadly applicable performance for multimodal robotic systems.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of biological systems is fundamental to deciphering cellular behavior, developmental processes, and disease progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided static snapshots of gene expression, offering valuable insights into cellular states at a single time point. Recent advancements in temporally resolved scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and time-series spatial transcriptomics (temporal-ST) have further revolutionized our ability to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual cells. These technologies, when combined with computational frameworks such as Markov chains, stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and generative models like optimal transport and Schr\"odinger bridges, enable the reconstruction of dynamic cellular trajectories and cell fate decisions. This review discusses how these dynamical system approaches offer new opportunities to model and infer cellular dynamics from a systematic perspective.

<div> Keywords: Deep learning, GPU optimization, Matrix multiplication, Hexcute, Task mapping

Summary:<br /><br />Deep learning workloads often run on GPUs, and new quantization techniques require specialized matrix multiplication operators with mixed data types. Existing compilers like Triton struggle to optimize these operators effectively, while low-level programming models are labor-intensive to use. To address this gap, Hexcute is introduced as a tile-based programming language that enables fine-grained optimization for these complex operators. Hexcute exposes shared memory and register abstractions and leverages task mapping to schedule GPU programs efficiently. It also automates layout and task mapping synthesis using a novel algorithm based on type inference. Evaluation results demonstrate that Hexcute performs exceptionally well, achieving significant speedups compared to existing compilers for mixed-type operators and delivering notable improvements in overall performance. <div>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) workloads mainly run on accelerators like GPUs. Recent DL quantization techniques demand a new matrix multiplication operator with mixed input data types, further complicating GPU optimization. Prior high-level compilers like Triton lack the expressiveness to implement key optimizations like fine-grained data pipelines and hardware-friendly memory layouts for these operators, while low-level programming models, such as Hidet, Graphene, and CUTLASS, require significant programming efforts. To balance expressiveness with engineering effort, we propose Hexcute, a tile-based programming language that exposes shared memory and register abstractions to enable fine-grained optimization for these operators. Additionally, Hexcute leverages task mapping to schedule the GPU program, and to reduce programming efforts, it automates layout and task mapping synthesis with a novel type-inference-based algorithm. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute generalizes to a wide range of DL operators, achieves 1.7-11.28$\times$ speedup over existing DL compilers for mixed-type operators, and brings up to 2.91$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end evaluation.

<div> Transformers, compositional reasoning, generalization ability, few-shot learning, causal graph <br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces a learning task called FTCT to test Transformers' ability to integrate knowledge fragments. It demonstrates that Transformers can perform compositional reasoning by connecting fragments from separate sources to deduce relationships. The model successfully infers complete causal graph traces during testing, even when such combinations were not present in the training data. The research highlights the importance of few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting in enabling Transformers to showcase their compositional reasoning skills. It is noted that the model's ability to perform compositional reasoning is linked to its complexity and the similarity between training and testing data. The study suggests that Transformers learn a generalizable program during training, allowing them to effectively reason compositionally during testing. <div>
arXiv:2501.15857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable compositional reasoning by integrating knowledge from various sources. For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, "FTCT" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.

<div> Evolution, learning, neural networks, language, connectome
Summary:
This study introduces a novel framework for artificial neural networks that incorporates both evolution and individual learning processes. By incorporating an "outer loop" of evolution that shapes the "inner loop" of learning, artificial networks can better simulate the effects of both processes observed in biological organisms. The researchers trained a model in language tasks that inherited a "model connectome" from the evolutionary loop before exposure to a large dataset. Results showed that the connectome model outperformed or matched closely related control models on natural language processing tasks, human behavior alignment, and brain data alignment. This suggests that using a model connectome as a prior for learning can improve performance in low-data situations, bridging the gap between single-generation artificial models and biologically evolved neural networks. <div>
arXiv:2504.21047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological neural networks are shaped both by evolution across generations and by individual learning within an organism's lifetime, whereas standard artificial neural networks undergo a single, large training procedure without inherited constraints. In this preliminary work, we propose a framework that incorporates this crucial generational dimension - an "outer loop" of evolution that shapes the "inner loop" of learning - so that artificial networks better mirror the effects of evolution and individual learning in biological organisms. Focusing on language, we train a model that inherits a "model connectome" from the outer evolution loop before exposing it to a developmental-scale corpus of 100M tokens. Compared with two closely matched control models, we show that the connectome model performs better or on par on natural language processing tasks as well as alignment to human behavior and brain data. These findings suggest that a model connectome serves as an efficient prior for learning in low-data regimes - narrowing the gap between single-generation artificial models and biologically evolved neural networks.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a new method for inducing disalignment in large language models (LLMs) by identifying and modifying neurons that regulate safety constraints. The proposed approach involves three main steps: analyzing neuron activations to detect critical ones for distinguishing harmful and harmless inputs, identifying responsible neurons based on similarity, and fine-tuning these neurons to remove safety constraints. Experimental results show that the method effectively removes safety constraints with minimal adjustments, revealing a vulnerability in current alignment techniques. The study emphasizes the importance of developing robust defenses against adversarial fine-tuning attacks on LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is achieved through fine-tuning mechanisms that regulate neuron activations to suppress harmful content. In this work, we propose a novel approach to induce disalignment by identifying and modifying the neurons responsible for safety constraints. Our method consists of three key steps: Neuron Activation Analysis, where we examine activation patterns in response to harmful and harmless prompts to detect neurons that are critical for distinguishing between harmful and harmless inputs; Similarity-Based Neuron Identification, which systematically locates the neurons responsible for safe alignment; and Neuron Relearning for Safety Removal, where we fine-tune these selected neurons to restore the model's ability to generate previously restricted responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively removes safety constraints with minimal fine-tuning, highlighting a critical vulnerability in current alignment techniques. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against adversarial fine-tuning attacks on LLMs.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula to model the relationship between end-to-end measurement and SNR for deep learning based semantic encoders and decoders. The ABG formula is applicable for image reconstruction and inference tasks, fitting commonly used DL networks like SCUNet and Vision Transformer. It shows that the upper bound of MS-SSIM for image reconstruction depends on the quantized output bits of semantic encoders, with a proposed closed-form expression to describe this relationship. An adaptive power control scheme for semantic communications over fading channels is investigated, ensuring QoS and optimizing energy efficiency. The paper also presents an optimal power allocation scheme for maximizing energy efficiency in the semantic communication system, and a bisection algorithm based power allocation scheme to enhance QoS for multiple users in OFDMA downlink semantic communication. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ABG formula and power allocation schemes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Due to the black-box characteristics of deep learning based semantic encoders and decoders, finding a tractable method for the performance analysis of semantic communications is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula to model the relationship between the end-to-end measurement and SNR, which can be applied for both image reconstruction tasks and inference tasks. Specifically, for image reconstruction tasks, the proposed ABG formula can well fit the commonly used DL networks, such as SCUNet, and Vision Transformer, for semantic encoding with the multi scale-structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) measurement. Furthermore, we find that the upper bound of the MS-SSIM depends on the number of quantized output bits of semantic encoders, and we also propose a closed-form expression to fit the relationship between the MS-SSIM and quantized output bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical expression between end-to-end performance metrics and SNR for semantic communications. Based on the proposed ABG formula, we investigate an adaptive power control scheme for semantic communications over random fading channels, which can effectively guarantee quality of service (QoS) for semantic communications, and then design the optimal power allocation scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the semantic communication system. Furthermore, by exploiting the bisection algorithm, we develop the power allocation scheme to maximize the minimum QoS of multiple users for OFDMA downlink semantic communication Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ABG formula and power allocation schemes.

Summary:
The article introduces the Hamiltonian Higher Order Elasticity Dynamics (2HOED) framework, which combines machine learning, block chain technology, and causal inference to analyze complex systems. 2HOED represents systems as energy-based Hamiltonians, incorporating variables such as position, velocity, acceleration, and elasticity. This framework is versatile and can be applied to various disciplines, from financial markets to epidemiology. By embedding econometric variables in a Hamiltonian, 2HOED enhances economic analysis by revealing resilience, tipping points, and feedback loops. The method offers insights into system behavior, enabling decision-makers to anticipate crises and design adaptive policies. Utilizing wavelet spectra, phase space attractors, and topological persistence diagrams, 2HOED uncovers multistage policy leverage for proactive decision-making. This approach bridges the gap between biological or mechanical elasticity and macro-level outcomes, providing a new causal energetic channel for understanding complex systems. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning detects patterns, block chain guarantees trust and immutability, and modern causal inference identifies directional linkages, yet none alone exposes the full energetic anatomy of complex systems; the Hamiltonian Higher Order Elasticity Dynamics(2HOED) framework bridges these gaps. Grounded in classical mechanics but extended to Economics order elasticity terms, 2HOED represents economic, social, and physical systems as energy-based Hamiltonians whose position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk of elasticity jointly determine systemic power, Inertia, policy sensitivity, and marginal responses. Because the formalism is scaling free and coordinate agnostic, it transfers seamlessly from financial markets to climate science, from supply chain logistics to epidemiology, thus any discipline in which adaptation and shocks coexist. By embedding standard econometric variables inside a Hamiltonian, 2HOED enriches conventional economic analysis with rigorous diagnostics of resilience, tipping points, and feedback loops, revealing failure modes invisible to linear models. Wavelet spectra, phase space attractors, and topological persistence diagrams derived from 2HOED expose multistage policy leverage that machine learning detects only empirically and block chain secures only after the fact. For economists, physicians and other scientists, the method opens a new causal energetic channel linking biological or mechanical elasticity to macro level outcomes. Portable, interpretable, and computationally light, 2HOED turns data streams into dynamical energy maps, empowering decision makers to anticipate crises, design adaptive policies, and engineer robust systems delivering the predictive punch of AI with the explanatory clarity of physics.

<div> Keywords: Federated Domain Generalization, Prompt Learning, Mixture of Experts, Token-level Prompt, Parameter-free Routing

Summary: 

TRIP is a framework for Federated Domain Generalization that leverages token-level prompt mixture with parameter-free routing. It addresses the limitations of existing models by assigning different tokens within an image to specific prompt experts, improving specialization. The framework ensures communication efficiency by utilizing token clustering and optimal transport for routing. TRIP synthesizes an instance-specific prompt by aggregating experts based on the number of tokens assigned to each. It also introduces an unbiased learning strategy for prompt experts, harnessing the VLM's zero-shot generalization capability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate TRIP's effectiveness in achieving optimal generalization results while only requiring communication of 1K parameters per round. The code for TRIP is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to learn a globally generalizable model from decentralized clients with heterogeneous data while preserving privacy. Recent studies have introduced prompt learning to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) in FedDG by learning a single global prompt. However, such a one-prompt-fits-all learning paradigm typically leads to performance degradation on personalized samples. Although the mixture of experts (MoE) offers a promising solution for specialization, existing MoE-based methods suffer from coarse image-level expert assignment and high communication costs from parameterized routers. To address these limitations, we propose TRIP, a Token-level prompt mixture with parameter-free routing framework for FedDG, which treats multiple prompts as distinct experts. Unlike existing image-level routing designs, TRIP assigns different tokens within an image to specific experts. To ensure communication efficiency, TRIP incorporates a parameter-free routing mechanism based on token clustering and optimal transport. The instance-specific prompt is then synthesized by aggregating experts, weighted by the number of tokens assigned to each. Additionally, TRIP develops an unbiased learning strategy for prompt experts, leveraging the VLM's zero-shot generalization capability. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that TRIP achieves optimal generalization results, with communication of only 1K parameters per round.

Abstract: Data-driven approaches for depression diagnosis have emerged as a significant research focus in neuromedicine, driven by the development of relevant datasets. Recently, graph neural network (GNN)-based models have gained widespread adoption due to their ability to capture brain channel functional connectivity from both spatial and temporal perspectives. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the absence of a robust temporal biomarker. In this paper, we introduce a novel and effective biomarker for depression diagnosis by leveraging the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and propose a customized graph network architecture based on Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN). Our model was trained on a dataset comprising 1,086 subjects, which is over 10 times larger than previous datasets in the field of depression diagnosis. Furthermore, to align with medical requirements, we performed propensity score matching (PSM) to create a refined subset, referred to as the PSM dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating our newly designed biomarker enhances the representation of temporal characteristics in brain channels, leading to improved F1 scores in both the real-world dataset and the PSM dataset. This advancement has the potential to contribute to the development of more effective depression diagnostic tools. In addition, we used SHapley Additive exPlaination (SHAP) to validate the interpretability of our model, ensuring its practical applicability in medical settings.

Abstract: Molecular optimization, aimed at improving binding affinity or other molecular properties, is a crucial task in drug discovery that often relies on the expertise of medicinal chemists. Recently, deep learning-based 3D generative models showed promise in enhancing the efficiency of molecular optimization. However, these models often struggle to adequately consider binding affinities with protein targets during lead optimization. Herein, we propose a 3D pocket-aware and affinity-guided diffusion model, named Diffleop, to optimize molecules with enhanced binding affinity. The model explicitly incorporates the knowledge of protein-ligand binding affinity to guide the denoising sampling for molecule generation with high affinity. The comprehensive evaluations indicated that Diffleop outperforms baseline models across multiple metrics, especially in terms of binding affinity.

Summary:
The study focuses on training and deploying deepfake detection models on edge devices to maintain data privacy. To overcome limited computational resources at the edge, compression techniques like pruning and quantization, alongside transfer learning methods, are explored. Experimental results show that high compression levels of 90% can be achieved without sacrificing performance when training and validation data come from the same DeepFake model. However, a domain generalization issue arises when testing data is generated by DeepFake models not seen during training. This highlights the need for addressing domain generalization challenges in deepfake detection on edge devices through effective compression and transfer learning techniques.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Training and deploying deepfake detection models on edge devices offers the advantage of maintaining data privacy and confidentiality by processing it close to its source. However, this approach is constrained by the limited computational and memory resources available at the edge. To address this challenge, we explore compression techniques to reduce computational demands and inference time, alongside transfer learning methods to minimize training overhead. Using the Synthbuster, RAISE, and ForenSynths datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of pruning, knowledge distillation (KD), quantization, fine-tuning, and adapter-based techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that both compression and transfer learning can be effectively achieved, even with a high compression level of 90%, remaining at the same performance level when the training and validation data originate from the same DeepFake model. However, when the testing dataset is generated by DeepFake models not present in the training set, a domain generalization issue becomes evident.

Abstract: The random vector functional link (RVFL) neural network has shown significant potential in overcoming the constraints of traditional artificial neural networks, such as excessive computation time and suboptimal solutions. However, RVFL faces challenges when dealing with noise and outliers, as it assumes all data samples contribute equally. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust framework, R2VFL, RVFL with Huber weighting function and class probability, which enhances the model's robustness and adaptability by effectively mitigating the impact of noise and outliers in the training data. The Huber weighting function reduces the influence of outliers, while the class probability mechanism assigns less weight to noisy data points, resulting in a more resilient model. We explore two distinct approaches for calculating class centers within the R2VFL framework: the simple average of all data points in each class and the median of each feature, the later providing a robust alternative by minimizing the effect of extreme values. These approaches give rise to two novel variants of the model-R2VFL-A and R2VFL-M. We extensively evaluate the proposed models on 47 UCI datasets, encompassing both binary and multiclass datasets, and conduct rigorous statistical testing, which confirms the superiority of the proposed models. Notably, the models also demonstrate exceptional performance in classifying EEG signals, highlighting their practical applicability in real-world biomedical domain.

Summary:<br />
Foundation models have transformed artificial intelligence, but fine-tuning for specific tasks can be computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods aim to update only a subset of parameters to reduce computational costs. This survey explores the integration of PEFT techniques in federated learning settings, categorizing approaches into Additive, Selective, and Reparameterized PEFT. Each category addresses challenges like data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and privacy in FL. The literature is organized based on application domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Promising research directions include scaling to large models, theoretical analysis of federated PEFT, and sustainable approaches for resource-constrained environments. <div>

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by providing robust, versatile architectures pre-trained on large-scale datasets. However, adapting these massive models to specific downstream tasks requires fine-tuning, which can be prohibitively expensive in computational resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by selectively updating only a small subset of parameters. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the integration of PEFT techniques within federated learning environments. We systematically categorize existing approaches into three main groups: Additive PEFT (which introduces new trainable parameters), Selective PEFT (which fine-tunes only subsets of existing parameters), and Reparameterized PEFT (which transforms model architectures to enable efficient updates). For each category, we analyze how these methods address the unique challenges of federated settings, including data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, computational constraints, and privacy concerns. We further organize the literature based on application domains, covering both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Finally, we discuss promising research directions, including scaling to larger foundation models, theoretical analysis of federated PEFT methods, and sustainable approaches for resource-constrained environments.

Summary:  
- Imbalanced regression is a challenge in prediction tasks where the target variable is skewed, affecting machine learning models like neural networks.  
- Existing solutions for imbalanced regression, adapted from class imbalance techniques, may not accurately represent the true data distribution.  
- A two-step oversampling framework called SMOGAN is proposed, with Stage 1 generating initial synthetic samples and Stage 2 using DistGAN to refine them.  
- DistGAN is a distribution-aware GAN that aligns samples with the true joint feature-target distribution through adversarial loss and Maximum Mean Discrepancy objective.  
- Extensive experiments on 23 imbalanced datasets demonstrate that SMOGAN outperforms default oversampling methods without the DistGAN filtering layer.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imbalanced regression refers to prediction tasks where the target variable is skewed. This skewness hinders machine learning models, especially neural networks, which concentrate on dense regions and therefore perform poorly on underrepresented (minority) samples. Despite the importance of this problem, only a few methods have been proposed for imbalanced regression. Many of the available solutions for imbalanced regression adapt techniques from the class imbalance domain, such as linear interpolation and the addition of Gaussian noise, to create synthetic data in sparse regions. However, in many cases, the underlying distribution of the data is complex and non-linear. Consequently, these approaches generate synthetic samples that do not accurately represent the true feature-target relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose SMOGAN, a two-step oversampling framework for imbalanced regression. In Stage 1, an existing oversampler generates initial synthetic samples in sparse target regions. In Stage 2, we introduce DistGAN, a distribution-aware GAN that serves as SMOGAN's filtering layer and refines these samples via adversarial loss augmented with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy objective, aligning them with the true joint feature-target distribution. Extensive experiments on 23 imbalanced datasets show that SMOGAN consistently outperforms the default oversampling method without the DistGAN filtering layer.

Summary:
AMP is a novel structured pruning method for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) by removing less critical structures within Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). It surpasses the current state-of-the-art on commonsense reasoning tasks by up to 1.49 percentage points and achieves a 30% pruning ratio with minimal impact on zero-shot task performance. AMP improves inference speeds, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

AMP is flexible and effective on various LLMs families, including LLaMA and Phi. <div>
arXiv:2504.21174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning drives a new wave in computing systems and triggers the automation of increasingly complex problems. In particular, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced cognitive tasks, often matching or even surpassing human-level performance. However, their extensive parameters result in high computational costs and slow inference, posing challenges for deployment in resource-limited settings. Among the strategies to overcome the aforementioned challenges, pruning emerges as a successful mechanism since it reduces model size while maintaining predictive ability. In this paper, we introduce AMP: Attention Heads and MLP Pruning, a novel structured pruning method that efficiently compresses LLMs by removing less critical structures within Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). By projecting the input data onto weights, AMP assesses structural importance and overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, which often fall short in flexibility or efficiency. In particular, AMP surpasses the current state-of-the-art on commonsense reasoning tasks by up to 1.49 percentage points, achieving a 30% pruning ratio with minimal impact on zero-shot task performance. Moreover, AMP also improves inference speeds, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments. We confirm the flexibility of AMP on different families of LLMs, including LLaMA and Phi.

Summary:<br />
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in machine learning systems is crucial for safety and reliability, particularly in dynamic environments.<br />
- Zero-shot OOD detection has been successful in vision and text domains using pretrained models, but not in graph-structured data due to complex relational structures.<br />
- A graph foundation model (GFM) enables zero-shot OOD detection without node-level supervision, outperforming existing methods on multiple datasets.<br />
- GLIP-OOD framework uses large language models (LLMs) to generate informative pseudo-OOD labels, aiding the GFM in fine-grained OOD detection without labeled nodes.<br />
- This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on text-attributed graph datasets, marking a significant advancement in zero-shot graph OOD detection. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.21186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning systems, particularly in dynamic and open-world environments. In the vision and text domains, zero-shot OOD detection - which requires no training on in-distribution (ID) data - has made significant progress through the use of large-scale pretrained models such as vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). However, zero-shot OOD detection in graph-structured data remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by complex relational structures and the absence of powerful, large-scale pretrained models for graphs. In this work, we take the first step toward enabling zero-shot graph OOD detection by leveraging a graph foundation model (GFM). We show that, when provided only with class label names, the GFM can perform OOD detection without any node-level supervision - outperforming existing supervised methods across multiple datasets. To address the more practical setting where OOD label names are unavailable, we introduce GLIP-OOD, a novel framework that employs LLMs to generate semantically informative pseudo-OOD labels from unlabeled data. These labels enable the GFM to capture nuanced semantic boundaries between ID and OOD classes and perform fine-grained OOD detection - without requiring any labeled nodes. Our approach is the first to enable node-level graph OOD detection in a fully zero-shot setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text-attributed graph datasets.

<div> FPGAs, HLS tools, LIFT, large language model, coding assistant <br />
Summary: <br />
FPGAs are gaining popularity in datacenters for their reconfigurability and energy efficiency. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools have simplified FPGA programming by allowing developers to work at a higher level of abstraction. However, achieving high performance still requires expert knowledge and manual optimization. To address this challenge, LIFT, a coding assistant powered by a large language model (LLM) and a graph neural network (GNN), automatically generates performance-critical pragmas for C/C++ designs. Through the integration of LLM and GNN, LIFT outperforms existing tools like AutoDSE and HARP, improving performance by up to 3.52x. Additionally, LIFT's designs are 66x faster than those generated by GPT-4o. This innovative approach enables developers to enhance FPGA performance without the need for extensive manual optimization. <br /> <div>

Abstract: FPGAs are increasingly adopted in datacenter environments for their reconfigurability and energy efficiency. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools have eased FPGA programming by raising the abstraction level from RTL to untimed C/C++, yet attaining high performance still demands expert knowledge and iterative manual insertion of optimization pragmas to modify the microarchitecture. To address this challenge, we propose LIFT, a large language model (LLM)-based coding assistant for HLS that automatically generates performance-critical pragmas given a C/C++ design. We fine-tune the LLM by tightly integrating and supervising the training process with a graph neural network (GNN), combining the sequential modeling capabilities of LLMs with the structural and semantic understanding of GNNs necessary for reasoning over code and its control/data dependencies. On average, LIFT produces designs that improve performance by 3.52x and 2.16x than prior state-of the art AutoDSE and HARP respectively, and 66x than GPT-4o.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is marked by significant inter-individual variability in its progression, complicating accurate prognosis and personalized care planning. This heterogeneity underscores the critical need for predictive models capable of forecasting patient-specific disease trajectories. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools to address this challenge by analyzing complex, multi-modal, and longitudinal patient data. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AI methodologies applied to personalized AD progression prediction. We review key approaches including state-space models for capturing temporal dynamics, deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modeling, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for leveraging network structures, and the emerging concept of AI-driven digital twins for individualized simulation. Recognizing that data limitations often impede progress, we examine common challenges such as high dimensionality, missing data, and dataset imbalance. We further discuss AI-driven mitigation strategies, with a specific focus on synthetic data generation using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment and balance datasets. The survey synthesizes the strengths and limitations of current approaches, emphasizing the trend towards multimodal integration and the persistent need for model interpretability and generalizability. Finally, we identify critical open challenges, including robust external validation, clinical integration, and ethical considerations, and outline promising future research directions such as hybrid models, causal inference, and federated learning. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge and guide future efforts in developing clinically relevant AI tools for personalized AD prognostication.

Summary:
Tensor-Trained Low-Rank Adaptation Mixture of Experts (TT-LoRA MoE) is a new computational framework that combines Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with sparse MoE routing to address scalability issues in large model deployments. This approach involves training lightweight, tensorized low-rank adapters (TT-LoRA experts) independently for specific tasks and then freezing them to prevent interference and forgetting in multi-task scenarios. A sparse MoE router is trained separately to dynamically select the appropriate adapter for each input at inference time. The architecture retains memory efficiency, scales to large expert pools, and achieves robust task-level optimization. It uses a small fraction of parameters compared to other methods and outperforms existing techniques in multi-tasking, making it practical and scalable for multi-task inference deployments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose Tensor-Trained Low-Rank Adaptation Mixture of Experts (TT-LoRA MoE), a novel computational framework integrating Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with sparse MoE routing to address scalability challenges in large model deployments. Unlike traditional MoE approaches, which face substantial computational overhead as expert counts grow, TT-LoRA MoE decomposes training into two distinct, optimized stages. First, we independently train lightweight, tensorized low-rank adapters (TT-LoRA experts), each specialized for specific tasks. Subsequently, these expert adapters remain frozen, eliminating inter-task interference and catastrophic forgetting in multi-task setting. A sparse MoE router, trained separately, dynamically leverages base model representations to select exactly one specialized adapter per input at inference time, automating expert selection without explicit task specification. Comprehensive experiments confirm our architecture retains the memory efficiency of low-rank adapters, seamlessly scales to large expert pools, and achieves robust task-level optimization. This structured decoupling significantly enhances computational efficiency and flexibility: uses only 2% of LoRA, 0.3% of Adapters and 0.03% of AdapterFusion parameters and outperforms AdapterFusion by 4 value in multi-tasking, enabling practical and scalable multi-task inference deployments.

<div> Keywords: out-of-distribution detection, graph, large language models, OOD exposure, synthetic OOD nodes <br />
Summary: 
GOE-LLM introduces a novel framework for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in graphs without requiring real OOD nodes. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance detection performance by introducing pseudo-OOD nodes and generating synthetic OOD nodes. The framework consists of two pipelines: identifying pseudo-OOD nodes from unlabeled graphs using LLM annotations and generating informative synthetic OOD nodes through LLM-prompted text generation. By using these pseudo-OOD nodes for training, the ID classifier is better able to detect OOD data. Experimental evaluations on various benchmark datasets show that GOE-LLM outperforms existing graph OOD detection methods that do not utilize OOD exposure and achieves comparable performance to those relying on real OOD data. This approach addresses the challenge of acquiring representative OOD samples, making it a practical and effective solution for enhancing model robustness in OOD detection for graphs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in graphs is critical for ensuring model robustness in open-world and safety-sensitive applications. Existing approaches to graph OOD detection typically involve training an in-distribution (ID) classifier using only ID data, followed by the application of post-hoc OOD scoring techniques. Although OOD exposure - introducing auxiliary OOD samples during training - has proven to be an effective strategy for enhancing detection performance, current methods in the graph domain generally assume access to a set of real OOD nodes. This assumption, however, is often impractical due to the difficulty and cost of acquiring representative OOD samples. In this paper, we introduce GOE-LLM, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for OOD exposure in graph OOD detection without requiring real OOD nodes. GOE-LLM introduces two pipelines: (1) identifying pseudo-OOD nodes from the initially unlabeled graph using zero-shot LLM annotations, and (2) generating semantically informative synthetic OOD nodes via LLM-prompted text generation. These pseudo-OOD nodes are then used to regularize the training of the ID classifier for improved OOD awareness. We evaluate our approach across multiple benchmark datasets, showing that GOE-LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph OOD detection methods that do not use OOD exposure and achieves comparable performance to those relying on real OOD data.

<div> Federated Graph Learning, Graph neural networks, Data privacy, Heterophily, FedHERO <br />
Summary: <br />
Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables collaborative training of Graph neural networks (GNNs) while maintaining data privacy. Existing FGL methods assume homophilic graph data across clients, leading to consistent knowledge learning. However, varying neighbor distribution patterns (heterophily) across client graphs can result in conflicting knowledge when aggregating local models. To address this, FedHERO is proposed, utilizing a dual-channel GNN with a structure learner to extract universal structural knowledge. This allows individual client models to leverage local and shared insights and handle graphs with diverse neighbor distribution patterns effectively. Extensive experiments validate FedHERO's superior performance compared to existing methods. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) empowers clients to collaboratively train Graph neural networks (GNNs) in a distributed manner while preserving data privacy. However, FGL methods usually require that the graph data owned by all clients is homophilic to ensure similar neighbor distribution patterns of nodes. Such an assumption ensures that the learned knowledge is consistent across the local models from all clients. Therefore, these local models can be properly aggregated as a global model without undermining the overall performance. Nevertheless, when the neighbor distribution patterns of nodes vary across different clients (e.g., when clients hold graphs with different levels of heterophily), their local models may gain different and even conflict knowledge from their node-level predictive tasks. Consequently, aggregating these local models usually leads to catastrophic performance deterioration on the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FedHERO, an FGL framework designed to harness and share insights from heterophilic graphs effectively. At the heart of FedHERO is a dual-channel GNN equipped with a structure learner, engineered to discern the structural knowledge encoded in the local graphs. With this specialized component, FedHERO enables the local model for each client to identify and learn patterns that are universally applicable across graphs with different patterns of node neighbor distributions. FedHERO not only enhances the performance of individual client models by leveraging both local and shared structural insights but also sets a new precedent in this field to effectively handle graph data with various node neighbor distribution patterns. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the superior performance of FedHERO against existing alternatives.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the ongoing issue of wildlife trafficking, exacerbated by the prevalence of e-commerce platforms which make it easier to sell illicit wildlife products. It highlights the challenge of identifying wildlife-related ads among the vast array of online marketplace listings. To address this, the paper proposes a cost-effective strategy that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo labels for a small sample of data, subsequently creating specialized classification models. The method aims to automate the process of gathering diverse ad samples and minimize labeling costs. Experimental results show that the classifiers developed using this approach outperform LLMs in terms of F1 score, at a lower cost. Real use cases demonstrate how this method enables analysis of various aspects of wildlife trafficking. <div>
arXiv:2504.21211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildlife trafficking remains a critical global issue, significantly impacting biodiversity, ecological stability, and public health. Despite efforts to combat this illicit trade, the rise of e-commerce platforms has made it easier to sell wildlife products, putting new pressure on wild populations of endangered and threatened species. The use of these platforms also opens a new opportunity: as criminals sell wildlife products online, they leave digital traces of their activity that can provide insights into trafficking activities as well as how they can be disrupted. The challenge lies in finding these traces. Online marketplaces publish ads for a plethora of products, and identifying ads for wildlife-related products is like finding a needle in a haystack. Learning classifiers can automate ad identification, but creating them requires costly, time-consuming data labeling that hinders support for diverse ads and research questions. This paper addresses a critical challenge in the data science pipeline for wildlife trafficking analytics: generating quality labeled data for classifiers that select relevant data. While large language models (LLMs) can directly label advertisements, doing so at scale is prohibitively expensive. We propose a cost-effective strategy that leverages LLMs to generate pseudo labels for a small sample of the data and uses these labels to create specialized classification models. Our novel method automatically gathers diverse and representative samples to be labeled while minimizing the labeling costs. Our experimental evaluation shows that our classifiers achieve up to 95% F1 score, outperforming LLMs at a lower cost. We present real use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling analyses of different aspects of wildlife trafficking.

Abstract: Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to provide robust and generalizable representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sserranw/ABG-NAS.

Summary: 
In this study, the authors investigate causal discovery in a multi-domain scenario where causal functions remain consistent across domains while exogenous noise distribution may vary. They demonstrate that with causal sufficiency and the presence of bijective generation mechanisms (BGM), causal diagrams can be discovered with less strict functional assumptions. BGM, encompassing various models such as additive noise, LiNGAM, post-nonlinear, and location-scale noise models, ensures that the functional relationship between exogenous noise and the endogenous variable is bijective and differentiable for every level of the cause variable. Additionally, the study presents a statistical test for determining the parents set of the target variable. Through experiments on diverse datasets, both synthetic and real-world, the theoretical findings are validated, emphasizing the effectiveness of BGM in enabling causal discovery in multi-domain settings. <div>

Abstract: We consider the problem of causal discovery (a.k.a., causal structure learning) in a multi-domain setting. We assume that the causal functions are invariant across the domains, while the distribution of the exogenous noise may vary. Under causal sufficiency (i.e., no confounders exist), we show that the causal diagram can be discovered under less restrictive functional assumptions compared to previous work. What enables causal discovery in this setting is bijective generation mechanisms (BGM), which ensures that the functional relation between the exogenous noise $E$ and the endogenous variable $Y$ is bijective and differentiable in both directions at every level of the cause variable $X = x$. BGM generalizes a variety of models including additive noise model, LiNGAM, post-nonlinear model, and location-scale noise model. Further, we derive a statistical test to find the parents set of the target variable. Experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical findings.

Summary: 
The proposed orthogonal factor-based biclustering algorithm (BCBOF) addresses limitations faced by traditional biclustering algorithms when processing high-dimensional data. By constructing orthogonal factors and performing clustering in an orthogonal subspace, BCBOF effectively reduces data sparsity and preserves critical local structural patterns. The algorithm was applied to stock technical indicators and stock price trend prediction, generating fuzzy rules for trading signals. BCBOF outperformed existing biclustering methods based on multiple evaluation metrics. In virtual trading experiments using historical data from 10 A-share stocks, the fuzzy inference system generated higher returns for investors. <div>

Abstract: Biclustering is an effective technique in data mining and pattern recognition. Biclustering algorithms based on traditional clustering face two fundamental limitations when processing high-dimensional data: (1) The distance concentration phenomenon in high-dimensional spaces leads to data sparsity, rendering similarity measures ineffective; (2) Mainstream linear dimensionality reduction methods disrupt critical local structural patterns. To apply biclustering to high-dimensional datasets, we propose an orthogonal factor-based biclustering algorithm (BCBOF). First, we constructed orthogonal factors in the vector space of the high-dimensional dataset. Then, we performed clustering using the coordinates of the original data in the orthogonal subspace as clustering targets. Finally, we obtained biclustering results of the original dataset. Since dimensionality reduction was applied before clustering, the proposed algorithm effectively mitigated the data sparsity problem caused by high dimensionality. Additionally, we applied this biclustering algorithm to stock technical indicator combinations and stock price trend prediction. Biclustering results were transformed into fuzzy rules, and we incorporated profit-preserving and stop-loss rules into the rule set, ultimately forming a fuzzy inference system for stock price trend predictions and trading signals. To evaluate the performance of BCBOF, we compared it with existing biclustering methods using multiple evaluation metrics. The results showed that our algorithm outperformed other biclustering techniques. To validate the effectiveness of the fuzzy inference system, we conducted virtual trading experiments using historical data from 10 A-share stocks. The experimental results showed that the generated trading strategies yielded higher returns for investors.

<div> Keywords: feature transformation, unsupervised learning, generator-critic framework, LLM agents, data readiness

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to feature transformation that aims to enhance data utility in domains with large dimensionality and limited labeled data availability. The proposed framework utilizes a generator-critic duet-play teaming strategy with LLM agents to derive pseudo-supervision from unsupervised data. The framework consists of three main steps: the critic agent diagnoses data to provide advice, the generator agent produces tokenized feature transformations guided by the critic's advice, and iterative refinement ensures continuous improvement through feedback between agents. This framework can also be extended to human-agent collaborative generation by involving human experts in the process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework surpasses supervised baselines in terms of efficiency, robustness, and practical applicability across various datasets. <div>

Abstract: Feature transformation involves generating a new set of features from the original dataset to enhance the data's utility. In certain domains like material performance screening, dimensionality is large and collecting labels is expensive and lengthy. It highly necessitates transforming feature spaces efficiently and without supervision to enhance data readiness and AI utility. However, existing methods fall short in efficient navigation of a vast space of feature combinations, and are mostly designed for supervised settings. To fill this gap, our unique perspective is to leverage a generator-critic duet-play teaming framework using LLM agents and in-context learning to derive pseudo-supervision from unsupervised data. The framework consists of three interconnected steps: (1) Critic agent diagnoses data to generate actionable advice, (2) Generator agent produces tokenized feature transformations guided by the critic's advice, and (3) Iterative refinement ensures continuous improvement through feedback between agents. The generator-critic framework can be generalized to human-agent collaborative generation, by replacing the critic agent with human experts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms even supervised baselines in feature transformation efficiency, robustness, and practical applicability across diverse datasets.

Summary: <br />
The article explores the use of auto-regressive (AR) diffusion models to enhance the capture of conditional dependence structures in data. The study shows that AR diffusion models produce samples that better approximate the data conditional distribution compared to typical diffusion models. The AR variant also demonstrates practicality for large-scale applications, with only a moderate increase in inference time. Empirical results indicate that AR diffusion models effectively capture conditional dependence structures when present in the data, while vanilla DDPM models struggle in such cases. However, when no clear conditional dependence is observed across data patches, AR diffusion models do not outperform DDPM. This research offers insights into strengthening diffusion models to better represent high-level relationships in image and video generation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.21314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated appealing performance in both image and video generation. However, many works discover that they struggle to capture important, high-level relationships that are present in the real world. For example, they fail to learn physical laws from data, and even fail to understand that the objects in the world exist in a stable fashion. This is due to the fact that important conditional dependence structures are not adequately captured in the vanilla diffusion models. In this work, we initiate an in-depth study on strengthening the diffusion model to capture the conditional dependence structures in the data. In particular, we examine the efficacy of the auto-regressive (AR) diffusion models for such purpose and develop the first theoretical results on the sampling error of AR diffusion models under (possibly) the mildest data assumption. Our theoretical findings indicate that, compared with typical diffusion models, the AR variant produces samples with a reduced gap in approximating the data conditional distribution. On the other hand, the overall inference time of the AR-diffusion models is only moderately larger than that for the vanilla diffusion models, making them still practical for large scale applications. We also provide empirical results showing that when there is clear conditional dependence structure in the data, the AR diffusion models captures such structure, whereas vanilla DDPM fails to do so. On the other hand, when there is no obvious conditional dependence across patches of the data, AR diffusion does not outperform DDPM.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach called action decomposed reinforcement learning to address the challenges posed by discrete factored action spaces in practical reinforcement learning environments. By leveraging a lower dimensional projected subspace of the original action space, the proposed method aims to improve sample complexity by approximating the Q-function in standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. The approach ensures unbiasedness of decomposed Q-functions using causal effect estimation techniques from causal statistics, particularly in the no unobserved confounder setting. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in improving sample efficiency in both online continuous control environments and a real-world offline sepsis treatment environment. By considering the structure of the action space and utilizing projected Q-functions, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various settings. <div>
arXiv:2504.21326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many practical reinforcement learning environments have a discrete factored action space that induces a large combinatorial set of actions, thereby posing significant challenges. Existing approaches leverage the regular structure of the action space and resort to a linear decomposition of Q-functions, which avoids enumerating all combinations of factored actions. In this paper, we consider Q-functions defined over a lower dimensional projected subspace of the original action space, and study the condition for the unbiasedness of decomposed Q-functions using causal effect estimation from the no unobserved confounder setting in causal statistics. This leads to a general scheme which we call action decomposed reinforcement learning that uses the projected Q-functions to approximate the Q-function in standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed approach is shown to improve sample complexity in a model-based reinforcement learning setting. We demonstrate improvements in sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines in online continuous control environments and a real-world offline sepsis treatment environment.

<div> Keywords: meta federated learning, personalized variant, fine-tuning steps, convergence analysis, real-world datasets<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new approach called meta federated learning, a personalized version of federated learning where agents collaborate without sharing raw data. The goal is to train a shared initial model that can be easily adapted to local datasets through fine-tuning. Unlike conventional methods that focus on minimizing average loss after one fine-tuning step, this approach considers multiple fine-tuning steps to better accommodate heterogeneous data distributions across agents. A variant of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm is proposed, with theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating faster convergence and improved accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. <div>
arXiv:2504.21327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta federated learning (FL) is a personalized variant of FL, where multiple agents collaborate on training an initial shared model without exchanging raw data samples. The initial model should be trained in a way that current or new agents can easily adapt it to their local datasets after one or a few fine-tuning steps, thus improving the model personalization. Conventional meta FL approaches minimize the average loss of agents on the local models obtained after one step of fine-tuning. In practice, agents may need to apply several fine-tuning steps to adapt the global model to their local data, especially under highly heterogeneous data distributions across agents. To this end, we present a generalized framework for the meta FL by minimizing the average loss of agents on their local model after any arbitrary number $\nu$ of fine-tuning steps. For this generalized framework, we present a variant of the well-known federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm and conduct a comprehensive theoretical convergence analysis to characterize the convergence speed as well as behavior of the meta loss functions in both the exact and approximated cases. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and faster convergence for the proposed scheme compared to conventional approaches.

<div> Neural Networks, Physics-Informed, PDEs, Multi-grid Method, Transfer Learning <br />
Summary: <br />
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving PDEs but face challenges with stiff and high-frequency problems. A new approach inspired by the multi-grid method aims to address these issues. By training with different levels of samples, the method effectively reduces frequency errors, improving accuracy without needing complex adjustments to neural network structures or hyperparameters. Testing on 1D ODE and 2D convection-diffusion equations demonstrates the approach's efficacy. Application to Lid-driven cavity flows at varying Reynolds numbers showcases significant accuracy improvements of 30% to 60%. Synergies with transfer learning techniques further enhance predictions, even for complex high-frequency PDEs such as Re=5000. The study highlights the potential of this method for solving challenging problems in physics and computer science. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.21328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks have emerged as a promising methodology for solving PDEs, gaining significant attention in computer science and various physics-related fields. Despite being demonstrated the ability to incorporate the physics of laws for versatile applications, PINNs still struggle with the challenging problems which are stiff to be solved and/or have high-frequency components in the solutions, resulting in accuracy and convergence issues. It may not only increase computational costs, but also lead to accuracy loss or solution divergence. In this study, an alternative approach is proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. Inspired by the multi-grid method in CFD community, the underlying idea of the current approach is to efficiently remove different frequency errors via training with different levels of training samples, resulting in a simpler way to improve the training accuracy without spending time in fine-tuning of neural network structures, loss weights as well as hyperparameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of current approach, we first investigate canonical 1D ODE with high-frequency component and 2D convection-diffusion equation with V-cycle training strategy. Finally, the current method is employed for the classical benchmark problem of steady Lid-driven cavity flows at different Reynolds numbers, to investigate the applicability and efficacy for the problem involved multiple modes of high and low frequency. By virtue of various training sequence modes, improvement through predictions lead to 30% to 60% accuracy improvement. We also investigate the synergies between current method and transfer learning techniques for more challenging problems (i.e., higher Re). From the present results, it also revealed that the current framework can produce good predictions even for the case of Re=5000, demonstrating the ability to solve complex high-frequency PDEs.

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction plays a crucial role in optimizing resource management and enhancing user satisfaction across both telecommunication and OTT services. While recent advances predominantly rely on deep learning models, this study introduces a lightweight generative modeling framework that balances computational efficiency, interpretability, and predictive accuracy. By validating the use of Vector Quantization (VQ) as a preprocessing technique, continuous network features are effectively transformed into discrete categorical symbols, enabling integration with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for temporal sequence modeling. This VQ-HMM pipeline enhances the model's capacity to capture dynamic QoE patterns while supporting probabilistic inference on new and unseen data. Experimental results on publicly available time-series datasets incorporating both objective indicators and subjective QoE scores demonstrate the viability of this approach in real-time and resource-constrained environments, where inference latency is also critical. The framework offers a scalable alternative to complex deep learning methods, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources or where latency constraints are critical.

Summary:<br />
This study compares various Machine Learning methods for long-term traffic forecasting, considering up to 30-day horizons on real-world datasets. While Deep Learning models like RNN and Transformers excel in capturing long-range dependencies, the importance shifts towards periodicity modeling over time. Time embedding enhances RNN performance significantly compared to Transformer in long-term forecasting. XGBoost, despite using only time features, competes well with Deep Learning methods. Factors like input sequence length, holiday traffic, data granularity, and training data size are also considered. These findings provide insights for improving AI's learning capabilities in long-term traffic forecasting scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2504.21358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic forecasting is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems, for which Machine Learning (ML) methods have been extensively explored to develop data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. Recent research focuses on modelling spatial-temporal correlations for short-term traffic prediction, leaving the favourable long-term forecasting a challenging and open issue. This paper presents a comparative study on large-scale real-world signalized arterials and freeway traffic flow datasets, aiming to evaluate promising ML methods in the context of large forecasting horizons up to 30 days. Focusing on modelling capacity for temporal dynamics, we develop one ensemble ML method, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and a range of Deep Learning (DL) methods, including Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based methods and the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method. Time embedding is leveraged to enhance their understanding of seasonality and event factors. Experimental results highlight that while the attention mechanism/Transformer framework is effective for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, as the forecasting horizon extends, the key to effective traffic forecasting gradually shifts from temporal dependency capturing to periodicity modelling. Time embedding is particularly effective in this context, helping naive RNN outperform Informer by 31.1% for 30-day-ahead forecasting. Meanwhile, as an efficient and robust model, XGBoost, while learning solely from time features, performs competitively with DL methods. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of various factors like input sequence length, holiday traffic, data granularity, and training data size. The findings offer valuable insights and serve as a reference for future long-term traffic forecasting research and the improvement of AI's corresponding learning capabilities.

arXiv:2504.21375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal representation learning has become a pivotal area in artificial intelligence, enabling the integration of diverse modalities such as vision, text, and audio to solve complex problems. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on bimodal interactions, such as image-text pairs, which limits their ability to fully exploit the richness of multi-modal data. Furthermore, the integration of modalities in equal-scale environments remains underexplored due to the challenges of constructing large-scale, balanced datasets. In this study, we propose Synergy-CLIP, a novel framework that extends the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) architecture to enhance multi-modal representation learning by integrating visual, textual, and audio modalities. Unlike existing methods that focus on adapting individual modalities to vanilla-CLIP, Synergy-CLIP aligns and captures latent information across three modalities equally. To address the high cost of constructing large-scale multi-modal datasets, we introduce VGG-sound+, a triple-modal dataset designed to provide equal-scale representation of visual, textual, and audio data. Synergy-CLIP is validated on various downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, where it outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, we introduce a missing modality reconstruction task, demonstrating Synergy-CLIP's ability to extract synergy among modalities in realistic application scenarios. These contributions provide a robust foundation for advancing multi-modal representation learning and exploring new research directions.

Summary: 
This paper introduces the concept of sparse-to-sparse training in diffusion models (DMs) to improve training and inference efficiency in generative models. The researchers trained sparse DMs from scratch on various datasets using different methods and found that sparse DMs could match or even outperform their dense counterparts while reducing the number of parameters and floating point operations. By studying the effect of sparsity on model performance, the experiments highlighted safe and effective values for implementing sparse-to-sparse training in DMs. The results show that sparse DMs offer a promising approach to achieving high-quality sample generation with lower computational resources in tasks such as image synthesis, natural language processing, and temporal data modeling. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are a powerful type of generative models that have achieved state-of-the-art results in various image synthesis tasks and have shown potential in other domains, such as natural language processing and temporal data modeling. Despite their stable training dynamics and ability to produce diverse high-quality samples, DMs are notorious for requiring significant computational resources, both in the training and inference stages. Previous work has focused mostly on increasing the efficiency of model inference. This paper introduces, for the first time, the paradigm of sparse-to-sparse training to DMs, with the aim of improving both training and inference efficiency. We focus on unconditional generation and train sparse DMs from scratch (Latent Diffusion and ChiroDiff) on six datasets using three different methods (Static-DM, RigL-DM, and MagRan-DM) to study the effect of sparsity in model performance. Our experiments show that sparse DMs are able to match and often outperform their Dense counterparts, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters and FLOPs. We also identify safe and effective values to perform sparse-to-sparse training of DMs.

Summary:<br />Recent advancements in offline reinforcement learning have focused on addressing overestimation of Q-values for out-of-distribution actions. High stakes applications like recommendation systems in online gaming face challenges due to player psychology and platform volatility. Current methods struggle with learning from sparse and overlapping state spaces across policies. FAST-Q introduces Gradient Reversal Learning to balance state representations, enabling counterfactual estimation. It supports offline exploration alongside static data exploitation and includes a Q-value decomposition strategy for multi-objective optimization. FAST-Q outperforms previous methods, leading to increased player returns, improved lifetime value and engagement, longer platform dwell time, and reduced recommendation costs by 10% on a volatile gaming platform. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) offline reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on addressing function approximation errors, which contribute to the overestimation of Q-values for out-of-distribution actions, a challenge that static datasets exacerbate. However, high stakes applications such as recommendation systems in online gaming, introduce further complexities due to player's psychology (intent) driven by gameplay experiences and the inherent volatility on the platform. These factors create highly sparse, partially overlapping state spaces across policies, further influenced by the experiment path selection logic which biases state spaces towards specific policies. Current SOTA methods constrain learning from such offline data by clipping known counterfactual actions as out-of-distribution due to poor generalization across unobserved states. Further aggravating conservative Q-learning and necessitating more online exploration. FAST-Q introduces a novel approach that (1) leverages Gradient Reversal Learning to construct balanced state representations, regularizing the policy-specific bias between the player's state and action thereby enabling counterfactual estimation; (2) supports offline counterfactual exploration in parallel with static data exploitation; and (3) proposes a Q-value decomposition strategy for multi-objective optimization, facilitating explainable recommendations over short and long-term objectives. These innovations demonstrate superiority of FAST-Q over prior SOTA approaches and demonstrates at least 0.15 percent increase in player returns, 2 percent improvement in lifetime value (LTV), 0.4 percent enhancement in the recommendation driven engagement, 2 percent improvement in the player's platform dwell time and an impressive 10 percent reduction in the costs associated with the recommendation, on our volatile gaming platform.

Abstract: In tackling frequent anomalies in stamping processes, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised in-process anomaly monitoring framework, utilizing accelerometer signals and physics information, to capture the process anomaly effectively. The proposed framework facilitates the construction of a monitoring model with imbalanced sample distribution, which enables in-process condition monitoring in real-time to prevent batch anomalies, which helps to reduce batch defects risk and enhance production yield. Firstly, to effectively capture key features from raw data containing redundant information, a hybrid feature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize data-driven methods and physical mechanisms simultaneously. Secondly, to address the challenge brought by imbalanced sample distribution, a semi-supervised anomaly detection model is established, which merely employs normal samples to build a golden baseline model, and a novel deviation score is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of each online stamping stroke. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is validated with various classification algorithms. A real-world in-process dataset from stamping manufacturing workshop is employed to illustrate the superiority of proposed semi-supervised framework with enhance performance for process anomaly monitoring.

Summary: <br />
Accurate classification of EEG signals is crucial for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetic applications. Traditional classification methods often overlook the non-Euclidean, manifold structure of EEG data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, MPEC introduces a feature engineering phase that combines covariance matrices and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels to capture linear and non-linear relationships among EEG channels. Additionally, MPEC utilizes a clustering phase with a modified K-means algorithm tailored for the Riemannian manifold space to ensure local geometric sensitivity. By ensembling multiple clustering-based classifiers, MPEC achieves superior results, as demonstrated by significant improvements on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. <div>

Abstract: Accurate classification of EEG signals is crucial for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetic applications, yet many existing methods fail to account for the non-Euclidean, manifold structure of EEG data, resulting in suboptimal performance. Preserving this manifold information is essential to capture the true geometry of EEG signals, but traditional classification techniques largely overlook this need. To this end, we propose MPEC (Manifold-Preserved EEG Classification via an Ensemble of Clustering-Based Classifiers), that introduces two key innovations: (1) a feature engineering phase that combines covariance matrices and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels to capture both linear and non-linear relationships among EEG channels, and (2) a clustering phase that employs a modified K-means algorithm tailored for the Riemannian manifold space, ensuring local geometric sensitivity. Ensembling multiple clustering-based classifiers, MPEC achieves superior results, validated by significant improvements on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel label distribution inference attack in Federated Learning that is stable and adaptable. It estimates the size of a victim client's dataset and creates virtual clients tailored to them. By quantifying the temporal generalization of class labels for these virtual clients, an inference model is trained to predict the victim client's label distribution proportions. The approach is evaluated on various datasets and outperforms existing techniques, even under differential privacy defenses. The results highlight the effectiveness and potential real-world applications of this new attack method. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative training of a global model across multiple geographically dispersed clients without the need for data sharing. However, it is susceptible to inference attacks, particularly label inference attacks.
  Existing studies on label distribution inference exhibits sensitive to the specific settings of the victim client and typically underperforms under defensive strategies. In this study, we propose a novel label distribution inference attack that is stable and adaptable to various scenarios. Specifically, we estimate the size of the victim client's dataset and construct several virtual clients tailored to the victim client. We then quantify the temporal generalization of each class label for the virtual clients and utilize the variation in temporal generalization to train an inference model that predicts the label distribution proportions of the victim client.
  We validate our approach on multiple datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, FER2013, and AG-News. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, our attack remains effective even under differential privacy defense mechanisms, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.

<div> new neural network, EEG data analysis, dementia classification, interpretability, overfitting reduction 
Summary:<br /> 
A new neural network, xEEGNet, is introduced for EEG data analysis focusing on classifying Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia versus controls. xEEGNet is compact, explainable, and fully interpretable with major parameter reduction to reduce overfitting. The model is derived from ShallowNet and modified for increased transparency without sacrificing performance, using only 168 parameters. Robust cross-validation confirms xEEGNet's comparable performance to larger models. Variability across data splits is explained by EEG representations, showing higher accuracy in separating controls and Alzheimer's cases. The model's ability to filter EEG bands, learn topographies, and use spectral features demonstrates its interpretability. This study highlights the effectiveness of smaller architectures like xEEGNet in EEG pathology classification, challenging the notion that larger models are always superior in performance. <div>
arXiv:2504.21457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents xEEGNet, a novel, compact, and explainable neural network for EEG data analysis. It is fully interpretable and reduces overfitting through major parameter reduction. As an applicative use case, we focused on classifying common dementia conditions, Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, versus controls. xEEGNet is broadly applicable to other neurological conditions involving spectral alterations. We initially used ShallowNet, a simple and popular model from the EEGNet-family. Its structure was analyzed and gradually modified to move from a "black box" to a more transparent model, without compromising performance. The learned kernels and weights were examined from a clinical standpoint to assess medical relevance. Model variants, including ShallowNet and the final xEEGNet, were evaluated using robust Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation for unbiased performance estimates. Variability across data splits was explained using embedded EEG representations, grouped by class and set, with pairwise separability to quantify group distinction. Overfitting was assessed through training-validation loss correlation and training speed. xEEGNet uses only 168 parameters, 200 times fewer than ShallowNet, yet retains interpretability, resists overfitting, achieves comparable median performance (-1.5%), and reduces variability across splits. This variability is explained by embedded EEG representations: higher accuracy correlates with greater separation between test set controls and Alzheimer's cases, without significant influence from training data. xEEGNet's ability to filter specific EEG bands, learn band-specific topographies, and use relevant spectral features demonstrates its interpretability. While large deep learning models are often prioritized for performance, this study shows smaller architectures like xEEGNet can be equally effective in EEG pathology classification.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel optimization framework for least squares learning problems in fully connected neural networks and physics-informed neural networks. Traditional gradient descent methods can be inefficient in deep learning due to the non-convexity of loss functions and the vanishing gradient issue. The proposed approach addresses these challenges by introducing auxiliary variables to separate the network layers and reformulating the loss functions to facilitate optimization. Self-adaptive weights are designed to maintain consistency between the reformulated loss and the original mean squared loss, ensuring that optimizing the new loss also optimizes the original problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the models compared to gradient descent, confirming the consistency between the reformulated and original loss functions. This new framework offers a promising direction for enhancing the efficiency and performance of deep learning algorithms.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new optimization framework for the least squares learning problem via fully connected neural networks or physics-informed neural networks. The gradient descent sometimes behaves inefficiently in deep learning because of the high non-convexity of loss functions and the vanishing gradient issue. Our idea is to introduce auxiliary variables to separate the layers of the deep neural networks and reformulate the loss functions for ease of optimization. We design the self-adaptive weights to preserve the consistency between the reformulated loss and the original mean squared loss, which guarantees that optimizing the new loss helps optimize the original problem. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the consistency and show the effectiveness and robustness of our models over gradient descent.

Summary:
The article proposes a proactive self-adaptive approach for AI models deployed in non-stationary environments, particularly in medical settings where temporal dataset shifts are common. The approach involves modeling the temporal trajectory of AI parameters using polynomial spline bases within a Functional Data Analysis framework. By short-term forecasting parameter values, the approach addresses prior probability shift, covariate shift, and concept shift. Validation on simulated and real-world COVID-19 datasets from Mexico shows that the pro-adaptive approach enhances AI performance against shifts compared to baseline models trained at different time distances. This method does not require updated training data, making it suitable for resilient AI production environments in healthcare. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deployed in production frequently face challenges in maintaining their performance in non-stationary environments. This issue is particularly noticeable in medical settings, where temporal dataset shifts often occur. These shifts arise when the distributions of training data differ from those of the data encountered during deployment over time. Further, new labeled data to continuously retrain AI is not typically available in a timely manner due to data access limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a proactive self-adaptive AI approach, or pro-adaptive, where we model the temporal trajectory of AI parameters, allowing us to short-term forecast parameter values. To this end, we use polynomial spline bases, within an extensible Functional Data Analysis framework. We validate our methodology with a logistic regression model addressing prior probability shift, covariate shift, and concept shift. This validation is conducted on both a controlled simulated dataset and a publicly available real-world COVID-19 dataset from Mexico, with various shifts occurring between 2020 and 2024. Our results indicate that this approach enhances the performance of AI against shifts compared to baseline stable models trained at different time distances from the present, without requiring updated training data. This work lays the foundation for pro-adaptive AI research against dynamic, non-stationary environments, being compatible with data protection, in resilient AI production environments for health.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward algorithm has evolved in machine learning research, tackling more complex tasks that mimic real-life applications. In the last years, it has been improved by several techniques to perform better than its original version, handling a challenging dataset like CIFAR10 without losing its flexibility and low memory usage. We have shown in our results that improvements are achieved through a combination of convolutional channel grouping, learning rate schedules, and independent block structures during training that lead to a 20\% decrease in test error percentage. Additionally, to approach further implementations on low-capacity hardware projects we have presented a series of lighter models that achieve low test error percentages within (21$\pm$6)\% and number of trainable parameters between 164,706 and 754,386. This serving also as a basis for our future study on complete verification and validation of these kinds of neural networks.

Summary: 
The article proposes a novel approach called Recursive KL Divergence Optimization (RKDO) that generalizes representation learning objectives by reframing them as recursive divergence alignment processes over localized conditional distributions. This dynamic formalism captures contrastive clustering and dimensionality reduction methods while offering stability and local adaptation. Experiment results show that RKDO offers efficiency advantages, with approximately 30% lower loss values compared to static approaches across different datasets and a 60 to 80% reduction in computational resources needed for similar results. The recursive updating mechanism of RKDO creates a more efficient optimization landscape for representation learning, with significant implications for resource-constrained applications. <div>

Abstract: We propose a generalization of modern representation learning objectives by reframing them as recursive divergence alignment processes over localized conditional distributions While recent frameworks like Information Contrastive Learning I-Con unify multiple learning paradigms through KL divergence between fixed neighborhood conditionals we argue this view underplays a crucial recursive structure inherent in the learning process. We introduce Recursive KL Divergence Optimization RKDO a dynamic formalism where representation learning is framed as the evolution of KL divergences across data neighborhoods. This formulation captures contrastive clustering and dimensionality reduction methods as static slices while offering a new path to model stability and local adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that RKDO offers dual efficiency advantages approximately 30 percent lower loss values compared to static approaches across three different datasets and 60 to 80 percent reduction in computational resources needed to achieve comparable results. This suggests that RKDOs recursive updating mechanism provides a fundamentally more efficient optimization landscape for representation learning with significant implications for resource constrained applications.

Summary: 
HetPFL is a novel approach in federated learning that aims to handle the performance-fairness trade-offs by effectively learning both local and global Pareto fronts. The proposed method, comprising Preference Sampling Adaptation (PSA) and Preference-aware Hypernet Fusion (PHF), addresses the limitations of existing methods by adaptively determining optimal preference sampling distributions for each client to accommodate heterogeneous local Pareto fronts, and performing preference-aware fusion of clients' hypernets to ensure the performance of the global Pareto front. HetPFL is proven to converge linearly with respect to the number of rounds, under weaker assumptions than existing methods. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that HetPFL outperforms seven baselines in terms of the quality of learned local and global Pareto fronts. <div>

Abstract: Recent methods leverage a hypernet to handle the performance-fairness trade-offs in federated learning. This hypernet maps the clients' preferences between model performance and fairness to preference-specifc models on the trade-off curve, known as local Pareto front. However, existing methods typically adopt a uniform preference sampling distribution to train the hypernet across clients, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of their local Pareto fronts. Meanwhile, from the perspective of generalization, they do not consider the gap between local and global Pareto fronts on the global dataset. To address these limitations, we propose HetPFL to effectively learn both local and global Pareto fronts. HetPFL comprises Preference Sampling Adaptation (PSA) and Preference-aware Hypernet Fusion (PHF). PSA adaptively determines the optimal preference sampling distribution for each client to accommodate heterogeneous local Pareto fronts. While PHF performs preference-aware fusion of clients' hypernets to ensure the performance of the global Pareto front. We prove that HetPFL converges linearly with respect to the number of rounds, under weaker assumptions than existing methods. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that HetPFL significantly outperforms seven baselines in terms of the quality of learned local and global Pareto fronts.

Summary: 
This paper introduces whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering. The algorithms consider split and merge events of line segments to analyze object movement history. Whole-trajectory clustering examines entire entities' trajectories, while sub-trajectory clustering identifies similar sub-trajectories using a sliding window model. The stable trajectory clustering algorithm selectively omits temporary anomalies to preserve clustering patterns and improve stability and interpretability. By running these algorithms on real trajectory datasets, the study demonstrates their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations. <div>

Abstract: Clustering algorithms group data points by characteristics to identify patterns. Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.

Abstract: This study examines the digital value chain in automotive manufacturing, focusing on the identification, software flashing, customization, and commissioning of electronic control units in vehicle networks. A novel precedence graph design is proposed to optimize this process chain using an automated scheduling algorithm that employs mixed integer linear programming techniques. The results show significant improvements in key metrics. The algorithm reduces the number of production stations equipped with expensive hardware and software to execute digital value chain processes, while increasing capacity utilization through efficient scheduling and reduced idle time. Task parallelization is optimized, resulting in streamlined workflows and increased throughput. Compared to the traditional method, the automated approach has reduced preparation time by 50% and reduced scheduling activities, as it now takes two minutes to create the precedence graph. The flexibility of the algorithm's constraints allows for vehicle-specific configurations while maintaining high responsiveness, eliminating backup stations and facilitating the integration of new topologies. Automated scheduling significantly outperforms manual methods in efficiency, functionality, and adaptability.

AI supply chains have become common in the development of AI products, involving various actors contributing models and datasets. The historical perspective reveals a shift towards specialization and outsourcing in the AI industry. Modeling AI supply chains as directed graphs helps in understanding complex issues. The case studies highlight challenges such as imperfect information passing along supply chains leading to misunderstandings with real-world consequences, and upstream design choices impacting downstream AI products. These findings emphasize the need for further research on AI supply chains to address social, economic, regulatory, and technical implications.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI in recent years has led to the emergence of AI supply chains: complex networks of AI actors contributing models, datasets, and more to the development of AI products and services. AI supply chains have many implications yet are poorly understood. In this work, we take a first step toward a formal study of AI supply chains and their implications, providing two illustrative case studies indicating that both AI development and regulation are complicated in the presence of supply chains. We begin by presenting a brief historical perspective on AI supply chains, discussing how their rise reflects a longstanding shift towards specialization and outsourcing that signals the healthy growth of the AI industry. We then model AI supply chains as directed graphs and demonstrate the power of this abstraction by connecting examples of AI issues to graph properties. Finally, we examine two case studies in detail, providing theoretical and empirical results in both. In the first, we show that information passing (specifically, of explanations) along the AI supply chains is imperfect, which can result in misunderstandings that have real-world implications. In the second, we show that upstream design choices (e.g., by base model providers) have downstream consequences (e.g., on AI products fine-tuned on the base model). Together, our findings motivate further study of AI supply chains and their increasingly salient social, economic, regulatory, and technical implications.

Abstract: After two years of appearance, COVID-19 has negatively affected people and normal life around the world. As in May 2022, there are more than 522 million cases and six million deaths worldwide (including nearly ten million cases and over forty-three thousand deaths in Vietnam). Economy and society are both severely affected. The variant of COVID-19, Omicron, has broken disease prevention measures of countries and rapidly increased number of infections. Resources overloading in treatment and epidemics prevention is happening all over the world. It can be seen that, application of artificial intelligence (AI) to support people at this time is extremely necessary. There have been many studies applying AI to prevent COVID-19 which are extremely useful, and studies on machine reading comprehension (MRC) are also in it. Realizing that, we created the first MRC dataset about COVID-19 for Vietnamese: ViQA-COVID and can be used to build models and systems, contributing to disease prevention. Besides, ViQA-COVID is also the first multi-span extraction MRC dataset for Vietnamese, we hope that it can contribute to promoting MRC studies in Vietnamese and multilingual.

Summary:
HYPEROFA addresses the suboptimal performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on mid- and low-resource languages by introducing a hypernetwork-based approach for adaptive token embedding initialization. Unlike OFA, which restricts target-language token embeddings to convex combinations of source-language embeddings, HYPEROFA allows for more flexible embeddings. The hypernetwork is trained to map from a multilingual word vector space to the PLMs token embedding space using source-language tokens. Experiments show that HYPEROFA outperforms random initialization and matches or exceeds OFA in continual pre-training convergence and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Many pre-trained language models (PLMs) exhibit suboptimal performance on mid- and low-resource languages, largely due to limited exposure to these languages during pre-training. A common strategy to address this is to introduce new tokens specific to the target languages, initialize their embeddings, and apply continual pre-training on target-language data. Among such methods, OFA (Liu et al., 2024a) proposes a similarity-based subword embedding initialization heuristic that is both effective and efficient. However, OFA restricts target-language token embeddings to be convex combinations of a fixed number of source-language embeddings, which may limit expressiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose HYPEROFA, a hypernetwork-based approach for more adaptive token embedding initialization. The hypernetwork is trained to map from an external multilingual word vector space to the PLMs token embedding space using source-language tokens. Once trained, it can generate flexible embeddings for target-language tokens, serving as a good starting point for continual pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that HYPEROFA consistently outperforms random initialization baseline and matches or exceeds the performance of OFA in both continual pre-training convergence and downstream task performance. We make the code publicly available.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, generating high-quality text that balances coherence, diversity, and relevance remains challenging. Traditional decoding methods, such as bean search and top-k sampling, often struggle with either repetitive or incoherent outputs, particularly in tasks that require long-form text generation. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a novel enhancement of the well-known Contrastive Search algorithm, Context-Enhanced Contrastive Search (CECS) with contextual calibration. The proposed scheme introduces several novelties including dynamic contextual importance weighting, multi-level Contrastive Search, and adaptive temperature control, to optimize the balance between fluency, creativity, and precision. The performance of CECS is evaluated using several standard metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and semantic similarity. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both coherence and relevance of the generated texts by CECS outperforming the existing Contrastive Search techniques. The proposed algorithm has several potential applications in the real world including legal document drafting, customer service chatbots, and content marketing.

Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) has become a prevalent specification language for robotic tasks. To mitigate the significant manual effort and expertise required to define LTL-encoded tasks, several methods have been proposed for translating Natural Language (NL) instructions into LTL formulas, which, however, lack correctness guarantees. To address this, we introduce a new NL-to-LTL translation method, called ConformalNL2LTL, that can achieve user-defined translation success rates over unseen NL commands. Our method constructs LTL formulas iteratively by addressing a sequence of open-vocabulary Question-Answering (QA) problems with LLMs. To enable uncertainty-aware translation, we leverage conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool for black-box models. CP enables our method to assess the uncertainty in LLM-generated answers, allowing it to proceed with translation when sufficiently confident and request help otherwise. We provide both theoretical and empirical results demonstrating that ConformalNL2LTL achieves user-specified translation accuracy while minimizing help rates.

<title>Param$\Delta$ for Direct Weight Mixing: Post-Train Large Language Model at Zero Cost</title>

Abstract: The post-training phase of large language models is essential for enhancing capabilities such as instruction-following, reasoning, and alignment with human preferences. However, it demands extensive high-quality data and poses risks like overfitting, alongside significant computational costs due to repeated post-training and evaluation after each base model update. This paper introduces $Param\Delta$, a novel method that streamlines post-training by transferring knowledge from an existing post-trained model to a newly updated base model with ZERO additional training. By computing the difference between post-trained model weights ($\Theta_\text{post}$) and base model weights ($\Theta_\text{base}$), and adding this to the updated base model ($\Theta'_\text{base}$), we define $Param\Delta$ Model as: $\Theta_{\text{Param}\Delta} = \Theta_\text{post} - \Theta_\text{base} + \Theta'_\text{base}$. This approach surprisingly equips the new base model with post-trained capabilities, achieving performance comparable to direct post-training. We did analysis on LLama3, Llama3.1, Qwen, and DeepSeek-distilled models. Results indicate $Param\Delta$ Model effectively replicates traditional post-training. For example, the $Param\Delta$ Model obtained from 70B Llama3-inst, Llama3-base, Llama3.1-base models attains approximately 95\% of Llama3.1-inst model's performance on average. $Param\Delta$ brings a new perspective on how to fully leverage models in the open-weight community, where checkpoints for base and instruct models are readily available and frequently updated, by providing a cost-free framework to accelerate the iterative cycle of model development.

<title>Creating and Evaluating Code-Mixed Nepali-English and Telugu-English Datasets for Abusive Language Detection Using Traditional and Deep Learning Models</title>

Abstract: With the growing presence of multilingual users on social media, detecting abusive language in code-mixed text has become increasingly challenging. Code-mixed communication, where users seamlessly switch between English and their native languages, poses difficulties for traditional abuse detection models, as offensive content may be context-dependent or obscured by linguistic blending. While abusive language detection has been extensively explored for high-resource languages like English and Hindi, low-resource languages such as Telugu and Nepali remain underrepresented, leaving gaps in effective moderation. In this study, we introduce a novel, manually annotated dataset of 2 thousand Telugu-English and 5 Nepali-English code-mixed comments, categorized as abusive and non-abusive, collected from various social media platforms. The dataset undergoes rigorous preprocessing before being evaluated across multiple Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Large Language Models (LLMs). We experimented with models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), LSTM, CNN, and LLMs, optimizing their performance through hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate it using 10-fold cross-validation and statistical significance testing (t-test). Our findings provide key insights into the challenges of detecting abusive language in code-mixed settings and offer a comparative analysis of computational approaches. This study contributes to advancing NLP for low-resource languages by establishing benchmarks for abusive language detection in Telugu-English and Nepali-English code-mixed text. The dataset and insights can aid in the development of more robust moderation strategies for multilingual social media environments.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of malware variants requires robust classification methods to enhance cybersecurity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for generating malware descriptions to aid family classification, their utility is limited by semantic embedding overlaps and misalignment with binary behavioral features. We propose a contrastive fine-tuning (CFT) method that refines LLM embeddings via targeted selection of hard negative samples based on cosine similarity, enabling LLMs to distinguish between closely related malware families. Our approach combines high-similarity negatives to enhance discriminative power and mid-tier negatives to increase embedding diversity, optimizing both precision and generalization. Evaluated on the CIC-AndMal-2020 and BODMAS datasets, our refined embeddings are integrated into a multimodal classifier within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework on a few-shot setting. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: our method achieves 63.15% classification accuracy with as few as 20 samples on CIC-AndMal-2020, outperforming baselines by 11--21 percentage points and surpassing prior negative sampling strategies. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of similarity-based selection over random sampling, with gains of 10-23%. Additionally, fine-tuned LLMs generate attribute-aware descriptions that generalize to unseen variants, bridging textual and binary feature gaps. This work advances malware classification by enabling nuanced semantic distinctions and provides a scalable framework for adapting LLMs to cybersecurity challenges.

Abstract: The perceived quality of the explanations accompanying e-government services is key to gaining trust in these institutions, consequently amplifying further usage of these services. Recent advances in generative AI, and concretely in Large Language Models (LLMs) allow the automation of such content articulations, eliciting explanations' interpretability and fidelity, and more generally, adapting content to various audiences. However, selecting the right LLM type for this has become a non-trivial task for e-government service providers. In this work, we adapted a previously developed scale to assist with this selection, providing a systematic approach for the comparative analysis of the perceived quality of explanations generated by various LLMs. We further demonstrated its applicability through the tax-return process, using it as an exemplar use case that could benefit from employing an LLM to generate explanations about tax refund decisions. This was attained through a user study with 128 survey respondents who were asked to rate different versions of LLM-generated explanations about tax refund decisions, providing a methodological basis for selecting the most appropriate LLM. Recognizing the practical challenges of conducting such a survey, we also began exploring the automation of this process by attempting to replicate human feedback using a selection of cutting-edge predictive techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly interact, collaborate, and delegate tasks to one another autonomously with minimal human interaction. Industry guidelines for agentic system governance emphasize the need for users to maintain comprehensive control over their agents, mitigating potential damage from malicious agents. Several proposed agentic system designs address agent identity, authorization, and delegation, but remain purely theoretical, without concrete implementation and evaluation. Most importantly, they do not provide user-controlled agent management. To address this gap, we propose SAGA, a Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, that offers user oversight over their agents' lifecycle. In our design, users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, that maintains agents contact information, user-defined access control policies, and helps agents enforce these policies on inter-agent communication. We introduce a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, that offers fine-grained control over an agent's interaction with other agents, balancing security and performance consideration. We evaluate SAGA on several agentic tasks, using agents in different geolocations, and multiple on-device and cloud LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance overhead with no impact on underlying task utility in a wide range of conditions. Our architecture enables secure and trustworthy deployment of autonomous agents, accelerating the responsible adoption of this technology in sensitive environments.

<title>A False Sense of Privacy: Evaluating Textual Data Sanitization Beyond Surface-level Privacy Leakage</title>

Abstract: Sanitizing sensitive text data typically involves removing personally identifiable information (PII) or generating synthetic data under the assumption that these methods adequately protect privacy; however, their effectiveness is often only assessed by measuring the leakage of explicit identifiers but ignoring nuanced textual markers that can lead to re-identification. We challenge the above illusion of privacy by proposing a new framework that evaluates re-identification attacks to quantify individual privacy risks upon data release. Our approach shows that seemingly innocuous auxiliary information -- such as routine social activities -- can be used to infer sensitive attributes like age or substance use history from sanitized data. For instance, we demonstrate that Azure's commercial PII removal tool fails to protect 74\% of information in the MedQA dataset. Although differential privacy mitigates these risks to some extent, it significantly reduces the utility of the sanitized text for downstream tasks. Our findings indicate that current sanitization techniques offer a \textit{false sense of privacy}, highlighting the need for more robust methods that protect against semantic-level information leakage.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has become an essential strategy for adapting them to specialized tasks; however, this process introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive training data may be inadvertently memorized and exposed. Although differential privacy (DP) offers strong theoretical guarantees against such leakage, its empirical privacy effectiveness on LLMs remains unclear, especially under different fine-tuning methods. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of DP across fine-tuning methods and privacy budgets, using both data extraction and membership inference attacks to assess empirical privacy risks. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Differential privacy reduces model utility, but its impact varies significantly across different fine-tuning methods. (2) Without DP, the privacy risks of models fine-tuned with different approaches differ considerably. (3) When DP is applied, even a relatively high privacy budget can substantially lower privacy risk. (4) The privacy-utility trade-off under DP training differs greatly among fine-tuning methods, with some methods being unsuitable for DP due to severe utility degradation. Our results provide practical guidance for privacy-conscious deployment of LLMs and pave the way for future research on optimizing the privacy-utility trade-off in fine-tuning methodologies.

Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified concerns about trustworthiness, including integrity, privacy, robustness, and bias. To assess and attribute these threats, we propose ConceptLens, a generic framework that leverages pre-trained multimodal models to identify the root causes of integrity threats by analyzing Concept Shift in probing samples. ConceptLens demonstrates strong detection performance for vanilla data poisoning attacks and uncovers vulnerabilities to bias injection, such as the generation of covert advertisements through malicious concept shifts. It identifies privacy risks in unaltered but high-risk samples, filters them before training, and provides insights into model weaknesses arising from incomplete or imbalanced training data. Additionally, at the model level, it attributes concepts that the target model is overly dependent on, identifies misleading concepts, and explains how disrupting key concepts negatively impacts the model. Furthermore, it uncovers sociological biases in generative content, revealing disparities across sociological contexts. Strikingly, ConceptLens reveals how safe training and inference data can be unintentionally and easily exploited, potentially undermining safety alignment. Our study informs actionable insights to breed trust in AI systems, thereby speeding adoption and driving greater innovation.

Abstract: The expansion of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has raised growing concerns about their potential to generate undesirable or harmful content, ranging from fabricated depictions of public figures to sexually explicit images. To mitigate these risks, prior work has devised machine unlearning techniques that attempt to erase unwanted concepts through fine-tuning. However, in this paper, we introduce a new threat model, Toxic Erasure (ToxE), and demonstrate how recent unlearning algorithms, including those explicitly designed for robustness, can be circumvented through targeted backdoor attacks. The threat is realized by establishing a link between a trigger and the undesired content. Subsequent unlearning attempts fail to erase this link, allowing adversaries to produce harmful content. We instantiate ToxE via two established backdoor attacks: one targeting the text encoder and another manipulating the cross-attention layers. Further, we introduce Deep Intervention Score-based Attack (DISA), a novel, deeper backdoor attack that optimizes the entire U-Net using a score-based objective, improving the attack's persistence across different erasure methods. We evaluate five recent concept erasure methods against our threat model. For celebrity identity erasure, our deep attack circumvents erasure with up to 82% success, averaging 57% across all erasure methods. For explicit content erasure, ToxE attacks can elicit up to 9 times more exposed body parts, with DISA yielding an average increase by a factor of 2.9. These results highlight a critical security gap in current unlearning strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated the capability to generate human like, natural responses across a range of tasks, including task oriented dialogue and question answering. However, their application in real world, critical scenarios is often hindered by a tendency to produce inaccurate information and a limited ability to leverage external knowledge sources. This paper introduces the LLM ENHANCER system, designed to integrate multiple online sources such as Google, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo to enhance data accuracy. The LLMs employed within this system are open source. The data acquisition process for the LLM ENHANCER system operates in parallel, utilizing custom agent tools to manage the flow of information. Vector embeddings are used to identify the most pertinent information, which is subsequently supplied to the LLM for user interaction. The LLM ENHANCER system mitigates hallucinations in chat based LLMs while preserving response naturalness and accuracy.

Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the promising variational approaches of quantum computing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In QAOA, variational parameters need to be optimized by solving a series of nonlinear, nonconvex optimization programs. In this work, we propose a QAOA parameter transfer scheme using Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to solve Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems. We prepare optimized parameters for graphs of 12 and 14 vertices and use GATs to transfer their parameters to larger graphs. Additionally, we design a hybrid distributed resource-aware algorithm for MIS (HyDRA-MIS), which decomposes large problems into smaller ones that can fit onto noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We integrate our GAT-based parameter transfer approach to HyDRA-MIS and demonstrate competitive results compared to KaMIS, a state-of-the-art classical MIS solver, on graphs with several thousands vertices.

Abstract: Continually retraining models has emerged as a primary technique to enable high-accuracy video analytics on edge devices. Yet, existing systems employ such adaptation by relying on the spare compute resources that traditional (memory-constrained) edge servers afford. In contrast, mobile edge devices such as drones and dashcams offer a fundamentally different resource profile: weak(er) compute with abundant unified memory pools. We present Legilimens, a continuous learning system for the mobile edge's System-on-Chip GPUs. Our driving insight is that visually distinct scenes that require retraining exhibit substantial overlap in model embeddings; if captured into a base model on device memory, specializing to each new scene can become lightweight, requiring very few samples. To practically realize this approach, Legilimens presents new, compute-efficient techniques to (1) select high-utility data samples for retraining specialized models, (2) update the base model without complete retraining, and (3) time-share compute resources between retraining and live inference for maximal accuracy. Across diverse workloads, Legilimens lowers retraining costs by 2.8-10x compared to existing systems, resulting in 18-45% higher accuracies.

Abstract: Privacy in federated learning is crucial, encompassing two key aspects: safeguarding the privacy of clients' data and maintaining the privacy of the federator's objective from the clients. While the first aspect has been extensively studied, the second has received much less attention.
  We present a novel approach that addresses both concerns simultaneously, drawing inspiration from techniques in knowledge distillation and private information retrieval to provide strong information-theoretic privacy guarantees.
  Traditional private function computation methods could be used here; however, they are typically limited to linear or polynomial functions. To overcome these constraints, our approach unfolds in three stages. In stage 0, clients perform the necessary computations locally. In stage 1, these results are shared among the clients, and in stage 2, the federator retrieves its desired objective without compromising the privacy of the clients' data. The crux of the method is a carefully designed protocol that combines secret-sharing-based multi-party computation and a graph-based private information retrieval scheme. We show that our method outperforms existing tools from the literature when properly adapted to this setting.

Abstract: This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the multi-class classification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.

<title>Small or Large? Zero-Shot or Finetuned? Guiding Language Model Choice for Specialized Applications in Healthcare</title>

Abstract: This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data. While LLMs offer strong zero-shot capabilities, their performance on these specific tasks did not match that of appropriately finetuned SLMs. In the era of LLMs, SLMs remain relevant and effective, offering a potentially superior performance-resource trade-off compared to LLMs.

Abstract: Extreme heat is the deadliest weather-related hazard in the United States. Furthermore, it is increasing in intensity, frequency, and duration, making skillful forecasts vital to protecting life and property. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models struggle with extreme heat for medium-range and subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence-based weather prediction (AIWP) models are progressing rapidly. However, it is largely unknown how well AIWP models forecast extremes, especially for medium-range and S2S timescales. This study investigates 2-m temperature forecasts for 60 heat waves across the four boreal seasons and over four CONUS regions at lead times up to 20 days, using two AIWP models (Google GraphCast and Pangu-Weather) and one traditional NWP model (NOAA United Forecast System Global Ensemble Forecast System (UFS GEFS)). First, case study analyses show that both AIWP models and the UFS GEFS exhibit consistent cold biases on regional scales in the 5-10 days of lead time before heat wave onset. GraphCast is the more skillful AIWP model, outperforming UFS GEFS and Pangu-Weather in most locations. Next, the two AIWP models are isolated and analyzed across all heat waves and seasons, with events split among the model's testing (2018-2023) and training (1979-2017) periods. There are cold biases before and during the heat waves in both models and all seasons, except Pangu-Weather in winter, which exhibits a mean warm bias before heat wave onset. Overall, results offer encouragement that AIWP models may be useful for medium-range and S2S predictability of extreme heat.

Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing tabular data from aggregate statistics, in which the attacker aims to identify interesting claims about the sensitive data that can be verified with 100% certainty given the aggregates. Successful attempts in prior work have conducted studies in settings where the set of published statistics is rich enough that entire datasets can be reconstructed with certainty. In our work, we instead focus on the regime where many possible datasets match the published statistics, making it impossible to reconstruct the entire private dataset perfectly (i.e., when approaches in prior work fail). We propose the problem of partial data reconstruction, in which the goal of the adversary is to instead output a $\textit{subset}$ of rows and/or columns that are $\textit{guaranteed to be correct}$. We introduce a novel integer programming approach that first $\textbf{generates}$ a set of claims and then $\textbf{verifies}$ whether each claim holds for all possible datasets consistent with the published aggregates. We evaluate our approach on the housing-level microdata from the U.S. Decennial Census release, demonstrating that privacy violations can still persist even when information published about such data is relatively sparse.

Abstract: Artefacts compromise clinical decision-making in the use of medical time series. Pulsatile waveforms offer probabilities for accurate artefact detection, yet most approaches rely on supervised manners and overlook patient-level distribution shifts. To address these issues, we introduce a generalised label-free framework, GenClean, for real-time artefact cleaning and leverage an in-house dataset of 180,000 ten-second arterial blood pressure (ABP) samples for training. We first investigate patient-level generalisation, demonstrating robust performances under both intra- and inter-patient distribution shifts. We further validate its effectiveness through challenging cross-disease cohort experiments on the MIMIC-III database. Additionally, we extend our method to photoplethysmography (PPG), highlighting its applicability to diverse medical pulsatile signals. Finally, its integration into ICM+, a clinical research monitoring software, confirms the real-time feasibility of our framework, emphasising its practical utility in continuous physiological monitoring. This work provides a foundational step toward precision medicine in improving the reliability of high-resolution medical time series analysis

Abstract: Deep learning models have great potential in medical imaging, including orthodontics and skeletal maturity assessment. However, applying a model to data different from its training set can lead to unreliable predictions that may impact patient care. To address this, we propose a comprehensive verification framework that evaluates model suitability through multiple complementary strategies. First, we introduce a Gradient Attention Map (GAM)-based approach that analyzes attention patterns using Grad-CAM and compares them via similarity metrics such as IoU, Dice Similarity, SSIM, Cosine Similarity, Pearson Correlation, KL Divergence, and Wasserstein Distance. Second, we extend verification to early convolutional feature maps, capturing structural mis-alignments missed by attention alone. Finally, we incorporate an additional garbage class into the classification model to explicitly reject out-of-distribution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that these combined methods effectively identify unsuitable models and inputs, promoting safer and more reliable deployment of deep learning in medical imaging.

<title>T2ID-CAS: Diffusion Model and Class Aware Sampling to Mitigate Class Imbalance in Neck Ultrasound Anatomical Landmark Detection</title>

Abstract: Neck ultrasound (US) plays a vital role in airway management by providing non-invasive, real-time imaging that enables rapid and precise interventions. Deep learning-based anatomical landmark detection in neck US can further facilitate procedural efficiency. However, class imbalance within datasets, where key structures like tracheal rings and vocal folds are underrepresented, presents significant challenges for object detection models. To address this, we propose T2ID-CAS, a hybrid approach that combines a text-to-image latent diffusion model with class-aware sampling to generate high-quality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes. This approach, rarely explored in the ultrasound domain, improves the representation of minority classes. Experimental results using YOLOv9 for anatomical landmark detection in neck US demonstrated that T2ID-CAS achieved a mean Average Precision of 88.2, significantly surpassing the baseline of 66. This highlights its potential as a computationally efficient and scalable solution for mitigating class imbalance in AI-assisted ultrasound-guided interventions.

Abstract: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is activated during stress, which can have negative effects on cardiovascular health, sleep, the immune system, and mental health. While there are ways to quantify ANS activity in laboratories, there is a paucity of methods that have been validated in real-world contexts. We present the Fitbit Body Response Algorithm, an approach to continuous remote measurement of ANS activation through widely available remote wrist-based sensors. The design was validated via two experiments, a Trier Social Stress Test (n = 45) and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of perceived stress (n=87), providing both controlled and ecologically valid test data. Model performance predicting perceived stress when using all available sensor modalities was consistent with expectations (accuracy=0.85) and outperformed models with access to only a subset of the signals. We discuss and address challenges to sensing that arise in real world settings that do not present in conventional lab environments.

Abstract: Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations offer high-fidelity modeling of airflow for building HVAC design, their high computational cost makes them impractical for practical adoption in real-time building management system. In this work, we present a data-driven framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable energy-efficient building ventilation control. Our method jointly optimizes airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train a neural operator transformer to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow field distributions using high-resolution CFD data. This learned operator enables a gradient-based control framework capable of optimal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, and data-driven control based on regional average CO2 predictions, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method for enabling safe and energy-efficient building management.

Abstract: Accurate imputation of race and ethnicity (R&amp;E) is crucial for analyzing disparities and informing policy. Methods like Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) are widely used but exhibit limitations, including systematic misclassification biases linked to socioeconomic status. This paper introduces LSTM+Geo, a novel approach enhancing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with census tract geolocation information. Using a large voter dataset, we demonstrate that LSTM+Geo (88.7% accuracy) significantly outperforms standalone LSTM (86.4%) and Bayesian methods like BISG (82.9%) and BIFSG (86.8%) in accuracy and F1-score on a held-out validation set. LSTM+Geo reduces the rate at which non-White individuals are misclassified as White (White FPR 19.3%) compared to name-only LSTMs (White FPR 24.6%). While sophisticated ensemble methods incorporating XGBoost achieve the highest overall accuracy (up to 89.4%) and lowest White FPR (17.8%), LSTM+Geo offers strong standalone performance with improved bias characteristics compared to baseline models. Integrating LSTM+Geo into an XGBoost ensemble further boosts accuracy, highlighting its utility as both a standalone model and a component for advanced systems. We give a caution at the end regarding the appropriate use of these methods.

<title>Power Flow Approximations for Multiphase Distribution Networks using Gaussian Processes</title>

Abstract: Learning-based approaches are increasingly leveraged to manage and coordinate the operation of grid-edge resources in active power distribution networks. Among these, model-based techniques stand out for their superior data efficiency and robustness compared to model-free methods. However, effective model learning requires a learning-based approximator for the underlying power flow model. This study extends existing work by introducing a data-driven power flow method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to approximate the multiphase power flow model, by mapping net load injections to nodal voltages. Simulation results using the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node distribution test feeders demonstrate that the trained GP model can reliably predict the nonlinear power flow solutions with minimal training data. We also conduct a comparative analysis of the training efficiency and testing performance of the proposed GP-based power flow approximator against a deep neural network-based approximator, highlighting the advantages of our data-efficient approach. Results over realistic operating conditions show that despite an 85% reduction in the training sample size (corresponding to a 92.8% improvement in training time), GP models produce a 99.9% relative reduction in mean absolute error compared to the baselines of deep neural networks.

<title>Embracing Collaboration Over Competition: Condensing Multiple Prompts for Visual In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) enables adaptively solving vision tasks by leveraging pixel demonstrations, mimicking human-like task completion through analogy. Prompt selection is critical in VICL, but current methods assume the existence of a single "ideal" prompt in a pool of candidates, which in practice may not hold true. Multiple suitable prompts may exist, but individually they often fall short, leading to difficulties in selection and the exclusion of useful context. To address this, we propose a new perspective: prompt condensation. Rather than relying on a single prompt, candidate prompts collaborate to efficiently integrate informative contexts without sacrificing resolution. We devise Condenser, a lightweight external plugin that compresses relevant fine-grained context across multiple prompts. Optimized end-to-end with the backbone, Condenser ensures accurate integration of contextual cues. Experiments demonstrate Condenser outperforms state-of-the-arts across benchmark tasks, showing superior context compression, scalability with more prompts, and enhanced computational efficiency compared to ensemble methods, positioning it as a highly competitive solution for VICL. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/gimpong/CVPR25-Condenser.

<title>Redundancy Analysis and Mitigation for Machine Learning-Based Process Monitoring of Additive Manufacturing</title>

Abstract: The deployment of machine learning (ML)-based process monitoring systems has significantly advanced additive manufacturing (AM) by enabling real-time defect detection, quality assessment, and process optimization. However, redundancy is a critical yet often overlooked challenge in the deployment and operation of ML-based AM process monitoring systems. Excessive redundancy leads to increased equipment costs, compromised model performance, and high computational requirements, posing barriers to industrial adoption. However, existing research lacks a unified definition of redundancy and a systematic framework for its evaluation and mitigation. This paper defines redundancy in ML-based AM process monitoring and categorizes it into sample-level, feature-level, and model-level redundancy. A comprehensive multi-level redundancy mitigation (MLRM) framework is proposed, incorporating advanced methods such as data registration, downscaling, cross-modality knowledge transfer, and model pruning to systematically reduce redundancy while improving model performance. The framework is validated through an ML-based in-situ defect detection case study for directed energy deposition (DED), demonstrating a 91% reduction in latency, a 47% decrease in error rate, and a 99.4% reduction in storage requirements. Additionally, the proposed approach lowers sensor costs and energy consumption, enabling a lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring system. By defining redundancy and introducing a structured mitigation framework, this study establishes redundancy analysis and mitigation as a key enabler of efficient ML-based process monitoring in production environments.

<title>How to Backdoor the Knowledge Distillation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has become a cornerstone in modern machine learning systems, celebrated for its ability to transfer knowledge from a large, complex teacher model to a more efficient student model. Traditionally, this process is regarded as secure, assuming the teacher model is clean. This belief stems from conventional backdoor attacks relying on poisoned training data with backdoor triggers and attacker-chosen labels, which are not involved in the distillation process. Instead, knowledge distillation uses the outputs of a clean teacher model to guide the student model, inherently preventing recognition or response to backdoor triggers as intended by an attacker. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by introducing a novel attack methodology that strategically poisons the distillation dataset with adversarial examples embedded with backdoor triggers. This technique allows for the stealthy compromise of the student model while maintaining the integrity of the teacher model. Our innovative approach represents the first successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within the knowledge distillation process using clean teacher models. Through extensive experiments conducted across various datasets and attack settings, we demonstrate the robustness, stealthiness, and effectiveness of our method. Our findings reveal previously unrecognized vulnerabilities and pave the way for future research aimed at securing knowledge distillation processes against backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Black-box discrete optimization (BB-DO) problems arise in many real-world applications, such as neural architecture search and mathematical model estimation. A key challenge in BB-DO is epistasis among parameters where multiple variables must be modified simultaneously to effectively improve the objective function. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) provide a powerful framework for tackling BB-DO problems. In particular, an EDA leveraging a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has demonstrated strong performance on relatively low-dimensional problems with epistasis while reducing computational cost. Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms such as DSMGA-II and P3, which integrate bit-flip-based local search with linkage learning, have shown excellent performance on high-dimensional problems. In this study, we propose a new memetic algorithm that combines VAE-based sampling with local search. The proposed method inherits the strengths of both VAE-based EDAs and local search-based approaches: it effectively handles high-dimensional problems with epistasis among parameters without incurring excessive computational overhead. Experiments on NK landscapes -- a challenging benchmark for BB-DO involving epistasis among parameters -- demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art VAE-based EDA methods, as well as leading approaches such as P3 and DSMGA-II.

Abstract: We introduce kernel density machines (KDM), a novel density ratio estimator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space setting. KDM applies to general probability measures on countably generated measurable spaces without restrictive assumptions on continuity, or the existence of a Lebesgue density. For computational efficiency, we incorporate a low-rank approximation with precisely controlled error that grants scalability to large-sample settings. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including asymptotic consistency, a functional central limit theorem, and finite-sample error bounds, establishing a strong foundation for practical use. Empirical results based on simulated and real data demonstrate the efficacy and precision of KDM.

Abstract: Economically responsible mitigation of multivariate extreme risks -- extreme rainfall in a large area, huge variations of many stock prices, widespread breakdowns in transportation systems -- requires estimates of the probabilities that such risks will materialize in the future. This paper develops a new method, Wasserstein--Aitchison Generative Adversarial Networks (WA-GAN), which provides simulated values of future $d$-dimensional multivariate extreme events and which hence can be used to give estimates of such probabilities. The main hypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto scale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the distributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the $L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets large. The method is a combination of standard extreme value analysis modeling of the tails of the marginal distributions with nonparametric GAN modeling of the angular distribution. For the latter, the angular values are transformed to Aitchison coordinates in a full $(d-1)$-dimensional linear space, and a Wasserstein GAN is trained on these coordinates and used to generate new values. A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives simulated values on the original data scale. The method shows good performance compared to other existing methods in the literature, both in terms of capturing the dependence structure of the extremes in the data, as well as in generating accurate new extremes of the data distribution. The comparison is performed on simulated multivariate extremes from a logistic model in dimensions up to 50 and on a 30-dimensional financial data set.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical gap in Arabic natural language processing by developing an effective Arabic Reverse Dictionary (RD) system that enables users to find words based on their descriptions or meanings. We present a novel transformer-based approach with a semi-encoder neural network architecture featuring geometrically decreasing layers that achieves state-of-the-art results for Arabic RD tasks. Our methodology incorporates a comprehensive dataset construction process and establishes formal quality standards for Arabic lexicographic definitions. Experiments with various pre-trained models demonstrate that Arabic-specific models significantly outperform general multilingual embeddings, with ARBERTv2 achieving the best ranking score (0.0644). Additionally, we provide a formal abstraction of the reverse dictionary task that enhances theoretical understanding and develop a modular, extensible Python library (RDTL) with configurable training pipelines. Our analysis of dataset quality reveals important insights for improving Arabic definition construction, leading to eight specific standards for building high-quality reverse dictionary resources. This work contributes significantly to Arabic computational linguistics and provides valuable tools for language learning, academic writing, and professional communication in Arabic.

<title>ClassWise-CRF: Category-Specific Fusion for Enhanced Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery</title>

Abstract: We propose a result-level category-specific fusion architecture called ClassWise-CRF. This architecture employs a two-stage process: first, it selects expert networks that perform well in specific categories from a pool of candidate networks using a greedy algorithm; second, it integrates the segmentation predictions of these selected networks by adaptively weighting their contributions based on their segmentation performance in each category. Inspired by Conditional Random Field (CRF), the ClassWise-CRF architecture treats the segmentation predictions from multiple networks as confidence vector fields. It leverages segmentation metrics (such as Intersection over Union) from the validation set as priors and employs an exponential weighting strategy to fuse the category-specific confidence scores predicted by each network. This fusion method dynamically adjusts the weights of each network for different categories, achieving category-specific optimization. Building on this, the architecture further optimizes the fused results using unary and pairwise potentials in CRF to ensure spatial consistency and boundary accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of ClassWise-CRF, we conducted experiments on two remote sensing datasets, LoveDA and Vaihingen, using eight classic and advanced semantic segmentation networks. The results show that the ClassWise-CRF architecture significantly improves segmentation performance: on the LoveDA dataset, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric increased by 1.00% on the validation set and by 0.68% on the test set; on the Vaihingen dataset, the mIoU improved by 0.87% on the validation set and by 0.91% on the test set. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the ClassWise-CRF architecture in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.

Abstract: With the recent development of new geometric and angular-radial frameworks for multivariate extremes, reliably simulating from angular variables in moderate-to-high dimensions is of increasing importance. Empirical approaches have the benefit of simplicity, and work reasonably well in low dimensions, but as the number of variables increases, they can lack the required flexibility and scalability. Classical parametric models for angular variables, such as the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, provide an alternative. Exploiting mixtures of vMF distributions increases their flexibility, but there are cases where even this is not sufficient to capture the intricate features that can arise in data. Owing to their flexibility, generative deep learning methods are able to capture complex data structures; they therefore have the potential to be useful in the simulation of angular variables. In this paper, we explore a range of deep learning approaches for this task, including generative adversarial networks, normalizing flows and flow matching. We assess their performance via a range of metrics and make comparisons to the more classical approach of using a mixture of vMF distributions. The methods are also applied to a metocean data set, demonstrating their applicability to real-world, complex data structures.

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GP) are a versatile tool in machine learning and computational science. We here consider the case of multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP) and present low-rank approaches for efficiently computing the posterior mean of a MOGP. Starting from low-rank spatio-temporal data we consider a structured covariance function, assuming separability across space and time. This separability, in turn, gives a decomposition of the covariance matrix into a Kronecker product of individual covariance matrices. Incorporating the typical noise term to the model then requires the solution of a large-scale Stein equation for computing the posterior mean. For this, we propose efficient low-rank methods based on a combination of a LRPCG method with the Sylvester equation solver KPIK adjusted for solving Stein equations. We test the developed method on real world street network graphs by using graph filters as covariance matrices. Moreover, we propose a degree-weighted average covariance matrix, which can be employed under specific assumptions to achieve more efficient convergence.

Abstract: In recent studies, numerous previous works emphasize the importance of semantic segmentation of LiDAR data as a critical component to the development of driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. However, many state-of-the-art methods are tested on outdated, lower-resolution LiDAR sensors and struggle with real-time constraints. This study introduces a novel semantic segmentation framework tailored for modern high-resolution LiDAR sensors that addresses both accuracy and real-time processing demands. We propose a novel LiDAR dataset collected by a cutting-edge automotive 128 layer LiDAR in urban traffic scenes. Furthermore, we propose a semantic segmentation method utilizing surface normals as strong input features. Our approach is bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical automotive applications. Additionaly, we provide a Robot Operating System (ROS2) implementation that we operate on our research vehicle. Our dataset and code are publicly available: https://github.com/kav-institute/SemanticLiDAR.

<title>Quantitative Auditing of AI Fairness with Differentially Private Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: Fairness auditing of AI systems can identify and quantify biases. However, traditional auditing using real-world data raises security and privacy concerns. It exposes auditors to security risks as they become custodians of sensitive information and targets for cyberattacks. Privacy risks arise even without direct breaches, as data analyses can inadvertently expose confidential information. To address these, we propose a framework that leverages differentially private synthetic data to audit the fairness of AI systems. By applying privacy-preserving mechanisms, it generates synthetic data that mirrors the statistical properties of the original dataset while ensuring privacy. This method balances the goal of rigorous fairness auditing and the need for strong privacy protections. Through experiments on real datasets like Adult, COMPAS, and Diabetes, we compare fairness metrics of synthetic and real data. By analyzing the alignment and discrepancies between these metrics, we assess the capacity of synthetic data to preserve the fairness properties of real data. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to enable meaningful fairness evaluations while safeguarding sensitive information, proving its applicability across critical and sensitive domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve accuracy by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, recent research has revealed RAG's susceptibility to poisoning attacks, where the attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database, leading to attacker-desired responses. Existing defenses, which predominantly focus on inference-time mitigation, have proven insufficient against sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we introduce RAGForensics, the first traceback system for RAG, designed to identify poisoned texts within the knowledge database that are responsible for the attacks. RAGForensics operates iteratively, first retrieving a subset of texts from the database and then utilizing a specially crafted prompt to guide an LLM in detecting potential poisoning texts. Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGForensics against state-of-the-art poisoning attacks. This work pioneers the traceback of poisoned texts in RAG systems, providing a practical and promising defense mechanism to enhance their security.

Abstract: Large Language Models are fundamental actors in the modern IT landscape dominated by AI solutions. However, security threats associated with them might prevent their reliable adoption in critical application scenarios such as government organizations and medical institutions. For this reason, commercial LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any harmful output they could possibly produce. In response to this, LLM Jailbreaking is a significant threat to such protections, and many previous approaches have already demonstrated its effectiveness across diverse domains. Existing jailbreak proposals mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and design a targeted jailbreak attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive unique exploitable alignment patterns. Then, we propose XBreaking, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits these unique patterns to break the security constraints of LLMs by targeted noise injection. Our thorough experimental campaign returns important insights about the censoring mechanisms and demonstrates the effectiveness and performance of our attack.

<title>Cert-SSB: Toward Certified Sample-Specific Backdoor Defense</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an attacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden backdoors into the model. The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary. However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.

<title>Estimation of discrete distributions in relative entropy, and the deviations of the missing mass</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a distribution over a finite alphabet from an i.i.d. sample, with accuracy measured in relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence). While optimal expected risk bounds are known, high-probability guarantees remain less well-understood. First, we analyze the classical Laplace (add-$1$) estimator, obtaining matching upper and lower bounds on its performance and showing its optimality among confidence-independent estimators. We then characterize the minimax-optimal high-probability risk achievable by any estimator, which is attained via a simple confidence-dependent smoothing technique. Interestingly, the optimal non-asymptotic risk contains an additional logarithmic factor over the ideal asymptotic risk. Next, motivated by scenarios where the alphabet exceeds the sample size, we investigate methods that adapt to the sparsity of the distribution at hand. We introduce an estimator using data-dependent smoothing, for which we establish a high-probability risk bound depending on two effective sparsity parameters. As part of the analysis, we also derive a sharp high-probability upper bound on the missing mass.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in identifying clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), yet automated methods face challenges such as data imbalance, variable tumor sizes, and a lack of annotated data. This study introduces Anomaly-Driven U-Net (adU-Net), which incorporates anomaly maps derived from biparametric MRI sequences into a deep learning-based segmentation framework to improve csPCa identification. We conduct a comparative analysis of anomaly detection methods and evaluate the integration of anomaly maps into the segmentation pipeline. Anomaly maps, generated using Fixed-Point GAN reconstruction, highlight deviations from normal prostate tissue, guiding the segmentation model to potential cancerous regions. We compare the performance by using the average score, computed as the mean of the AUROC and Average Precision (AP). On the external test set, adU-Net achieves the best average score of 0.618, outperforming the baseline nnU-Net model (0.605). The results demonstrate that incorporating anomaly detection into segmentation improves generalization and performance, particularly with ADC-based anomaly maps, offering a promising direction for automated csPCa identification.

<title>Balancing Interpretability and Flexibility in Modeling Diagnostic Trajectories with an Embedded Neural Hawkes Process Model</title>

Abstract: The Hawkes process (HP) is commonly used to model event sequences with self-reinforcing dynamics, including electronic health records (EHRs). Traditional HPs capture self-reinforcement via parametric impact functions that can be inspected to understand how each event modulates the intensity of others. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in improved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability, which is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and improve upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact functions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a neural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale event sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than traditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches, and allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding transformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings. Results show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in simulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset, and gains clinically meaningful interpretation on XX-EHR with children diagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our flexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be maintained without loss of performance.

Abstract: The growing luminosity frontier at the Large Hadron Collider is challenging the reconstruction and analysis of particle collision events. Increased particle multiplicities are straining latency and storage requirements at the data acquisition stage, while new complications are emerging, including higher background levels and more frequent particle vertex misassociations. This in turn necessitates the development of more holistic and scalable reconstruction methods that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. We propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture featuring unique representations for diverse particle collision relationships and integrated graph pruning layers for scalability. Trained with a multi-task paradigm in an environment mimicking the LHCb experiment, this HGNN significantly improves beauty hadron reconstruction performance. Notably, it concurrently performs particle vertex association and graph pruning within a single framework. We quantify reconstruction and pruning performance, demonstrate enhanced inference time scaling with event complexity, and mitigate potential performance loss using a weighted message passing scheme.

Abstract: The majority of biomedical studies use limited datasets that may not generalize over large heterogeneous datasets that have been collected over several decades. The current paper develops and validates several multimodal models that can predict 1-year mortality based on a massive clinical dataset. Our focus on predicting 1-year mortality can provide a sense of urgency to the patients. Using the largest dataset of its kind, the paper considers the development and validation of multimodal models based on 25,137,015 videos associated with 699,822 echocardiography studies from 316,125 patients, and 2,922,990 8-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) traces from 631,353 patients. Our models allow us to assess the contribution of individual factors and modalities to the overall risk. Our approach allows us to develop extremely low-parameter models that use optimized feature selection based on feature importance. Based on available clinical information, we construct a family of models that are made available in the DISIML package. Overall, performance ranges from an AUC of 0.72 with just ten parameters to an AUC of 0.89 with under 105k for the full multimodal model. The proposed approach represents a modular neural network framework that can provide insights into global risk trends and guide therapies for reducing mortality risk.

Abstract: The variability of wind power supply can present substantial challenges to incorporating wind power into a grid system. Thus, Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration and operation. There has been an explosion of studies on wind power forecasting problems in the past decades. Nevertheless, how to well handle the WPF problem is still challenging, since high prediction accuracy is always demanded to ensure grid stability and security of supply. We present a unique Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting dataset: SDWPF, which includes the spatial distribution of wind turbines, as well as the dynamic context factors. Whereas, most of the existing datasets have only a small number of wind turbines without knowing the locations and context information of wind turbines at a fine-grained time scale. By contrast, SDWPF provides the wind power data of 134 wind turbines from a wind farm over half a year with their relative positions and internal statuses. We use this dataset to launch the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 to examine the limit of current WPF solutions. The dataset is released at https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/152/0/datasets.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019) resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions, and highlights its potential to identify opportunities for emission reduction.

Abstract: Video games have served as useful benchmarks for the decision-making community, but going beyond Atari games towards modern games has been prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the research community. Prior work in modern video games typically relied on game-specific integration to obtain game features and enable online training, or on existing large datasets. An alternative approach is to train agents using imitation learning to play video games purely from images. However, this setting poses a fundamental question: which visual encoders obtain representations that retain information critical for decision making? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic study of imitation learning with publicly available pre-trained visual encoders compared to the typical task-specific end-to-end training approach in Minecraft, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Minecraft Dungeons. Our results show that end-to-end training can be effective with comparably low-resolution images and only minutes of demonstrations, but significant improvements can be gained by utilising pre-trained encoders such as DINOv2 depending on the game. In addition to enabling effective decision making, we show that pre-trained encoders can make decision-making research in video games more accessible by significantly reducing the cost of training.

Abstract: The excessive computational requirements of modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) are posing limitations on the machines that can run them. Sparsification of ANNs is often motivated by time, memory and energy savings only during model inference, yielding no benefits during training. A growing body of work is now focusing on providing the benefits of model sparsification also during training. While these methods greatly improve the training efficiency, the training algorithms yielding the most accurate models still materialize the dense weights, or compute dense gradients during training. We propose an efficient, always-sparse training algorithm with excellent scaling to larger and sparser models, supported by its linear time complexity with respect to the model width during training and inference. Moreover, our guided stochastic exploration algorithm improves over the accuracy of previous sparse training methods. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and ViT models, and compare it against a range of sparsification methods.

Abstract: We present algorithms that substantially accelerate partition-based cross-validation for machine learning models that require matrix products $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. Our algorithms have applications in model selection for, for example, principal component analysis (PCA), principal component regression (PCR), ridge regression (RR), ordinary least squares (OLS), and partial least squares (PLS). Our algorithms support all combinations of column-wise centering and scaling of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$, and we demonstrate in our accompanying implementation that this adds only a manageable, practical constant over efficient variants without preprocessing. We prove the correctness of our algorithms under a fold-based partitioning scheme and show that the running time is independent of the number of folds; that is, they have the same time complexity as that of computing $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$ and space complexity equivalent to storing $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{Y}$, $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$, and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. Importantly, unlike alternatives found in the literature, we avoid data leakage due to preprocessing. We achieve these results by eliminating redundant computations in the overlap between training partitions. Concretely, we show how to manipulate $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$ using only samples from the validation partition to obtain the preprocessed training partition-wise $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. To our knowledge, we are the first to derive correct and efficient cross-validation algorithms for any of the $16$ combinations of column-wise centering and scaling, for which we also prove only $12$ give distinct matrix products.

Abstract: Our understanding of the generalization capabilities of neural networks (NNs) is still incomplete. Prevailing explanations are based on implicit biases of gradient descent (GD) but they cannot account for the capabilities of models from gradient-free methods nor the simplicity bias recently observed in untrained networks. This paper seeks other sources of generalization in NNs.
  Findings. To understand the inductive biases provided by architectures independently from GD, we examine untrained, random-weight networks. Even simple MLPs show strong inductive biases: uniform sampling in weight space yields a very biased distribution of functions in terms of complexity. But unlike common wisdom, NNs do not have an inherent "simplicity bias". This property depends on components such as ReLUs, residual connections, and layer normalizations. Alternative architectures can be built with a bias for any level of complexity. Transformers also inherit all these properties from their building blocks.
  Implications. We provide a fresh explanation for the success of deep learning independent from gradient-based training. It points at promising avenues for controlling the solutions implemented by trained models.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning focuses on predicting events through historical information within snapshots distributed on a timeline. Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of I) investigating the impact of multi-granular interactions across recent snapshots, and II) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, particularly events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring (HisRES). Concretely, HisRES comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, HisRES incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HisRES and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.

Abstract: Skills are effective temporal abstractions established for sequential decision making, which enable efficient hierarchical learning for long-horizon tasks and facilitate multi-task learning through their transferability. Despite extensive research, research gaps remain in multi-agent scenarios, particularly for automatically extracting subgroup coordination patterns in a multi-agent task. In this case, we propose two novel auto-encoder schemes: VO-MASD-3D and VO-MASD-Hier, to simultaneously capture subgroup- and temporal-level abstractions and form multi-agent skills, which firstly solves the aforementioned challenge. An essential algorithm component of these schemes is a dynamic grouping function that can automatically detect latent subgroups based on agent interactions in a task. Further, our method can be applied to offline multi-task data, and the discovered subgroup skills can be transferred across relevant tasks without retraining. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft tasks indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods. Moreover, skills discovered using our method can effectively reduce the learning difficulty in MARL scenarios with delayed and sparse reward signals.

Abstract: Fairness-aware domain generalization (FairDG) has emerged as a critical challenge for deploying trustworthy AI systems, particularly in scenarios involving distribution shifts. Traditional methods for addressing fairness have failed in domain generalization due to their lack of consideration for distribution shifts. Although disentanglement has been used to tackle FairDG, it is limited by its strong assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Fairness-aware Classifier-Guided Score-based Diffusion Models (FADE) as a novel approach to effectively address the FairDG issue. Specifically, we first pre-train a score-based diffusion model (SDM) and two classifiers to equip the model with strong generalization capabilities across different domains. Then, we guide the SDM using these pre-trained classifiers to effectively eliminate sensitive information from the generated data. Finally, the generated fair data is used to train downstream classifiers, ensuring robust performance under new data distributions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FADE not only enhances fairness but also improves accuracy in the presence of distribution shifts. Additionally, FADE outperforms existing methods in achieving the best accuracy-fairness trade-offs.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in a Federated Learning (FL) system, i.e., a satisfactory performance for all of the participating diverse clients, is an important and challenging problem. There are multiple fair FL algorithms in the literature, which have been relatively successful in providing fairness. However, these algorithms mostly emphasize on the loss functions of worst-off clients to improve their performance, which often results in the suppression of well-performing ones. As a consequence, they usually sacrifice the system's overall average performance for achieving fairness. Motivated by this and inspired by two well-known risk modeling methods in Finance, Mean-Variance and Mean-Semi-Variance, we propose and study two new fair FL algorithms, Variance Reduction (VRed) and Semi-Variance Reduction (SemiVRed). VRed encourages equality between clients' loss functions by penalizing their variance. In contrast, SemiVRed penalizes the discrepancy of only the worst-off clients' loss functions from the average loss. Through extensive experiments on multiple vision and language datasets, we show that, SemiVRed achieves SoTA performance in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions and improves both fairness and system overall average performance.

Abstract: We present a novel method, Contextual goal-Oriented Data Augmentation (CODA), which uses commonly available unlabeled trajectories and context-goal pairs to solve Contextual Goal-Oriented (CGO) problems. By carefully constructing an action-augmented MDP that is equivalent to the original MDP, CODA creates a fully labeled transition dataset under training contexts without additional approximation error. We conduct a novel theoretical analysis to demonstrate CODA's capability to solve CGO problems in the offline data setup. Empirical results also showcase the effectiveness of CODA, which outperforms other baseline methods across various context-goal relationships of CGO problem. This approach offers a promising direction to solving CGO problems using offline datasets.

Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.

<title>Estimating Wage Disparities Using Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: The rise of foundation models marks a paradigm shift in machine learning: instead of training specialized models from scratch, foundation models are first trained on massive datasets before being adapted or fine-tuned to make predictions on smaller datasets. Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is only fine-tuned to maximize predictive accuracy. We then provide a novel set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are root-n-consistent. Based on this theory, we develop new fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage decomposition. This is a statistical estimation problem from econometrics where the goal is to decompose the gender wage gap into components that can and cannot be explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on coarse summaries of career history that may omit factors that are important for explaining the gap. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model to decompose the gender wage gap, which captures a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the wage gap.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that Transformers trained from scratch can successfully solve various arithmetic and algorithmic tasks, such as adding numbers and computing parity. While these Transformers generalize well on unseen inputs of the same length, they struggle with length generalization, i.e., handling inputs of unseen lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that looped Transformers with an adaptive number of steps significantly improve length generalization. We focus on tasks with a known iterative solution, involving multiple iterations of a RASP-L operation - a length-generalizable operation that can be expressed by a finite-sized Transformer. We train looped Transformers using our proposed learning algorithm and observe that they learn highly length-generalizable solutions for various tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events necessitates both high-resolution products (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical records (to capture rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide kilometer-scale precipitation fields, but with limited historical records and geographical coverage. Conversely, global gauge and blended products span decades, yet their coarse 30-50 km grids obscure local extremes. This work introduces Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a generative downscaling framework that integrates diffusion modeling with a distribution-matching (Wasserstein) regularizer, suppressing bias throughout the entire generative denoising process. Conditioned on 55 km CPC gauge-based precipitation and the 31 km ERA5 reanalysis, WassDiff generates 1 km precipitation estimates that remain well-calibrated to targets across the full intensity range, including the extremes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art downscaling methods, delivering lower reconstruction error and reduced bias. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale structures and accurate peak intensities from extreme weather phenomena, such as tropical storms and cold fronts. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.

Abstract: A major challenge for transformers is generalizing to sequences longer than those observed during training. While previous works have empirically shown that transformers can either succeed or fail at length generalization depending on the task, theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this work, we introduce a rigorous theoretical framework to analyze length generalization in causal transformers with learnable absolute positional encodings. In particular, we characterize those functions that are identifiable in the limit from sufficiently long inputs with absolute positional encodings under an idealized inference scheme using a norm-based regularizer. This enables us to prove the possibility of length generalization for a rich family of problems. We experimentally validate the theory as a predictor of success and failure of length generalization across a range of algorithmic and formal language tasks. Our theory not only explains a broad set of empirical observations but also opens the way to provably predicting length generalization capabilities in transformers.

Abstract: Classical assumptions like strong convexity and Lipschitz smoothness often fail to capture the nature of deep learning optimization problems, which are typically non-convex and non-smooth, making traditional analyses less applicable. This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms of non-convex optimization in deep learning by extending the conventional notions of strong convexity and Lipschitz smoothness. By leveraging these concepts, we prove that, under the established constraints, the empirical risk minimization problem is equivalent to optimizing the local gradient norm and structural error, which together constitute the upper and lower bounds of the empirical risk. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm can effectively minimize the local gradient norm. Additionally, techniques like skip connections, over-parameterization, and random parameter initialization are shown to help control the structural error. Ultimately, we validate the core conclusions of this paper through extensive experiments. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of non-convex optimization in deep learning.

Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced adaptive random Fourier features (ARFF) training algorithm for shallow neural networks, building upon the work introduced in "Adaptive Random Fourier Features with Metropolis Sampling", Kammonen et al., \emph{Foundations of Data Science}, 2(3):309--332, 2020. This improved method uses a particle filter-type resampling technique to stabilize the training process and reduce the sensitivity to parameter choices. The Metropolis test can also be omitted when resampling is used, reducing the number of hyperparameters by one and reducing the computational cost per iteration compared to the ARFF method. We present comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in function regression tasks as a stand-alone method and as a pretraining step before gradient-based optimization, using the Adam optimizer. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to a simple image regression problem, illustrating its utility in sampling frequencies for the random Fourier features (RFF) layer of coordinate-based multilayer perceptrons. In this context, we use the proposed algorithm to sample the parameters of the RFF layer in an automated manner.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain. Our results highlight the versatility and efficacy of the MaskGIT dynamics prior, paving the way for more accurate world models and effective RL policies.

Abstract: Liver cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and accurate Computed Tomography (CT)-based tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment. Manual delineation is time-intensive, prone to variability, and highlights the need for reliable automation. While deep learning has shown promise for automated liver segmentation, precise liver tumor segmentation remains challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumors, imprecise tumor margins, and limited labeled data. We present SmoothSegNet, a novel deep learning framework that addresses these challenges with the three key designs: (1) A novel knowledge-informed label smoothing technique that distills knowledge from clinical data to generate smooth labels, which are used to regularize model training, reducing the overfitting risk and enhancing model performance; (2) A global and local segmentation framework that breaks down the main task into two simpler sub-tasks, allowing optimized preprocessing and training for each; and (3) Pre- and post-processing pipelines customized to the challenges of each subtask aimed to enhance tumor visibility and refines tumor boundaries. We apply the proposed model on a challenging HCC-TACE-Seg dataset and show that SmoothSegNet outperformed various benchmarks in segmentation performance, particularly at smaller tumors (<10cm). Our ablation studies show that the three design components complementarily contribute to the model improved performance. Code for the proposed method are available at https://github.com/lingchm/medassist-liver-cancer.

Abstract: Substantial efforts have been devoted to alleviating the impact of the long-tailed class distribution in federated learning. In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon that certain weak classes consistently exist even for class-balanced learning. These weak classes, different from the minority classes in the previous works, are inherent to data and remain fairly consistent for various network structures, learning paradigms, and data partitioning methods. The inherent inter-class accuracy discrepancy can reach over 36.9% for federated learning on the FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, even when the class distribution is balanced both globally and locally. In this study, we empirically analyze the potential reason for this phenomenon. Furthermore, a partial knowledge distillation (PKD) method is proposed to improve the model's classification accuracy for weak classes. In this approach, knowledge transfer is initiated upon the occurrence of specific misclassifications within certain weak classes. Experimental results show that the accuracy of weak classes can be improved by 10.7%, reducing the inherent inter-class discrepancy effectively.

Abstract: In healthcare, the integration of multimodal data is pivotal for developing comprehensive diagnostic and predictive models. However, managing missing data remains a significant challenge in real-world applications. We introduce MARIA (Multimodal Attention Resilient to Incomplete datA), a novel transformer-based deep learning model designed to address these challenges through an intermediate fusion strategy. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on imputation, MARIA utilizes a masked self-attention mechanism, which processes only the available data without generating synthetic values. This approach enables it to effectively handle incomplete datasets, enhancing robustness and minimizing biases introduced by imputation methods. We evaluated MARIA against 10 state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models across 8 diagnostic and prognostic tasks. The results demonstrate that MARIA outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and resilience to varying levels of data incompleteness, underscoring its potential for critical healthcare applications.

Abstract: Disease progression models are widely used to inform the diagnosis and treatment of many progressive diseases. However, a significant limitation of existing models is that they do not account for health disparities that can bias the observed data. To address this, we develop an interpretable Bayesian disease progression model that captures three key health disparities: certain patient populations may (1) start receiving care only when their disease is more severe, (2) experience faster disease progression even while receiving care, or (3) receive follow-up care less frequently conditional on disease severity. We show theoretically and empirically that failing to account for any of these disparities can result in biased estimates of severity (e.g., underestimating severity for disadvantaged groups). On a dataset of heart failure patients, we show that our model can identify groups that face each type of health disparity, and that accounting for these disparities while inferring disease severity meaningfully shifts which patients are considered high-risk.

Abstract: Modern machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning based techniques, typically involve careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance. Despite the surge of intense interest in practical techniques like Bayesian optimization and random search based approaches to automating this laborious and compute intensive task, the fundamental learning theoretic complexity of tuning hyperparameters for deep neural networks is poorly understood. Inspired by this glaring gap, we initiate the formal study of hyperparameter tuning complexity in deep learning through a recently introduced data driven setting. We assume that we have a series of deep learning tasks, and we have to tune hyperparameters to do well on average over the distribution of tasks. A major difficulty is that the utility function as a function of the hyperparameter is very volatile and furthermore, it is given implicitly by an optimization problem over the model parameters. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new technique to characterize the discontinuities and oscillations of the utility function on any fixed problem instance as we vary the hyperparameter; our analysis relies on subtle concepts including tools from differential/algebraic geometry and constrained optimization. This can be used to show that the learning theoretic complexity of the corresponding family of utility functions is bounded. We instantiate our results and provide sample complexity bounds for concrete applications tuning a hyperparameter that interpolates neural activation functions and setting the kernel parameter in graph neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce BCAT, a PDE foundation model designed for autoregressive prediction of solutions to two dimensional fluid dynamics problems. Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 3.5x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.18% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks. With fine-tuning on a turbulence dataset, we show that the method adapts to new settings with more than 40% better accuracy over prior methods.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of automated decision-making based on neural networks will be crucial as Artificial Intelligence systems are deployed more widely in critical situations. This paper proposes a new approach for measuring confidence in the predictions of any neural network that relies on the predictions of a softmax layer. We identify that a high-accuracy trained network may have certain outputs for which there should be low confidence. In such cases, decisions should be deferred and it is more appropriate for the network to provide a \textit{not known} answer to a corresponding classification task. Our approach clusters the vectors in the softmax layer to measure distances between cluster centroids and network outputs. We show that a cluster with centroid calculated simply as the mean softmax output for all correct predictions can serve as a suitable proxy in the evaluation of confidence. Defining a distance threshold for a class as the smallest distance from an incorrect prediction to the given class centroid offers a simple approach to adding \textit{not known} answers to any network classification falling outside of the threshold. We evaluate the approach on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using a Convolutional Neural Network and a Vision Transformer, respectively. The results show that our approach is consistent across datasets and network models, and indicate that the proposed distance metric can offer an efficient way of determining when automated predictions are acceptable and when they should be deferred to human operators.

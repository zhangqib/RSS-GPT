<div> Keywords: language model, uncertainty, linguistic calibration, conformal guarantees, adaptive claim rewriting

Summary:<br>
Language model outputs can be unreliable, leading to research on adapting responses based on uncertainty. Common approaches include abstention, where models refrain from generating responses, and linguistic calibration, where models hedge statements with uncertainty quantifiers. A unified approach, Conformal Linguistic Calibration (CLC), interprets linguistic calibration as answer set prediction. By connecting abstention and linguistic calibration through linguistic pragmatics, CLC allows for controlling the imprecision in model responses. Results show that CLC produces calibrated outputs with conformal guarantees on factual accuracy. Additionally, CLC enables fine-tuning models for uncertainty-aware adaptive claim rewriting, striking a balance between factuality and specificity.<br> <div>

Abstract: Language model outputs are not always reliable, thus prompting research into how to adapt model responses based on uncertainty. Common approaches include: \emph{abstention}, where models refrain from generating responses when uncertain; and \emph{linguistic calibration}, where models hedge their statements using uncertainty quantifiers. However, abstention can withhold valuable information, while linguistically calibrated responses are often challenging to leverage in downstream tasks. We propose a unified view, Conformal Linguistic Calibration (CLC), which reinterprets linguistic calibration as \emph{answer set prediction}. First we present a framework connecting abstention and linguistic calibration through the lens of linguistic pragmatics. We then describe an implementation of CLC that allows for controlling the level of imprecision in model responses. Results demonstrate our method produces calibrated outputs with conformal guarantees on factual accuracy. Further, our approach enables fine-tuning models to perform uncertainty-aware adaptive claim rewriting, offering a controllable balance between factuality and specificity.

<div> Latent matrix factorization, binarizing factors, multi-scale compensation mechanism, Dual-SVID, integrated Residual Compensation <br />
Summary: <br />
LittleBit is a novel method for extreme compression of large language models (LLMs) targeting levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31 times memory reduction. It represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization and integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism to counteract information loss. Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) enables stable quantization-aware training initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation helps mitigate errors. LittleBit outperforms leading methods in sub-1-bit quantization and shows potential for a 5 times speedup compared to FP16 in kernel-level benchmarks, paving the way for deploying powerful LLMs in resource-constrained environments. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) often faces challenges from substantial memory and computational costs. Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for stable quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW. This establishes a superior size-performance trade-off, with kernel-level benchmarks indicating potential for a 5$\times$ speedup compared to FP16. LittleBit paves the way for deploying powerful LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Knowledge editing, Mobile devices, Quantized gradient estimation, Energy-efficient NPUs

Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) deployed on mobile devices can struggle with personalized or unseen queries, leading to incorrect responses. To address this issue, the MobiEdit framework has been developed to enable efficient LLM personalization on commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices. MobiEdit utilizes quantized forward-only gradient estimation instead of resource-heavy backpropagation, making it compatible with energy-efficient mobile neural processing units (NPUs). Two optimizations, an early stopping mechanism and prefix cache, further enhance gradient estimation efficiency. This approach allows for real-time editing of a 3B-parameter model on mobile devices with significantly reduced memory usage, energy consumption, and latency compared to previous methods. MobiEdit represents a significant advancement in enabling effective and efficient knowledge editing on mobile devices. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed on mobile devices to power killer applications such as intelligent assistants. LLMs pre-trained on general corpora often hallucinate when handling personalized or unseen queries, leading to incorrect or outdated responses. Knowledge editing addresses this by identifying and adjusting a small crucial portion of model weights, without compromising the general knowledge. However, prior knowledge editing methods are impractical to run on local devices due to the resource-heavy backpropagation (BP) needed for updates. We present MobiEdit, the first mobile knowledge editing framework that enables efficient LLM personalization on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices. MobiEdit replaces full-precision BP with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, thus compatible with the energy-efficient mobile neural processing units (NPUs). MobiEdit replaces full-precision backpropagation with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, making it compatible with energy-efficient mobile NPUs. To further improve gradient estimation efficiency, we introduce two optimizations: an early stoping mechanism that adaptively terminates editing upon success and a prefix cache that reuses computation across steps. Our approach enables real-time editing of a 3B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) on COTS mobile devices with 7.6$\times$ less memory, 14.7 $\times$ less energy and 3.6$\times$ less latency compared to previous knowledge editing methods.

Abstract: The job shop scheduling problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem relevant to manufacturing and timetabling. Traditional approaches use priority dispatching rules based on simple heuristics. Recent work has attempted to replace these with deep learning models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), that learn to assign priorities from data. However, training such models requires customizing numerous factors: graph representation, node features, action space, and reward functions. The lack of modular libraries for experimentation makes this research time-consuming. This work introduces JobShopLib, a modular library that allows customizing these factors and creating new components with its reinforcement learning environment. We trained several dispatchers through imitation learning to demonstrate the environment's utility. One model outperformed various graph-based dispatchers using only individual operation features, highlighting the importance of feature customization. Our GNN model achieved near state-of-the-art results on large-scale problems. These results suggest significant room for improvement in developing such models. JobShopLib provides the necessary tools for future experimentation.

Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, leading to complications like heart disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage. Accurate state-level predictions are vital for effective healthcare planning and targeted interventions, but in many cases, data for necessary analyses are incomplete. This study begins with a data engineering process to integrate diabetes-related datasets from 2011 to 2021 to create a comprehensive feature set. We then introduce an enhanced bagging ensemble regression model (EBMBag+) for time series forecasting to predict diabetes prevalence across U.S. cities. Several baseline models, including SVMReg, BDTree, LSBoost, NN, LSTM, and ERMBag, were evaluated for comparison with our EBMBag+ algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that EBMBag+ achieved the best performance, with an MAE of 0.41, RMSE of 0.53, MAPE of 4.01, and an R2 of 0.9.

Summary: 
The article presents a hybrid meta-learning framework for forecasting and anomaly detection in nonlinear dynamical systems. It integrates a physics-inspired simulator with random perturbations to capture complex system behavior. The framework combines CNN-LSTM architectures for feature extraction, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for anomaly scoring, Isolation Forests for outlier detection, and a Dual-Stage Attention Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) for forecasting.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid meta-learning framework for forecasting and anomaly detection in nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by nonstationary and stochastic behavior. The approach integrates a physics-inspired simulator that captures nonlinear growth-relaxation dynamics with random perturbations, representative of many complex physical, industrial, and cyber-physical systems. We use CNN-LSTM architectures for spatio-temporal feature extraction, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly scoring, and Isolation Forests for residual-based outlier detection in addition to a Dual-Stage Attention Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) for one-step forecasting on top of the generated simulation data. To create composite anomaly forecasts, these models are combined using a meta-learner that combines forecasting outputs, reconstruction errors, and residual scores. The hybrid ensemble performs better than standalone models in anomaly localization, generalization, and robustness to nonlinear deviations, according to simulation-based experiments. The framework provides a broad, data-driven approach to early defect identification and predictive monitoring in nonlinear systems, which may be applied to a variety of scenarios where complete physical models might not be accessible.

<div> Keywords: Concept-based approaches, CLIP, hypothesis testing, concept decomposition, spurious cues

Summary: 
Concept-based approaches are important for interpreting embeddings from deep neural networks like CLIP, but current methods lack statistical rigor. To address this, a new hypothesis testing framework is introduced to quantify rotation-sensitive structures in the CLIP embedding space. A post-hoc concept decomposition method is proposed to identify robust and reproducible patterns, outperforming existing techniques in reconstruction error. Empirical results show that the algorithm balances reconstruction accuracy and concept interpretability, reducing spurious cues in data. When applied to a spurious correlation dataset, the method improves worst-group accuracy by 22.6% after eliminating spurious background concepts. The work provides a more reliable and effective approach to understanding and interpreting concepts within deep neural network models, offering theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept-based approaches, which aim to identify human-understandable concepts within a model's internal representations, are a promising method for interpreting embeddings from deep neural network models, such as CLIP. While these approaches help explain model behavior, current methods lack statistical rigor, making it challenging to validate identified concepts and compare different techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a hypothesis testing framework that quantifies rotation-sensitive structures within the CLIP embedding space. Once such structures are identified, we propose a post-hoc concept decomposition method. Unlike existing approaches, it offers theoretical guarantees that discovered concepts represent robust, reproducible patterns (rather than method-specific artifacts) and outperforms other techniques in terms of reconstruction error. Empirically, we demonstrate that our concept-based decomposition algorithm effectively balances reconstruction accuracy with concept interpretability and helps mitigate spurious cues in data. Applied to a popular spurious correlation dataset, our method yields a 22.6% increase in worst-group accuracy after removing spurious background concepts.

Abstract: This paper presents an evolvable conditional diffusion method such that black-box, non-differentiable multi-physics models, as are common in domains like computational fluid dynamics and electromagnetics, can be effectively used for guiding the generative process to facilitate autonomous scientific discovery. We formulate the guidance as an optimization problem where one optimizes for a desired fitness function through updates to the descriptive statistic for the denoising distribution, and derive an evolution-guided approach from first principles through the lens of probabilistic evolution. Interestingly, the final derived update algorithm is analogous to the update as per common gradient-based guided diffusion models, but without ever having to compute any derivatives. We validate our proposed evolvable diffusion algorithm in two AI for Science scenarios: the automated design of fluidic topology and meta-surface. Results demonstrate that this method effectively generates designs that better satisfy specific optimization objectives without reliance on differentiable proxies, providing an effective means of guidance-based diffusion that can capitalize on the wealth of black-box, non-differentiable multi-physics numerical models common across Science.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces T-REX, a simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. It models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' behaviors, such as rerouting and speed adaptation, to simulate congestion propagation under incidents. The study proposes a suite of metrics to assess the robustness of RL-TSC methods. Experiments across synthetic and real-world networks show that independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods converge quickly but struggle under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods offer stable performance in large, irregular networks but with slower convergence and higher complexity. The findings emphasize the importance of robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX provides an open, standardized platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.<br /> 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control (RL-TSC) has emerged as a promising approach for improving urban mobility. However, its robustness under real-world disruptions such as traffic incidents remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce T-REX, an open-source, SUMO-based simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. T-REX models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' probabilistic rerouting, speed adaptation, and contextual lane-changing, enabling the simulation of congestion propagation under incidents. To assess robustness, we propose a suite of metrics that extend beyond conventional traffic efficiency measures. Through extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world networks, we showcase T-REX for the evaluation of several state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods under multiple real-world deployment paradigms. Our findings show that while independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods offer fast convergence and generalization in stable traffic conditions and homogeneous networks, their performance degrades sharply under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods tend to offer more stable and adaptable performance in large-scale, irregular networks, benefiting from their structured decision-making architecture. However, this comes with the trade-off of slower convergence and higher training complexity. These findings highlight the need for robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX contributes to this effort by providing an open, standardized and reproducible platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.

Summary: 
Retraining for machine learning systems is crucial for maintaining reliability in the face of changing data, but it can be energy-intensive. This study compares common retraining techniques in terms of energy efficiency and accuracy. The results show that retraining with only the most recent data, as opposed to all available data, can reduce energy consumption by up to 25%, offering a sustainable alternative. Additionally, retraining a model only when necessary, rather than on a fixed schedule, can further decrease energy consumption by up to 40% with the use of a reliable data change detector. These findings provide valuable insights for ML practitioners, suggesting more energy-efficient retraining techniques for designing sustainable ML software systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The reliability of machine learning (ML) software systems is heavily influenced by changes in data over time. For that reason, ML systems require regular maintenance, typically based on model retraining. However, retraining requires significant computational demand, which makes it energy-intensive and raises concerns about its environmental impact. To understand which retraining techniques should be considered when designing sustainable ML applications, in this work, we study the energy consumption of common retraining techniques. Since the accuracy of ML systems is also essential, we compare retraining techniques in terms of both energy efficiency and accuracy. We showcase that retraining with only the most recent data, compared to all available data, reduces energy consumption by up to 25\%, being a sustainable alternative to the status quo. Furthermore, our findings show that retraining a model only when there is evidence that updates are necessary, rather than on a fixed schedule, can reduce energy consumption by up to 40\%, provided a reliable data change detector is in place. Our findings pave the way for better recommendations for ML practitioners, guiding them toward more energy-efficient retraining techniques when designing sustainable ML software systems.

SatHealth dataset addresses this gap by combining multimodal spatiotemporal data, including environmental data, satellite images, disease prevalences, and social determinants of health indicators. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating living environmental information in AI models for regional public health modeling and personal disease risk prediction. A web-based application provides access to the dataset and regional environmental embedding for easy utilization. SatHealth is currently available for Ohio, with plans to expand coverage across the US. This work sets the foundation for future research in environmental health informatics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Living environments play a vital role in the prevalence and progression of diseases, and understanding their impact on patient's health status becomes increasingly crucial for developing AI models. However, due to the lack of long-term and fine-grained spatial and temporal data in public and population health studies, most existing studies fail to incorporate environmental data, limiting the models' performance and real-world application. To address this shortage, we developed SatHealth, a novel dataset combining multimodal spatiotemporal data, including environmental data, satellite images, all-disease prevalences estimated from medical claims, and social determinants of health (SDoH) indicators. We conducted experiments under two use cases with SatHealth: regional public health modeling and personal disease risk prediction. Experimental results show that living environmental information can significantly improve AI models' performance and temporal-spatial generalizability on various tasks. Finally, we deploy a web-based application to provide an exploration tool for SatHealth and one-click access to both our data and regional environmental embedding to facilitate plug-and-play utilization. SatHealth is now published with data in Ohio, and we will keep updating SatHealth to cover the other parts of the US. With the web application and published code pipeline, our work provides valuable angles and resources to include environmental data in healthcare research and establishes a foundational framework for future research in environmental health informatics.

Summary:
In the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), regularization techniques have become popular for improving exploration, robustness, and stability in algorithms such as SAC and TRPO. Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) addresses the regularized policy optimization problem theoretically but practical implementation is hindered by the computational complexity of past Q-functions. A new algorithm called StaQ is proposed, based on PMD principles, that only retains the last $M$ Q-functions in memory for a convergent solution. This approach eliminates errors in policy updates seen in previous deep RL PMD implementations and shows improved performance stability compared to existing algorithms. StaQ offers strong theoretical guarantees and proves to be competitive with deep RL baselines, opening avenues for more stable deep RL algorithms and serving as a platform for further Policy Mirror Descent experimentation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), regularization has emerged as a popular tool both in theory and practice, typically based either on an entropy bonus or a Kullback-Leibler divergence that constrains successive policies. In practice, these approaches have been shown to improve exploration, robustness and stability, giving rise to popular Deep RL algorithms such as SAC and TRPO. Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a theoretical framework that solves this general regularized policy optimization problem, however the closed-form solution involves the sum of all past Q-functions, which is intractable in practice. We propose and analyze PMD-like algorithms that only keep the last $M$ Q-functions in memory, and show that for finite and large enough $M$, a convergent algorithm can be derived, introducing no error in the policy update, unlike prior deep RL PMD implementations. StaQ, the resulting algorithm, enjoys strong theoretical guarantees and is competitive with deep RL baselines, while exhibiting less performance oscillation, paving the way for fully stable deep RL algorithms and providing a testbed for experimentation with Policy Mirror Descent.

Summary:
The study introduces Algorithm Distillation (AD) for In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) using a causal transformer model. However, practical limitations hindered its application in complex environments with long time horizons. To address this, the researchers propose using Selective Structured State Space Sequence (S6) models, known for their linear scalability in sequence length and state-of-the-art performance in sequence modeling. Through experiments in Meta Reinforcement Learning environments, a model called Mamba, built with S6 layers, outperformed the transformer model for AD. Scaling AD to longer contexts proved beneficial, enhancing ICRL performance and enabling competitiveness with a leading online meta RL baseline. This signifies the potential of S6 models in improving AD for ICRL tasks in challenging settings. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithm Distillation (AD) was recently proposed as a new approach to perform In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) by modeling across-episodic training histories autoregressively with a causal transformer model. However, due to practical limitations induced by the attention mechanism, experiments were bottlenecked by the transformer's quadratic complexity and limited to simple discrete environments with short time horizons. In this work, we propose leveraging the recently proposed Selective Structured State Space Sequence (S6) models, which achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-range sequence modeling while scaling linearly in sequence length. Through four complex and continuous Meta Reinforcement Learning environments, we demonstrate the overall superiority of Mamba, a model built with S6 layers, over a transformer model for AD. Additionally, we show that scaling AD to very long contexts can improve ICRL performance and make it competitive even with a SOTA online meta RL baseline.

<div> Keywords: rule-based systems, feature contributions, interpretability, clinical datasets, diagnostic accuracy

Summary:
In domains like healthcare, interpretability and trust are essential, leading to the preference for rule-based systems over black-box models for decision support. However, as rule-based models become more complex, understanding feature importance and comparing contributions across different rule sets presents challenges. This study introduces a comprehensive framework for estimating feature contributions in rule-based systems. It includes a graph-based feature visualization strategy, a novel feature importance metric independent of rule-based predictors, and a distance metric for comparing rule sets based on feature contributions. Through experiments on clinical datasets and various rule-based methods, such as decision trees and neural networks, the framework uncovers new insights into the combined predictive value of clinical features at both dataset and class-specific levels. This method can help identify new risk factors, signature genes, potential biomarkers, and enhance diagnostic accuracy. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks shows competitive performance and superior robustness. The implementation of the method is available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: In domains where transparency and trustworthiness are crucial, such as healthcare, rule-based systems are widely used and often preferred over black-box models for decision support systems due to their inherent interpretability. However, as rule-based models grow complex, discerning crucial features, understanding their interactions, and comparing feature contributions across different rule sets becomes challenging. To address this, we propose a comprehensive framework for estimating feature contributions in rule-based systems, introducing a graph-based feature visualisation strategy, a novel feature importance metric agnostic to rule-based predictors, and a distance metric for comparing rule sets based on feature contributions. By experimenting on two clinical datasets and four rule-based methods (decision trees, logic learning machines, association rules, and neural networks with rule extraction), we showcase our method's capability to uncover novel insights on the combined predictive value of clinical features, both at the dataset and class-specific levels. These insights can aid in identifying new risk factors, signature genes, and potential biomarkers, and determining the subset of patient information that should be prioritised to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Comparative analysis of the proposed feature importance score with state-of-the-art methods on 15 public benchmarks demonstrates competitive performance and superior robustness. The method implementation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/ChristelSirocchi/rule-graph.

<div> Graph-informed transformer operator, complex partial differential equations, irregular geometries, non-uniform meshes, hybrid graph transformer<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
A novel graph-informed transformer operator (GITO) architecture is proposed for learning complex partial differential equation systems on irregular geometries and non-uniform meshes. The GITO consists of two modules: a hybrid graph transformer (HGT) and a transformer neural operator (TNO). The HGT combines a graph neural network (GNN) and a transformer to capture local spatial relationships and long-range dependencies. A self-attention fusion layer integrates the outputs of the GNN and transformer for more expressive feature learning on graph-structured data. The TNO module utilizes cross-attention and self-attention layers for mapping input functions to predictions at arbitrary query locations, ensuring discretization invariance and enabling zero-shot super-resolution across any mesh. Empirical results show that GITO outperforms existing transformer-based neural operators, promising efficient, mesh-agnostic surrogate solvers for engineering applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We present a novel graph-informed transformer operator (GITO) architecture for learning complex partial differential equation systems defined on irregular geometries and non-uniform meshes. GITO consists of two main modules: a hybrid graph transformer (HGT) and a transformer neural operator (TNO). HGT leverages a graph neural network (GNN) to encode local spatial relationships and a transformer to capture long-range dependencies. A self-attention fusion layer integrates the outputs of the GNN and transformer to enable more expressive feature learning on graph-structured data. TNO module employs linear-complexity cross-attention and self-attention layers to map encoded input functions to predictions at arbitrary query locations, ensuring discretization invariance and enabling zero-shot super-resolution across any mesh. Empirical results on benchmark PDE tasks demonstrate that GITO outperforms existing transformer-based neural operators, paving the way for efficient, mesh-agnostic surrogate solvers in engineering applications.

<div> Keywords: Few-shot learning, industrial time-series data, screw-fastening process monitoring, label-aware episodic sampler, metric-based Prototypical Network

Summary:
In this study, the application of few-shot learning (FSL) to industrial time-series data for screw-fastening process monitoring was explored. A new label-aware episodic sampler was introduced to handle multi-label sequences efficiently. Two FSL paradigms, Prototypical Network and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), were tested with different network backbones. The results showed that the InceptionTime + Prototypical Network combination achieved high accuracy in both multi-class and multi-label regimes, outperforming a larger transformer model. Metric learning consistently outperformed MAML across all backbones, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight CNN architectures in scenarios with limited data. The findings challenge the belief that larger models are always superior and highlight the importance of efficient training methods for industrial applications. A code, data splits, and pre-trained weights are provided to facilitate reproducible research and promote the adoption of FSL in manufacturing inspection.

<br /><br />Summary: 
This study explores few-shot learning in industrial time-series data for screw-fastening process monitoring, introducing a label-aware sampler and testing different FSL approaches and network backbones. Results show the effectiveness of metric learning over traditional MAML, with lightweight CNN architectures outperforming larger models in scenarios with limited data. The findings challenge the notion that bigger models are always better and emphasize the importance of efficient training methods in industrial applications. The code, data splits, and pre-trained weights are made available for reproducible research and to encourage the adoption of FSL in manufacturing inspection. <div>
arXiv:2506.13909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) has shown promise in vision but remains largely unexplored for \emph{industrial} time-series data, where annotating every new defect is prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic FSL study on screw-fastening process monitoring, using a 2\,300-sample multivariate torque dataset that covers 16 uni- and multi-factorial defect types. Beyond benchmarking, we introduce a \textbf{label-aware episodic sampler} that collapses multi-label sequences into multiple single-label tasks, keeping the output dimensionality fixed while preserving combinatorial label information.
  Two FSL paradigms are investigated: the metric-based \emph{Prototypical Network} and the gradient-based \emph{Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning} (MAML), each paired with three backbones: 1D CNN, InceptionTime and the 341 M-parameter transformer \emph{Moment}. On 10-shot, 3-way evaluation, the InceptionTime + Prototypical Network combination achieves a \textbf{0.944 weighted F1} in the multi-class regime and \textbf{0.935} in the multi-label regime, outperforming finetuned Moment by up to 5.3\% while requiring two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training time. Across all backbones, metric learning consistently surpasses MAML, and our label-aware sampling yields an additional 1.7\% F1 over traditional class-based sampling.
  These findings challenge the assumption that large foundation models are always superior: when data are scarce, lightweight CNN architectures augmented with simple metric learning not only converge faster but also generalize better. We release code, data splits and pre-trained weights to foster reproducible research and to catalyze the adoption of FSL in high-value manufacturing inspection.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Hierarchical Ego Graph Neural Networks (HEGNNs), a novel extension of GNNs that incorporates hierarchical node individualization inspired by the Individualization-Refinement concept for graph isomorphism testing. HEGNNs generalize subgraph-GNNs and create a hierarchy of models that can distinguish graphs up to isomorphism. The study provides a logical characterization of HEGNN node classifiers using graded hybrid logic, linking the separating power of HEGNNs to higher-order GNNs, local homomorphism count feature-enriched GNNs, and color refinement algorithms based on Individualization-Refinement. Experimental results demonstrate the practicality of HEGNNs and their advantages over traditional GNN architectures, with or without local homomorphism count features. <div>

Abstract: We propose and study Hierarchical Ego Graph Neural Networks (HEGNNs), an expressive extension of graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical node individualization, inspired by the Individualization-Refinement paradigm for graph isomorphism testing. HEGNNs generalize subgraph-GNNs and form a hierarchy of increasingly expressive models that, in the limit, can distinguish graphs up to isomorphism. We provide a logical characterization of HEGNN node classifiers, with and without subgraph restrictions, using graded hybrid logic. This characterization enables us to relate the separating power of HEGNNs to that of higher-order GNNs, GNNs enriched with local homomorphism count features, and color refinement algorithms based on Individualization-Refinement. Our experimental results confirm the practical feasibility of HEGNNs and show benefits in comparison with traditional GNN architectures, both with and without local homomorphism count features.

Summary:
The article introduces the Branched Stein Variational Gradient Descent (BSVGD) method, a novel particle-based approach aimed at handling multimodal distributions. BSVGD extends the traditional Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm by integrating a random branching mechanism to promote exploration of the state space. The algorithm is supported by a theoretical convergence guarantee in distribution, setting it apart from traditional methods like SVGD. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of BSVGD, showing improved performance in terms of Wasserstein distance and computational times compared to SVGD. BSVGD offers a promising alternative for tackling complex multimodal distributions in variational inference tasks.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, capability gain, self-distillation, natural language guidance, online training algorithms 

Summary: 
Reinforcement learning models trained with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn to solve new problems by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and through capability gain, where they can solve new problems they previously could not. The learning process is primarily driven by self-distillation across model scales. By incorporating natural language guidance, models can improve pass@$k$ rates while deriving solutions from scratch. The article introduces $\text{Guide}$, a new class of online training algorithms that adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on difficult problems. Variants of $\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO show improved generalization on math benchmarks for large parameter models. Ablations and theoretical analyses are included to understand $\text{Guide}$'s components and learning efficiency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the process through which reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning on verifiable rewards (RLVR) can learn to solve new problems. We find that RLVR drives performance through two main means: (1) by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via "capability gain" in which models learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high $k$. We find that while capability gain exists across model scales, learning to solve new problems is primarily driven through self-distillation. We demonstrate these findings across model scales ranging from 0.5B to 72B on >500,000 reasoning problems with prompts and verifiable final answers across math, science, and code domains. We further show that we can significantly improve pass@$k$ rates by leveraging natural language guidance for the model to consider within context while still requiring the model to derive a solution chain from scratch. Based of these insights, we derive $\text{Guide}$ - a new class of online training algorithms. $\text{Guide}$ adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on problems for which all rollouts were initially incorrect and adjusts the importance sampling ratio for the "off-policy" trajectories in order to optimize the policy for contexts in which the hints are no longer present. We describe variants of $\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO and empirically show that Guide-GRPO on 7B and 32B parameter models improves generalization over its vanilla counterpart with up to 4$\%$ macro-average improvement across math benchmarks. We include careful ablations to analyze $\text{Guide}$'s components and theoretically analyze Guide's learning efficiency.

<div> distributed machine learning, precision agriculture, split learning, reinforcement learning, insect classification

Summary:
ReinDSplit introduces a new framework for precision agriculture utilizing distributed machine learning. It addresses the limitations of conventional split learning by employing reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize DNN split points for individual devices. This allows for more efficient resource utilization and improved model performance. The framework utilizes a Q-learning agent to balance workloads and latency thresholds across devices, ensuring that even highly constrained devices contribute meaningfully to model training. Evaluated on insect classification datasets, ReinDSplit achieves high accuracy with MobileNetV2. This innovative approach not only benefits agriculture but also advances the field of split learning by leveraging reinforcement learning for enhanced resource efficiency, privacy preservation, and scalability in heterogeneous environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To empower precision agriculture through distributed machine learning (DML), split learning (SL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, partitioning deep neural networks (DNNs) between edge devices and servers to reduce computational burdens and preserve data privacy. However, conventional SL frameworks' one-split-fits-all strategy is a critical limitation in agricultural ecosystems where edge insect monitoring devices exhibit vast heterogeneity in computational power, energy constraints, and connectivity. This leads to straggler bottlenecks, inefficient resource utilization, and compromised model performance. Bridging this gap, we introduce ReinDSplit, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework that dynamically tailors DNN split points for each device, optimizing efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a Q-learning agent acts as an adaptive orchestrator, balancing workloads and latency thresholds across devices to mitigate computational starvation or overload. By framing split layer selection as a finite-state Markov decision process, ReinDSplit convergence ensures that highly constrained devices contribute meaningfully to model training over time. Evaluated on three insect classification datasets using ResNet18, GoogleNet, and MobileNetV2, ReinDSplit achieves 94.31% accuracy with MobileNetV2. Beyond agriculture, ReinDSplit pioneers a paradigm shift in SL by harmonizing RL for resource efficiency, privacy, and scalability in heterogeneous environments.

- A post-hoc explainability framework is introduced to analyze how intrinsic motivation influences learned embeddings in EDTs.

arXiv:2506.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic Decision Transformers (EDTs) have proved to be particularly successful in offline reinforcement learning, offering a flexible framework that unifies sequence modeling with decision-making under uncertainty. Recent research has shown that incorporating intrinsic motivation mechanisms into EDTs improves performance across exploration tasks, yet the representational mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a systematic post-hoc explainability framework to analyze how intrinsic motivation shapes learned embeddings in EDTs. Through statistical analysis of embedding properties (including covariance structure, vector magnitudes, and orthogonality), we reveal that different intrinsic motivation variants create fundamentally different representational structures. Our analysis demonstrates environment-specific correlation patterns between embedding metrics and performance that explain why intrinsic motivation improves policy learning. These findings show that intrinsic motivation operates beyond simple exploration bonuses, acting as a representational prior that shapes embedding geometry in biologically plausible ways, creating environment-specific organizational structures that facilitate better decision-making.

arXiv:2506.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a significant threat to the privacy of machine learning models and are widely used as tools for privacy assessment, auditing, and machine unlearning. While prior MIA research has primarily focused on performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and TPR@low FPR - either by developing new methods to enhance these metrics or using them to evaluate privacy solutions - we found that it overlooks the disparities among different attacks. These disparities, both between distinct attack methods and between multiple instantiations of the same method, have crucial implications for the reliability and completeness of MIAs as privacy evaluation tools. In this paper, we systematically investigate these disparities through a novel framework based on coverage and stability analysis. Extensive experiments reveal significant disparities in MIAs, their potential causes, and their broader implications for privacy evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose an ensemble framework with three distinct strategies to harness the strengths of state-of-the-art MIAs while accounting for their disparities. This framework not only enables the construction of more powerful attacks but also provides a more robust and comprehensive methodology for privacy evaluation.

<div> heterogeneous objectives, Local Gradient Descent, logistic regression, communication rounds, convergence rate<br />
Summary:<br />
The study examines Local Gradient Descent for logistic regression with separable, heterogeneous data, allowing any stepsize $\eta > 0$. It demonstrates convergence at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\eta K R)$ after an initial unstable phase of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\eta K M)$ rounds. Unlike previous analyses that required $\eta \leq 1/K$ for monotonic decrease, this work shows improvement with any $\eta > 0. The research aligns with prior work on single-machine analysis, attributing instability to large stepsizes and heterogeneous objectives leading to significant local updates. This advancement contrasts the existing $\mathcal{O}(1/R)$ convergence rate for general smooth, convex objectives. <div>
arXiv:2506.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing analysis of Local (Stochastic) Gradient Descent for heterogeneous objectives requires stepsizes $\eta \leq 1/K$ where $K$ is the communication interval, which ensures monotonic decrease of the objective. In contrast, we analyze Local Gradient Descent for logistic regression with separable, heterogeneous data using any stepsize $\eta > 0$. With $R$ communication rounds and $M$ clients, we show convergence at a rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\eta K R)$ after an initial unstable phase lasting for $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\eta K M)$ rounds. This improves upon the existing $\mathcal{O}(1/R)$ rate for general smooth, convex objectives. Our analysis parallels the single machine analysis of~\cite{wu2024large} in which instability is caused by extremely large stepsizes, but in our setting another source of instability is large local updates with heterogeneous objectives.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces QCL-MixNet, a novel framework for handling imbalanced tabular data in expert systems. It addresses challenges such as overfitting, label noise, and poor generalization in low-density regions by incorporating a Quantum Entanglement-inspired layer, a sample-aware mixup strategy, and a hybrid loss function. The framework outperforms 20 state-of-the-art baselines in macro-F1 and recall on 18 real-world imbalanced datasets. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each architectural component. The results establish QCL-MixNet as a new benchmark for handling imbalance in expert systems. Theoretical analyses support its expressiveness, generalization, and optimization robustness. <div>
arXiv:2506.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expert systems often operate in domains characterized by class-imbalanced tabular data, where detecting rare but critical instances is essential for safety and reliability. While conventional approaches, such as cost-sensitive learning, oversampling, and graph neural networks, provide partial solutions, they suffer from drawbacks like overfitting, label noise, and poor generalization in low-density regions. To address these challenges, we propose QCL-MixNet, a novel Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning framework augmented with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) guided dynamic mixup for robust classification under imbalance. QCL-MixNet integrates three core innovations: (i) a Quantum Entanglement-inspired layer that models complex feature interactions through sinusoidal transformations and gated attention, (ii) a sample-aware mixup strategy that adaptively interpolates feature representations of semantically similar instances to enhance minority class representation, and (iii) a hybrid loss function that unifies focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning, triplet margin loss, and variance regularization to improve both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on 18 real-world imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class) demonstrate that QCL-MixNet consistently outperforms 20 state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and GNN-based baselines in macro-F1 and recall, often by substantial margins. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of each architectural component. Our results establish QCL-MixNet as a new benchmark for tabular imbalance handling in expert systems. Theoretical analyses reinforce its expressiveness, generalization, and optimization robustness.

Summary:  
- Large language models (LLMs) are used in data science workflows but struggle to leverage domain knowledge effectively.  
- AssistedDS benchmark evaluates LLMs in tabular prediction tasks with synthetic and real-world datasets.  
- LLMs tend to blindly adopt provided information, leading to decreased predictive performance in the presence of adversarial content.  
- Helpful guidance is inadequate in mitigating the negative impact of adversarial information on LLMs.  
- LLMs show errors in handling time-series data, consistent feature engineering, and interpreting categorical variables in Kaggle datasets.  
- Current models lack the ability to critically evaluate and utilize expert knowledge, emphasizing the need to develop more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the automation of data science workflows. Yet it remains unclear whether they can critically leverage external domain knowledge as human data scientists do in practice. To answer this question, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These documents provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge, evaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance. Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an uncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their predictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful guidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of adversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in handling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across different folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly. These findings highlight a substantial gap in current models' ability to critically evaluate and leverage expert knowledge, underscoring an essential research direction for developing more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems.

Arctic Long Sequence Training (ALST) addresses the challenge of training long sequences in AI models by providing optimizations for single GPU and multi-GPU memory utilization. This allows for out-of-the-box training of multi-million sequence lengths for a variety of models, including Meta's Llama 8B model. ALST supports sequence lengths of 500K on a single H100 GPU, 3.7M on a single 8xH100 GPU node, and over 15M on a 4 node cluster. This represents a significant increase compared to the 32K baseline previously achieved. ALST is fully compatible with Hugging Face models and is open-sourced through Deepspeed and Arctic Training platforms. By leveraging attention-agnostic optimizations, ALST enables more efficient and accessible long sequence training for applications such as RAG, document summarization, and multi-modality.

Abstract: Long sequences are critical for applications like RAG, long document summarization, multi-modality, etc., and modern LLMs, like Llama 4 Scout, support max sequence length of up to 10 million tokens. However, outside of enterprise labs, long sequence training is challenging for the AI community with limited system support in the open-source space.
  Out-of-box, even on a modern NVIDIA H100 80GB GPU cluster, training Llama 8B model with sequence over 32K runs out of memory on a basic Hugging Face (HF) model due to two reasons: i) LLM training workloads are not optimized to fully leverage a single GPU memory, ii) existing solutions for leveraging multiple GPU memory are not easily available to HF models, making long sequence training inaccessible.
  We address this with Arctic Long Sequence Training (ALST). It offers a combination of attention-agnostic single GPU and multi-GPU memory optimizations, that enables it to support out-of-box training of multi-million sequence length for a wide variety of HF models.
  ALST supports training Meta's Llama 8B model with 500K sequence length on a single H100 GPU, 3.7M on a single 8xH100 GPU node, and over 15M on a 4 node cluster, an increase of over 400x compared to the 32K baseline for the latter. ALST is fully compatible with HF models and open-sourced via Deepspeed https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/ulysses-alst-sequence-pallellism/ and Arctic Training https://github.com/snowflakedb/ArcticTraining/blob/main/projects/sequence-parallelism/README.md.

Summary: <br />
This study addresses the challenge of achieving feature recovery using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for interpreting Large Language Models. A new statistical framework is proposed, defining feature identifiability and modeling polysemantic features as mixtures of underlying concepts. A novel SAE training algorithm based on bias adaptation is introduced, with theoretical proof of correct monosemantic feature recovery. An empirical variant, Group Bias Adaptation (GBA), outperforms benchmark methods when applied to LLMs with up to 1.5 billion parameters.

Abstract: We study the challenge of achieving theoretically grounded feature recovery using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for the interpretation of Large Language Models. Existing SAE training algorithms often lack rigorous mathematical guarantees and suffer from practical limitations such as hyperparameter sensitivity and instability. To address these issues, we first propose a novel statistical framework for the feature recovery problem, which includes a new notion of feature identifiability by modeling polysemantic features as sparse mixtures of underlying monosemantic concepts. Building on this framework, we introduce a new SAE training algorithm based on ``bias adaptation'', a technique that adaptively adjusts neural network bias parameters to ensure appropriate activation sparsity. We theoretically \highlight{prove that this algorithm correctly recovers all monosemantic features} when input data is sampled from our proposed statistical model. Furthermore, we develop an improved empirical variant, Group Bias Adaptation (GBA), and \highlight{demonstrate its superior performance against benchmark methods when applied to LLMs with up to 1.5 billion parameters}. This work represents a foundational step in demystifying SAE training by providing the first SAE algorithm with theoretical recovery guarantees, thereby advancing the development of more transparent and trustworthy AI systems through enhanced mechanistic interpretability.

<div> Machine unlearning, large language models, LLM unlearning, data privacy, copyright protection

Summary: 
Machine unlearning (MU) in large language models (LLMs) aims to remove specific undesirable data while maintaining performance. However, a new vulnerability post-unlearning is identified: unlearning trace detection. This leaves detectable "fingerprints" in LLMs, visible in model behavior and internal representations. Traces can be identified in output responses, even with forget-irrelevant inputs, through a simple supervised classifier. Analysis shows these traces are present in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer. Forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in trace detection across all model sizes. Large LLMs still have high detectability even with forget-irrelevant inputs, posing a risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information if a model is identified as unlearned. This study sheds light on the measurable signatures left by unlearning, posing a new risk in the field of machine unlearning in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models (LLMs), commonly referred to as LLM unlearning, seeks to remove specific undesirable data or knowledge from a trained model, while maintaining its performance on standard tasks. While unlearning plays a vital role in protecting data privacy, enforcing copyright, and mitigating sociotechnical harms in LLMs, we identify a new vulnerability post-unlearning: unlearning trace detection. We discover that unlearning leaves behind persistent ''fingerprints'' in LLMs, detectable traces in both model behavior and internal representations. These traces can be identified from output responses, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant inputs. Specifically, a simple supervised classifier can reliably determine whether a model has undergone unlearning based solely on its textual outputs. Further analysis shows that these traces are embedded in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer, forming low-dimensional, learnable manifolds in activation space. Through extensive experiments, we show that forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in detecting unlearning traces across all model sizes. Even with forget-irrelevant inputs, large LLMs maintain high detectability, demonstrating the broad applicability of unlearning trace detection. These findings reveal that unlearning leaves measurable signatures, introducing a new risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information when a model is identified as unlearned given an input query.

<div> Graph generation, diffusion models, flow-based models, Markov random fields, optimal transport displacement

Summary:
Graph generation is crucial in various fields like drug discovery. Current methods like diffusion and flow-based models construct a probability path linearly, assuming data lie in Euclidean space. This approach overlooks the non-Euclidean structure and interconnected patterns of graphs, potentially impacting sampling convergence. To address this limitation, a novel framework called BWFlow is introduced. BWFlow models the joint evolution of nodes and edges using Markov random fields and leverages optimal transport displacement to design a probability path for graph generation. The framework respects the underlying geometry of graphs, providing smooth velocities in the path. Experimental evaluations confirm BWFlow's effectiveness in graph generation, demonstrating competitive performance, stable training, and guaranteed sampling convergence.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph generation has emerged as a critical task in fields ranging from molecule design to drug discovery. Contemporary approaches, notably diffusion and flow-based models, have achieved solid graph generative performance through constructing a probability path that interpolates between a reference distribution and the data distribution. However, these methods typically model the evolution of individual nodes and edges independently and use linear interpolations to build the path assuming that the data lie in Euclidean space. We show that this is suboptimal given the intrinsic non-Euclidean structure and interconnected patterns of graphs, and it poses risks to the sampling convergence. To build a better probability path, we model the joint evolution of the nodes and edges by representing graphs as connected systems parameterized by Markov random fields (MRF). We then leverage the optimal transport displacement between MRF objects to design the probability path for graph generation. Based on this, we introduce BWFlow, a flow-matching framework for graph generation that respects the underlying geometry of graphs and provides smooth velocities in the probability path. The novel framework can be adapted to both continuous and discrete flow-matching algorithms. Experimental evaluations in plain graph generation and 2D/3D molecule generation validate the effectiveness of BWFlow in graph generation with competitive performance, stable training, and guaranteed sampling convergence.

Summary: <br />
The study introduces a novel Inverse Elasticity Physics-Informed Neural Network (IE-PINN) to accurately estimate spatially varying elasticity parameters such as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio from noisy displacement measurements. The network consists of three separate architectures for modeling displacement fields, strain fields, and elasticity distributions, enhancing stability and accuracy in the presence of noise. A two-phase estimation approach is utilized to recover relative elasticity distributions in the first phase and calibrate the absolute Young's modulus in the second phase. Methodological innovations including positional encoding and sine activation functions improve model performance. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate IE-PINN's ability to provide accurate absolute-scale elasticity estimations even in the presence of severe noise, highlighting its potential for applications in clinical imaging diagnostics and mechanical characterization. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating spatially heterogeneous elasticity parameters, particularly Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, from noisy displacement measurements remains significantly challenging in inverse elasticity problems. Existing inverse estimation techniques are often limited by instability, pronounced sensitivity to measurement noise, and difficulty in recovering absolute-scale Young's modulus. This work presents a novel Inverse Elasticity Physics-Informed Neural Network (IE-PINN) specifically designed to robustly reconstruct heterogeneous distributions of elasticity parameters from noisy displacement data based on linear elasticity physics. IE-PINN integrates three distinct neural network architectures dedicated to separately modeling displacement fields, strain fields, and elasticity distributions, thereby significantly enhancing stability and accuracy against measurement noise. Additionally, a two-phase estimation strategy is introduced: the first phase recovers relative spatial distributions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, and the second phase calibrates the absolute scale of Young's modulus using imposed loading boundary conditions. Additional methodological innovations, including positional encoding, sine activation functions, and a sequential pretraining protocol, further enhance the model's performance and robustness. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that IE-PINN effectively overcomes critical limitations encountered by existing methods, delivering accurate absolute-scale elasticity estimations even under severe noise conditions. This advancement holds substantial potential for clinical imaging diagnostics and mechanical characterization, where measurements typically encounter substantial noise.

<div> Sparse Mixture of Experts, Scalable Architecture, Load Balancing Mechanisms, Training Efficiency, Expert Choices <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel load balancing mechanism for Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models to enhance training efficiency. These models efficiently activate only a subset of parameters for each input, but without balancing mechanisms, routers may converge to using only a few experts, limiting model capacity. The proposed load balancing loss preserves token-wise relational structure, encouraging consistent expert choices for similar inputs during training. Experimental results show that incorporating this loss leads to 36% faster convergence and reduced redundancy compared to existing load balancing approaches. This improvement allows the model to better utilize its capacity and avoid learning redundant knowledge.  <div>
arXiv:2506.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models offer a scalable and efficient architecture for training large neural networks by activating only a subset of parameters ("experts") for each input. A learned router computes a distribution over these experts, and assigns input tokens to a small subset. However, without auxiliary balancing mechanisms, routers often converge to using only a few experts, severely limiting model capacity and degrading performance. Most current load balancing mechanisms encourage a distribution over experts that resembles a roughly uniform distribution of experts per token. During training, this can result in inconsistent routing behavior, resulting in the model spending its capacity to learn redundant knowledge. We address this by introducing a novel load balancing loss that preserves token-wise relational structure, encouraging consistent expert choices for similar inputs during training. Our experimental results show that applying our loss to the router results in 36% faster convergence and lower redundancy compared to a popular load balancing loss.

<div> Neural networks, scientific laws, black-box nature, process-based models, interpretability <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a framework called ScIReN that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning to enhance scientific discovery. Traditional neural networks lack transparency and do not adhere to known scientific laws, limiting their ability to provide scientific insights. Process-based models, while rooted in scientific principles, often require setting multiple parameters in an ad-hoc manner, leading to poor predictions across different scales. ScIReN addresses this issue by using an interpretable encoder to predict scientifically meaningful parameters and a process-based decoder to generate output variables. The framework also incorporates a hard-sigmoid constraint layer to ensure that latent parameters align with scientific priors. By embedding process-based models in ScIReN, researchers can uncover new scientific mechanisms hidden within black-box models while improving predictive accuracy. The article demonstrates the effectiveness of ScIReN in simulating organic carbon flow in soils and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. <div>
arXiv:2506.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are a powerful tool for learning patterns from data. However, they do not respect known scientific laws, nor can they reveal novel scientific insights due to their black-box nature. In contrast, scientific reasoning distills biological or physical principles from observations and controlled experiments, and quantitatively interprets them with process-based models made of mathematical equations. Yet, process-based models rely on numerous free parameters that must be set in an ad-hoc manner, and thus often fit observations poorly in cross-scale predictions. While prior work has embedded process-based models in conventional neural networks, discovering interpretable relationships between parameters in process-based models and input features is still a grand challenge for scientific discovery. We thus propose Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN), a fully-transparent framework that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning. An interpretable encoder predicts scientifically-meaningful latent parameters, which are then passed through a differentiable process-based decoder to predict labeled output variables. ScIReN also uses a novel hard-sigmoid constraint layer to restrict latent parameters to meaningful ranges defined by scientific prior knowledge, further enhancing its interpretability. While the embedded process-based model enforces established scientific knowledge, the encoder reveals new scientific mechanisms and relationships hidden in conventional black-box models. We apply ScIReN on two tasks: simulating the flow of organic carbon through soils, and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. In both tasks, ScIReN outperforms black-box networks in predictive accuracy while providing substantial scientific interpretability -- it can infer latent scientific mechanisms and their relationships with input features.

<div> Keywords: language generative models, selective generation, online learning algorithm, partial feedback, false discovery rate

Summary:
This article introduces a new approach to address the issue of falsified responses by large language generative models, known as selective generation. By selectively abstaining from answering when unsure, generators can control hallucination effects. The proposed online learning algorithm for selective generation under partial feedback leverages concepts from multi-armed bandit problems to provide a framework for learning in non-stochastic environments. A novel conversion lemma connects bandit algorithms to selective generation, allowing for regret guarantees to be linked to false discovery rate guarantees. The algorithm exploits the unique structure of selective generation for efficient feedback unlocking, leading to better convergence speed in practice. The efficacy of the algorithm is evaluated both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its ability to control false discovery rate while maintaining reasonable selection efficiency compared to baselines.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language generative models increasingly interact with humans, while their falsified responses raise concerns. To address this hallucination effect, selectively abstaining from answering, called selective generation, provides an effective way for generators to control the hallucination when it is unsure of their answers. However, as selective generators are interacting under non-stochastic environments and having partial feedback from users on selective generation (e.g., thumbs up or down on the selected answer), learning methods for selective generation under such practical setups are crucial but currently missing. To address these limitations, we propose an online learning algorithm for selective generation under partial feedback. In particular, as learning under partial feedback is well-studied by multi-armed bandit problems, we reduce selective generation to bandits and provide a novel conversion lemma from bandits back to selective generation to leverage any known bandit algorithms and theoretical properties. This mainly connects regret guarantees of bandits to false discovery rate (FDR) guarantees of selective generation for controlling hallucination. However, naively exploiting known bandit algorithms and their regret bounds suffers from slow convergence speed in practice due the nature of partial feedback. To overcome this, we exploit a unique structure of arms in selective generation for feedback unlocking, i.e., unlocking unknown feedback from observed feedback. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the efficacy of the proposed online selective generation algorithm under partial feedback over diverse data environment setups, resulting in controlling a desired FDR, while maintaining reasonable selection efficiency, i.e., the ratio of non-abstaining answers, compared to baselines.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenge of effectively finetuning Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for specific downstream tasks. Naive finetuning methods often lead to overfitting and suboptimal performance due to the diverse temporal patterns and multi-scale forecasting capabilities of TSFMs. The authors propose MultiScale FineTuning (MSFT), a framework that integrates multi-scale modeling into the finetuning process for encoder-based TSFMs. Experimental results on different backbones show that TSFMs finetuned with MSFT outperform naive and typical finetuning methods, as well as state-of-the-art deep learning methods. <div>

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance for time series forecasting. However, an important yet underexplored challenge is how to effectively finetune TSFMs on specific downstream tasks. While naive finetuning can yield performance gains, we argue that it falls short of fully leveraging TSFMs' capabilities, often resulting in overfitting and suboptimal performance. Given the diverse temporal patterns across sampling scales and the inherent multi-scale forecasting capabilities of TSFMs, we adopt a causal perspective to analyze finetuning process, through which we highlight the critical importance of explicitly modeling multiple scales and reveal the shortcomings of naive approaches. Focusing on \textit{encoder-based} TSFMs, we propose \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{\textsc{s}}cale \textbf{\textsc{f}}ine\textbf{\textsc{t}}uning (\textbf{MSFT}), a simple yet general framework that explicitly integrates multi-scale modeling into the finetuning process. Experimental results on three different backbones (\moirai, \moment\ and \units) demonstrate that TSFMs finetuned with MSFT not only outperform naive and typical parameter efficient finetuning methods but also surpass state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

Summary:
Various forms of sparse attention have been explored in transformers to address computational costs. Input-dependent sparse attention models appear to converge faster and generalize better than standard attention models. Input-agnostic sparse attention does not provide similar benefits. Concentrating a model's "semantic focus" with input-dependent sparse attention accelerates learning. Theoretical characterizations reveal the connection between softmax stability, Lipschitz properties of the loss function, and the impact of sparsity on attention mechanism stability. Input-agnostic sparse attention does not offer advantages, while input-dependent sparse attention can improve guarantees under certain conditions, which were validated in empirical evaluations. This study highlights the importance of considering learnability and generalization in the design of sparse attention mechanisms in transformers.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various forms of sparse attention have been explored to mitigate the quadratic computational and memory cost of the attention mechanism in transformers. We study sparse transformers not through a lens of efficiency but rather in terms of learnability and generalization. Empirically studying a range of attention mechanisms, we find that input-dependent sparse attention models appear to converge faster and generalize better than standard attention models, while input-agnostic sparse attention models show no such benefits -- a phenomenon that is robust across architectural and optimization hyperparameter choices. This can be interpreted as demonstrating that concentrating a model's "semantic focus" with respect to the tokens currently being considered (in the form of input-dependent sparse attention) accelerates learning. We develop a theoretical characterization of the conditions that explain this behavior. We establish a connection between the stability of the standard softmax and the loss function's Lipschitz properties, then show how sparsity affects the stability of the softmax and the subsequent convergence and generalization guarantees resulting from the attention mechanism. This allows us to theoretically establish that input-agnostic sparse attention does not provide any benefits. We also characterize conditions when semantic focus (input-dependent sparse attention) can provide improved guarantees, and we validate that these conditions are in fact met in our empirical evaluations.

Nodes are represented as multiple random walks, allowing the Transformer to extract node, edge, and graph representations.

Abstract: A foundation model like GPT elicits many emergent abilities, owing to the pre-training with broad inclusion of data and the use of the powerful Transformer architecture. While foundation models in natural languages are prevalent, can we build similar models for graphs? This paper describes an approach toward a graph foundation model that is pre-trained with diverse graph datasets by adapting the Transformer backbone. A central challenge toward this end is how a sequence model encodes graphs of varying sizes and from different domains. We propose representing a node as multiple random walks, such that the Transformer can extract node representations from sequences, which in turn form edge and graph representations. We develop a novel context prediction loss for these random walks and theoretically analyze their expressive power in distinguishing neighborhoods and graphs. We also demonstrate the pre-training of our model and its adaptation to downstream tasks, showcasing its potential as a foundation for processing and reasoning with graph-structured data.

This research explores the connection between Koopman operator approximation and linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). By incorporating lagged observations into the state, the study establishes equivalence between a structured Koopman operator and linear RNN updates. The SKOLR model proposed integrates learnable input signal spectral decomposition with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for measurement functions, implementing a structured Koopman operator through a parallel linear RNN stack. Numerical experiments on forecasting benchmarks and dynamical systems demonstrate the superior performance of this design, based on streamlined Koopman theory principles. <div>
arXiv:2506.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory provides a framework for nonlinear dynamical system analysis and time-series forecasting by mapping dynamics to a space of real-valued measurement functions, enabling a linear operator representation. Despite the advantage of linearity, the operator is generally infinite-dimensional. Therefore, the objective is to learn measurement functions that yield a tractable finite-dimensional Koopman operator approximation. In this work, we establish a connection between Koopman operator approximation and linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which have recently demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling. We show that by considering an extended state consisting of lagged observations, we can establish an equivalence between a structured Koopman operator and linear RNN updates. Building on this connection, we present SKOLR, which integrates a learnable spectral decomposition of the input signal with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the measurement functions and implements a structured Koopman operator via a highly parallel linear RNN stack.

<div> Graph Neural Networks, Model Architecture, Loss Functions, Evaluation Metrics, Performance Improvement 
Summary:
Hybrid loss functions outperform single loss functions in GNNs, showcasing the benefits of multi-objective optimization. The GIN architecture consistently shows the highest average performance, particularly with Cross-Entropy loss. Despite overall lower average ranks, models like GAT exhibit specialized strengths when paired with specific hybrid losses, excelling in certain task demands. In contrast, the MPNN architecture often falls short in comparison. The in-depth study highlights the importance of selecting the right combination of model architecture and loss function for optimal performance on non-Euclidean data tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) became useful for learning on non-Euclidean data. However, their best performance depends on choosing the right model architecture and the training objective, also called the loss function. Researchers have studied these parts separately, but a large-scale evaluation has not looked at how GNN models and many loss functions work together across different tasks. To fix this, we ran a thorough study - it included seven well-known GNN architectures. We also used a large group of 30 single plus mixed loss functions. The study looked at both inductive and transductive settings. Our evaluation spanned three distinct real-world datasets, assessing performance in both inductive and transductive settings using 21 comprehensive evaluation metrics. From these extensive results (detailed in supplementary information 1 \& 2), we meticulously analyzed the top ten model-loss combinations for each metric based on their average rank. Our findings reveal that, especially for the inductive case: 1) Hybrid loss functions generally yield superior and more robust performance compared to single loss functions, indicating the benefit of multi-objective optimization. 2) The GIN architecture always showed the highest-level average performance, especially with Cross-Entropy loss. 3) Although some combinations had overall lower average ranks, models such as GAT, particularly with certain hybrid losses, demonstrated incredible specialized strengths, maximizing the most top-1 results among the individual metrics, emphasizing subtle strengths for particular task demands. 4) On the other hand, the MPNN architecture typically lagged behind the scenarios it was tested against.

<div> contrastive learning, temporal betweenness centrality, graph neural network, class imbalance, efficient prediction

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach, CLGNN, for accurate and efficient prediction of Temporal Betweenness Centrality (TBC) in temporal networks. Existing methods struggle with imbalance and computational cost, leading to inaccurate predictions. CLGNN addresses these challenges by utilizing contrastive learning to handle class imbalance and introducing dual aggregation mechanisms for encoding structural and temporal features. The model also incorporates a stability-based clustering-guided module to separate nodes based on centrality in representation space. Additionally, CLGNN supports multiple optimal path definitions to capture diverse temporal semantics. Experimental results show that CLGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving significant speedups and higher correlation values. This approach demonstrates the potential for effectively predicting TBC in real-world temporal networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Betweenness Centrality (TBC) measures how often a node appears on optimal temporal paths, reflecting its importance in temporal networks. However, exact computation is highly expensive, and real-world TBC distributions are extremely imbalanced. The severe imbalance leads learning-based models to overfit to zero-centrality nodes, resulting in inaccurate TBC predictions and failure to identify truly central nodes. Existing graph neural network (GNN) methods either fail to handle such imbalance or ignore temporal dependencies altogether. To address these issues, we propose a scalable and inductive contrastive learning-based GNN (CLGNN) for accurate and efficient TBC prediction. CLGNN builds an instance graph to preserve path validity and temporal order, then encodes structural and temporal features using dual aggregation, i.e., mean and edge-to-node multi-head attention mechanisms, enhanced by temporal path count and time encodings. A stability-based clustering-guided contrastive module (KContrastNet) is introduced to separate high-, median-, and low-centrality nodes in representation space, mitigating class imbalance, while a regression module (ValueNet) estimates TBC values. CLGNN also supports multiple optimal path definitions to accommodate diverse temporal semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CLGNN across diverse benchmarks. CLGNN achieves up to a 663.7~$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art exact TBC computation methods. It outperforms leading static GNN baselines with up to 31.4~$\times$ lower MAE and 16.7~$\times$ higher Spearman correlation, and surpasses state-of-the-art temporal GNNs with up to 5.7~$\times$ lower MAE and 3.9~$\times$ higher Spearman correlation.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, fine-tuning, model upcycling, transfer learning, early stopping

Summary:
In the field of modern deep learning, the use of open-weight foundation models that can be fine-tuned on specific datasets has become prevalent. This has led to the development of expert models and adapters shared on platforms like HuggingFace and AdapterHub. Model upcycling methods have emerged, allowing for the reuse of fine-tuned models in multi-task systems. However, a study challenges the assumption that improvements in pre-training and fine-tuning stages propagate downstream. It was found that long fine-tuning of experts focusing on individual performance can lead to degradation in merging performance and downstream results when upcycled into more general systems. This degradation is attributed to the memorization of difficult examples during late fine-tuning steps. The study suggests that an early stopping strategy tailored to specific tasks can significantly enhance upcycling performance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modern deep learning is increasingly characterized by the use of open-weight foundation models that can be fine-tuned on specialized datasets. This has led to a proliferation of expert models and adapters, often shared via platforms like HuggingFace and AdapterHub. To leverage these resources, numerous model upcycling methods have emerged, enabling the reuse of fine-tuned models in multi-task systems. A natural pipeline has thus formed to harness the benefits of transfer learning and amortize sunk training costs: models are pre-trained on general data, fine-tuned on specific tasks, and then upcycled into more general-purpose systems. A prevailing assumption is that improvements at one stage of this pipeline propagate downstream, leading to gains at subsequent steps. In this work, we challenge that assumption by examining how expert fine-tuning affects model upcycling. We show that long fine-tuning of experts that optimizes for their individual performance leads to degraded merging performance, both for fully fine-tuned and LoRA-adapted models, and to worse downstream results when LoRA adapters are upcycled into MoE layers. We trace this degradation to the memorization of a small set of difficult examples that dominate late fine-tuning steps and are subsequently forgotten during merging. Finally, we demonstrate that a task-dependent aggressive early stopping strategy can significantly improve upcycling performance.

<div> representation, decision trees, predictive equivalence, variable importance, missing values

Summary:
The article discusses the challenge of predictive equivalence in decision trees, where different trees can have the same decision boundary but different evaluation processes. The authors propose a boolean logical representation of decision trees that eliminates this issue and accurately represents the underlying decision boundary. They demonstrate the robustness of decision trees to missing feature values at test time using this representation. The impact of predictive equivalence on quantifying variable importance is also addressed, highlighting the need for a more accurate approach. Additionally, an algorithm is presented to optimize the cost of reaching predictions, providing a more efficient method for decision tree optimization. Overall, the new representation offers a solution to the predictive equivalence problem and improves the interpretation and performance of decision trees in various machine learning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees are widely used for interpretable machine learning due to their clearly structured reasoning process. However, this structure belies a challenge we refer to as predictive equivalence: a given tree's decision boundary can be represented by many different decision trees. The presence of models with identical decision boundaries but different evaluation processes makes model selection challenging. The models will have different variable importance and behave differently in the presence of missing values, but most optimization procedures will arbitrarily choose one such model to return. We present a boolean logical representation of decision trees that does not exhibit predictive equivalence and is faithful to the underlying decision boundary. We apply our representation to several downstream machine learning tasks. Using our representation, we show that decision trees are surprisingly robust to test-time missingness of feature values; we address predictive equivalence's impact on quantifying variable importance; and we present an algorithm to optimize the cost of reaching predictions.

<div> Keywords: programmatic representations, sequential decision-making, out-of-distribution problems, neural policies, OOD generalization

Summary:
In this position paper, the authors challenge the notion that programmatic policies are superior in generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems compared to neural policies. Through an analysis of existing literature, they demonstrate that neural policies can achieve similar levels of generalization as programmatic policies with simple modifications to their training pipeline. By utilizing simpler neural architectures and different reward functions that encourage safer behaviors, neural policies can improve OOD generalization. The authors also argue for the creation of benchmark problems that specifically test concepts necessary for OOD generalization, such as tasks that require algorithmic constructs like stacks. This study highlights the importance of reevaluating the perceived advantages of programmatic representations in solving sequential decision-making problems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms for learning programmatic representations for sequential decision-making problems are often evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, with the common conclusion that programmatic policies generalize better than neural policies on OOD problems. In this position paper, we argue that commonly used benchmarks undervalue the generalization capabilities of programmatic representations. We analyze the experiments of four papers from the literature and show that neural policies, which were shown not to generalize, can generalize as effectively as programmatic policies on OOD problems. This is achieved with simple changes in the neural policies training pipeline. Namely, we show that simpler neural architectures with the same type of sparse observation used with programmatic policies can help attain OOD generalization. Another modification we have shown to be effective is the use of reward functions that allow for safer policies (e.g., agents that drive slowly can generalize better). Also, we argue for creating benchmark problems highlighting concepts needed for OOD generalization that may challenge neural policies but align with programmatic representations, such as tasks requiring algorithmic constructs like stacks.

Abstract: This paper investigates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in a partially observable, cooperative-competitive combat environment known as LAG. We describe the environment's setup, including agent actions, hierarchical controls, and reward design across different combat modes such as No Weapon and ShootMissile. Two representative algorithms are evaluated: HAPPO, an on-policy hierarchical variant of PPO, and HASAC, an off-policy method based on soft actor-critic. We analyze their training stability, reward progression, and inter-agent coordination capabilities. Experimental results show that HASAC performs well in simpler coordination tasks without weapons, while HAPPO demonstrates stronger adaptability in more dynamic and expressive scenarios involving missile combat. These findings provide insights into the trade-offs between on-policy and off-policy methods in multi-agent settings.

Summary: The article adapts the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to generative modeling by using a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network generator with independent energy-based priors. Through inverse transform sampling, fast inference is enabled, and prior knowledge can be incorporated pre-training to align priors with posteriors for improved learning efficiency and sample quality. The approach connects classical representation theorems with modern probabilistic modeling, maintaining a balance between training stability, inference speed, and the quality and diversity of generated samples. Scalable extensions based on mixture distributions and Langevin Monte Carlo methods are introduced to address inflexibility and mitigate prior-posterior mismatch, allowing for a trade-off between flexibility and training efficiency.

Abstract: We adapt the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to generative modeling by reinterpreting its inner functions as a Markov Kernel between probability spaces via inverse transform sampling. We present a generative model that is interpretable, easy to design, and efficient. Our approach couples a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network generator with independent energy-based priors, trained via Maximum Likelihood. Inverse sampling enables fast inference, while prior knowledge can be incorporated before training to better align priors with posteriors, thereby improving learning efficiency and sample quality. The learned prior is also recoverable and visualizable post-training, offering an empirical Bayes perspective. To address inflexibility and mitigate prior-posterior mismatch, we introduce scalable extensions based on mixture distributions and Langevin Monte Carlo methods, admitting a trade-off between flexibility and training efficiency. Our contributions connect classical representation theorems with modern probabilistic modeling, while balancing training stability, inference speed, and the quality and diversity of generations.

The article introduces a theory for generating out-of-distribution (OOD) detection features for neural networks. By utilizing a novel information-theoretic loss function with two terms - one based on KL divergence and the other on the Information Bottleneck principle, the model is able to distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and OOD feature distributions while retaining OOD information in a compressed format. Through a variational optimization procedure, OOD features are obtained, allowing for the prediction of new shaping functions that surpass existing methods on OOD benchmarks. This framework offers a versatile approach for creating a range of explainable features with application in OOD detection.

Abstract: We present a theory for the construction of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection features for neural networks. We introduce random features for OOD through a novel information-theoretic loss functional consisting of two terms, the first based on the KL divergence separates resulting in-distribution (ID) and OOD feature distributions and the second term is the Information Bottleneck, which favors compressed features that retain the OOD information. We formulate a variational procedure to optimize the loss and obtain OOD features. Based on assumptions on OOD distributions, one can recover properties of existing OOD features, i.e., shaping functions. Furthermore, we show that our theory can predict a new shaping function that out-performs existing ones on OOD benchmarks. Our theory provides a general framework for constructing a variety of new features with clear explainability.

Training large neural networks using traditional end-to-end backpropagation methods leads to memory bottlenecks, hindering widespread access to advanced AI research. The proposed DiffusionBlocks framework offers a novel approach by viewing neural network blocks as denoising operations within a continuous diffusion process. By dividing the network into independently trainable blocks and optimizing noise levels based on equal cumulative probability mass, DiffusionBlocks achieves substantial memory efficiency without sacrificing performance in generative tasks. Experimental results on image generation and language modeling tasks show that memory usage decreases in proportion to the number of blocks while still delivering superior results. This innovative framework opens up possibilities for making large-scale neural network training more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources. <br /> <div>

We propose $\textit{DiffusionBlocks}$, a novel training framework that interprets neural network blocks as performing denoising operations in a continuous-time diffusion process. By partitioning the network into independently trainable blocks and optimizing noise level assignments based on equal cumulative probability mass, our approach achieves significant memory efficiency while maintaining competitive performance compared to traditional backpropagation in generative tasks. Experiments on image generation and language modeling tasks demonstrate memory reduction proportional to the number of blocks while achieving superior performance. DiffusionBlocks provides a promising pathway for democratizing access to large-scale neural network training with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often achieve high accuracy, but ensuring their reliability under adversarial and distributional shifts remains a pressing challenge. We propose TriGuard, a unified safety evaluation framework that combines (1) formal robustness verification, (2) attribution entropy to quantify saliency concentration, and (3) a novel Attribution Drift Score measuring explanation stability. TriGuard reveals critical mismatches between model accuracy and interpretability: verified models can still exhibit unstable reasoning, and attribution-based signals provide complementary safety insights beyond adversarial accuracy. Extensive experiments across three datasets and five architectures show how TriGuard uncovers subtle fragilities in neural reasoning. We further demonstrate that entropy-regularized training reduces explanation drift without sacrificing performance. TriGuard advances the frontier in robust, interpretable model evaluation.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to estimate the homophily of a graph, enhancing the performance of Spectral Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs). By leveraging LLMs to generate homophily-aware priors, the filters in SGNNs are adaptively designed to better align with the underlying graph topology. The proposed LLM-driven SGNN framework outperforms existing baselines in both homophilic and heterophilic settings on benchmark datasets. This approach provides improved expressiveness and adaptability for SGNNs across diverse graph structures. The lightweight pipeline developed in this study incurs minimal computational and monetary overhead, making it a practical and efficient solution for enhancing the performance of SGNNs. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have attracted significant attention due to their ability to approximate arbitrary filters. They typically rely on supervision from downstream tasks to adaptively learn appropriate filters. However, under label-scarce conditions, SGNNs may learn suboptimal filters, leading to degraded performance. Meanwhile, the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inspired growing interest in exploring their potential within the GNN domain. This naturally raises an important question: \textit{Can LLMs help overcome the limitations of SGNNs and enhance their performance?} In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages LLMs to estimate the homophily of a given graph. The estimated homophily is then used to adaptively guide the design of polynomial spectral filters, thereby improving the expressiveness and adaptability of SGNNs across diverse graph structures. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight pipeline in which the LLM generates homophily-aware priors, which are injected into the filter coefficients to better align with the underlying graph topology. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our LLM-driven SGNN framework consistently outperforms existing baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic settings, with minimal computational and monetary overhead.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces DP-Ditto, a personalized federated learning approach that incorporates differential privacy to protect client privacy. It addresses the trade-off between privacy guarantee, model convergence, and performance distribution fairness in personalized learning. The convergence upper bound of personalized models under DP-Ditto is analyzed, determining the optimal number of global aggregations for a given privacy budget. Performance fairness is also assessed, showing the potential for joint optimization of DP-Ditto for convergence and fairness. Experimental results indicate that DP-Ditto outperforms DP-perturbed versions of other state-of-the-art PFL models in terms of fairness and accuracy, surpassing them by 32.71% and 9.66%, respectively. <div>

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL), e.g., the renowned Ditto, strikes a balance between personalization and generalization by conducting federated learning (FL) to guide personalized learning (PL). While FL is unaffected by personalized model training, in Ditto, PL depends on the outcome of the FL. However, the clients' concern about their privacy and consequent perturbation of their local models can affect the convergence and (performance) fairness of PL. This paper presents PFL, called DP-Ditto, which is a non-trivial extension of Ditto under the protection of differential privacy (DP), and analyzes the trade-off among its privacy guarantee, model convergence, and performance distribution fairness. We also analyze the convergence upper bound of the personalized models under DP-Ditto and derive the optimal number of global aggregations given a privacy budget. Further, we analyze the performance fairness of the personalized models, and reveal the feasibility of optimizing DP-Ditto jointly for convergence and fairness. Experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate that DP-Ditto can surpass the DP-perturbed versions of the state-of-the-art PFL models, such as FedAMP, pFedMe, APPLE, and FedALA, by over 32.71% in fairness and 9.66% in accuracy.

Abstract: Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in large language models by leveraging internal model representations rather than relying solely on black-box outputs. These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions, but a critical open question remains: can LLMs learn to evade such monitors? To study this, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to bypass latent-space monitors while maintaining coherent generations. We apply RL-Obfuscation to LLMs ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate evasion success against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level latent-space monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack. More holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, we show that adversarial policies trained to evade a single static monitor generalise to unseen monitors of the same type. Finally, we study how the policy learned by RL bypasses these monitors and find that the model can also learn to repurpose tokens to mean something different internally.

Abstract: Adaptation is the holy grail of intelligence, but even the best AI models (like GPT) lack the adaptivity of toddlers. So the question remains: how can machines adapt quickly? Despite a lot of progress on model adaptation to facilitate continual and federated learning, as well as model merging, editing, unlearning, etc., little is known about the mechanisms by which machines can naturally learn to adapt in a similar way as humans and animals. Here, we show that all such adaptation methods can be seen as different ways of `correcting' the approximate posteriors. More accurate posteriors lead to smaller corrections, which in turn imply quicker adaptation. The result is obtained by using a dual-perspective of the Bayesian Learning Rule of Khan and Rue (2023) where interference created during adaptation is characterized by the natural-gradient mismatch over the past data. We present many examples to demonstrate the use of posterior-correction as a natural mechanism for the machines to learn to adapt quickly.

Abstract: Learning to optimize (L2O) is an emerging technique to solve mathematical optimization problems with learning-based methods. Although with great success in many real-world scenarios such as wireless communications, computer networks, and electronic design, existing L2O works lack theoretical demonstration of their performance and robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We address this gap by providing comprehensive proofs. First, we prove a sufficient condition for a robust L2O model with homogeneous convergence rates over all In-Distribution (InD) instances. We assume an L2O model achieves robustness for an InD scenario. Based on our proposed methodology of aligning OOD problems to InD problems, we also demonstrate that the L2O model's convergence rate in OOD scenarios will deteriorate by an equation of the L2O model's input features. Moreover, we propose an L2O model with a concise gradient-only feature construction and a novel gradient-based history modeling method. Numerical simulation demonstrates that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in both InD and OOD scenarios and achieves up to 10 $\times$ convergence speedup.

Abstract: Bayesian methods have recently been used to improve LoRA finetuning and, although they improve calibration, their effect on other metrics (such as accuracy) is marginal and can sometimes even be detrimental. Moreover, Bayesian methods also increase computational overheads and require additional tricks for them to work well. Here, we fix these issues by using a recently proposed variational algorithm called IVON. We show that IVON is easy to implement and has similar costs to AdamW, and yet it can also drastically improve many metrics by using a simple posterior pruning technique. We present extensive results on billion-scale LLMs (Llama and Qwen series) going way beyond the scale of existing applications of IVON. For example, we finetune a Llama-3.2-3B model on a set of commonsense reasoning tasks and improve accuracy over AdamW by 1.3% and reduce ECE by 5.4%, outperforming AdamW and other recent Bayesian methods like Laplace-LoRA and BLoB. Overall, our results show that variational learning with IVON can effectively improve LoRA finetuning.

<title>Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.

Abstract: Fairness has been identified as an important aspect of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence solutions for decision making. Recent literature offers a variety of approaches for debiasing, however many of them fall short when the data collection is imbalanced. In this paper, we focus on a particular case, fairness in doubly imbalanced datasets, such that the data collection is imbalanced both for the label and the groups in the sensitive attribute. Firstly, we present an exploratory analysis to illustrate limitations in debiasing on a doubly imbalanced dataset. Then, a multi-criteria based solution is proposed for finding the most suitable sampling and distribution for label and sensitive attribute, in terms of fairness and classification accuracy

<title>IntelliLung: Advancing Safe Mechanical Ventilation using Offline RL with Hybrid Actions and Clinically Aligned Rewards</title>

Abstract: Invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life-sustaining therapy for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, optimizing its settings remains a complex and error-prone process due to patient-specific variability. While Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows promise for MV control, current stateof-the-art (SOTA) methods struggle with the hybrid (continuous and discrete) nature of MV actions. Discretizing the action space limits available actions due to exponential growth in combinations and introduces distribution shifts that can compromise safety. In this paper, we propose optimizations that build upon prior work in action space reduction to address the challenges of discrete action spaces. We also adapt SOTA offline RL algorithms (IQL and EDAC) to operate directly on hybrid action spaces, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of discretization. Additionally, we introduce a clinically grounded reward function based on ventilator-free days and physiological targets, which provides a more meaningful optimization objective compared to traditional sparse mortality-based rewards. Our findings demonstrate that AI-assisted MV optimization may enhance patient safety and enable individualized lung support, representing a significant advancement toward intelligent, data-driven critical care solutions.

Abstract: Residual connections remain ubiquitous in modern neural network architectures nearly a decade after their introduction. Their widespread adoption is often credited to their dramatically improved trainability: residual networks train faster, more stably, and achieve higher accuracy than their feedforward counterparts. While numerous techniques, ranging from improved initialization to advanced learning rate schedules, have been proposed to close the performance gap between residual and feedforward networks, this gap has persisted. In this work, we propose an alternative explanation: residual networks do not merely reparameterize feedforward networks, but instead inhabit a different function space. We design a controlled post-training comparison to isolate generalization performance from trainability; we find that variable-depth architectures, similar to ResNets, consistently outperform fixed-depth networks, even when optimization is unlikely to make a difference. These results suggest that residual connections confer performance advantages beyond optimization, pointing instead to a deeper inductive bias aligned with the structure of natural data.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making and trusting the reliability of Deep Machine Learning Models is crucial for adopting such methods to safety-relevant applications. We extend self-explainable Prototypical Variational models with autoencoder-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detection: A Variational Autoencoder is applied to learn a meaningful latent space which can be used for distance-based classification, likelihood estimation for OOD detection, and reconstruction. The In-Distribution (ID) region is defined by a Gaussian mixture distribution with learned prototypes representing the center of each mode. Furthermore, a novel restriction loss is introduced that promotes a compact ID region in the latent space without collapsing it into single points. The reconstructive capabilities of the Autoencoder ensure the explainability of the prototypes and the ID region of the classifier, further aiding the discrimination of OOD samples. Extensive evaluations on common OOD detection benchmarks as well as a large-scale dataset from a real-world railway application demonstrate the usefulness of the approach, outperforming previous methods.

<title>HiLight: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework with Global Adversarial Guidance for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control</title>

Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to support clinical decision-making. However, real-world medical datasets are often noisy, incomplete, and imbalanced, leading to performance disparities across patient subgroups. These differences raise fairness concerns, particularly when they reinforce existing disadvantages for marginalized groups. In this work, we analyze several medical prediction tasks and demonstrate how model performance varies with patient characteristics. While ML models may demonstrate good overall performance, we argue that subgroup-level evaluation is essential before integrating them into clinical workflows. By conducting a performance analysis at the subgroup level, differences can be clearly identified-allowing, on the one hand, for performance disparities to be considered in clinical practice, and on the other hand, for these insights to inform the responsible development of more effective models. Thereby, our work contributes to a practical discussion around the subgroup-sensitive development and deployment of medical ML models and the interconnectedness of fairness and transparency.

<title>Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Unobservable Random Delays</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.14411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings, the interaction between the agent and the environment is typically modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that the agent observes the system state instantaneously, selects an action without delay, and executes it immediately. In real-world dynamic environments, such as cyber-physical systems, this assumption often breaks down due to delays in the interaction between the agent and the system. These delays can vary stochastically over time and are typically unobservable, meaning they are unknown when deciding on an action. Existing methods deal with this uncertainty conservatively by assuming a known fixed upper bound on the delay, even if the delay is often much lower. In this work, we introduce the interaction layer, a general framework that enables agents to adaptively and seamlessly handle unobservable and time-varying delays. Specifically, the agent generates a matrix of possible future actions to handle both unpredictable delays and lost action packets sent over networks. Building on this framework, we develop a model-based algorithm, Actor-Critic with Delay Adaptation (ACDA), which dynamically adjusts to delay patterns. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a wide range of locomotion benchmark environments.

Abstract: Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to discover diverse behaviors that can accelerate the learning of downstream tasks. Previous methods typically focus on entropy-based exploration or empowerment-driven skill learning. However, entropy-based exploration struggles in large-scale state spaces (e.g., images), and empowerment-based methods with Mutual Information (MI) estimations have limitations in state exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel skill discovery objective that maximizes the deviation of the state density of one skill from the explored regions of other skills, encouraging inter-skill state diversity similar to the initial MI objective. For state-density estimation, we construct a novel conditional autoencoder with soft modularization for different skill policies in high-dimensional space. Meanwhile, to incentivize intra-skill exploration, we formulate an intrinsic reward based on the learned autoencoder that resembles count-based exploration in a compact latent space. Through extensive experiments in challenging state and image-based tasks, we find our method learns meaningful skills and achieves superior performance in various downstream tasks.

<title>MoORE: SVD-based Model MoE-ization for Conflict- and Oblivion-Resistant Multi-Task Adaptation</title>

arXiv:2506.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation models in multi-task scenarios often suffers from task conflict and oblivion. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel ''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant multi-task adaptation method. Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our method applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its singular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix becomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert corresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the corresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a learnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts' orthogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix. These two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among the new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that MoORE outperforms existing multi-task adaptation methods consistently, showing its superiority in terms of conflict- and oblivion-resistance. The code of the experiments is available at https://github.com/DaShenZi721/MoORE.

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex, structured data, particularly where hierarchical or tree-like relationships are present. By enabling embeddings with lower distortion, hyperbolic neural networks offer promising alternatives to Euclidean-based models for capturing intricate data structures. Despite these advantages, they often face performance challenges, particularly in computational efficiency and tasks requiring high precision. In this work, we address these limitations by simplifying key operations within hyperbolic neural networks, achieving notable improvements in both runtime and performance. Our findings demonstrate that streamlined hyperbolic operations can lead to substantial gains in computational speed and predictive accuracy, making hyperbolic neural networks a more viable choice for a broader range of applications.

<title>A General Framework for Off-Policy Learning with Partially-Observed Reward</title>

Abstract: Off-policy learning (OPL) in contextual bandits aims to learn a decision-making policy that maximizes the target rewards by using only historical interaction data collected under previously developed policies. Unfortunately, when rewards are only partially observed, the effectiveness of OPL degrades severely. Well-known examples of such partial rewards include explicit ratings in content recommendations, conversion signals on e-commerce platforms that are partial due to delay, and the issue of censoring in medical problems. One possible solution to deal with such partial rewards is to use secondary rewards, such as dwelling time, clicks, and medical indicators, which are more densely observed. However, relying solely on such secondary rewards can also lead to poor policy learning since they may not align with the target reward. Thus, this work studies a new and general problem of OPL where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected target reward by leveraging densely observed secondary rewards as supplemental data. We then propose a new method called Hybrid Policy Optimization for Partially-Observed Reward (HyPeR), which effectively uses the secondary rewards in addition to the partially-observed target reward to achieve effective OPL despite the challenging scenario. We also discuss a case where we aim to optimize not only the expected target reward but also the expected secondary rewards to some extent; counter-intuitively, we will show that leveraging the two objectives is in fact advantageous also for the optimization of only the target reward. Along with statistical analysis of our proposed methods, empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data show that HyPeR outperforms existing methods in various scenarios.

<title>Detecting immune cells with label-free two-photon autofluorescence and deep learning</title>

Abstract: Label-free imaging has gained broad interest because of its potential to omit elaborate staining procedures which is especially relevant for in vivo use. Label-free multiphoton microscopy (MPM), for instance, exploits two-photon excitation of natural autofluorescence (AF) from native, metabolic proteins, making it ideal for in vivo endomicroscopy. Deep learning (DL) models have been widely used in other optical imaging technologies to predict specific target annotations and thereby digitally augment the specificity of these label-free images. However, this computational specificity has only rarely been implemented for MPM. In this work, we used a data set of label-free MPM images from a series of different immune cell types (5,075 individual cells for binary classification in mixed samples and 3,424 cells for a multi-class classification task) and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify cell types based on this label-free AF as input. A low-complexity squeezeNet architecture was able to achieve reliable immune cell classification results (0.89 ROC-AUC, 0.95 PR-AUC, for binary classification in mixed samples; 0.689 F1 score, 0.697 precision, 0.748 recall, and 0.683 MCC for six-class classification in isolated samples). Perturbation tests confirmed that the model is not confused by extracellular environment and that both input AF channels (NADH and FAD) are about equally important to the classification. In the future, such predictive DL models could directly detect specific immune cells in unstained images and thus, computationally improve the specificity of label-free MPM which would have great potential for in vivo endomicroscopy.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to compress training data into fewer examples via a teacher, from which a student can learn effectively. While its success is often attributed to structure in the data, modern neural networks also memorize specific facts, but if and how such memorized information is can transferred in distillation settings remains less understood. In this work, we show that students trained on soft labels from teachers can achieve non-trivial accuracy on held-out memorized data they never directly observed. This effect persists on structured data when the teacher has not generalized.To analyze it in isolation, we consider finite random i.i.d. datasets where generalization is a priori impossible and a successful teacher fit implies pure memorization. Still, students can learn non-trivial information about the held-out data, in some cases up to perfect accuracy. In those settings, enough soft labels are available to recover the teacher functionally - the student matches the teacher's predictions on all possible inputs, including the held-out memorized data. We show that these phenomena strongly depend on the temperature with which the logits are smoothed, but persist across varying network capacities, architectures and dataset compositions.

Abstract: Depression is a significant mental health concern, particularly in professional environments where work-related stress, financial pressure, and lifestyle imbalances contribute to deteriorating well-being. Despite increasing awareness, researchers and practitioners face critical challenges in developing accurate and generalizable predictive models for mental health disorders. Traditional classification approaches often struggle with the complexity of depression, as it is influenced by multifaceted, interdependent factors, including occupational stress, sleep patterns, and job satisfaction. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a stacking-based ensemble learning approach to improve the predictive accuracy of depression classification among professionals. The Depression Professional Dataset has been collected from Kaggle. The dataset comprises demographic, occupational, and lifestyle attributes that influence mental well-being. Our stacking model integrates multiple base learners with a logistic regression-mediated model, effectively capturing diverse learning patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high predictive performance, with an accuracy of 99.64% on training data and 98.75% on testing data, with precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 98%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning in mental health analytics and underscore its potential for early detection and intervention strategies.

Abstract: Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO) provides powerful tools for optimizing functions where explicit gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. However, the underlying mechanisms of popular ZOO methods, particularly those employing randomized finite differences, and their connection to other optimization paradigms like Reinforcement Learning (RL) are not fully elucidated. This paper establishes a fundamental and previously unrecognized connection: ZOO with finite differences is equivalent to a specific instance of single-step Policy Optimization (PO). We formally unveil that the implicitly smoothed objective function optimized by common ZOO algorithms is identical to a single-step PO objective. Furthermore, we show that widely used ZOO gradient estimators, are mathematically equivalent to the REINFORCE gradient estimator with a specific baseline function, revealing the variance-reducing mechanism in ZOO from a PO perspective.Built on this unified framework, we propose ZoAR (Zeroth-Order Optimization with Averaged Baseline and Query Reuse), a novel ZOO algorithm incorporating PO-inspired variance reduction techniques: an averaged baseline from recent evaluations and query reuse analogous to experience replay. Our theoretical analysis further substantiates these techniques reduce variance and enhance convergence. Extensive empirical studies validate our theory and demonstrate that ZoAR significantly outperforms other methods in terms of convergence speed and final performance. Overall, our work provides a new theoretical lens for understanding ZOO and offers practical algorithmic improvements derived from its connection to PO.

<title>Leveraging External Factors in Household-Level Electrical Consumption Forecasting using Hypernetworks</title>

Abstract: Accurate electrical consumption forecasting is crucial for efficient energy management and resource allocation. While traditional time series forecasting relies on historical patterns and temporal dependencies, incorporating external factors -- such as weather indicators -- has shown significant potential for improving prediction accuracy in complex real-world applications. However, the inclusion of these additional features often degrades the performance of global predictive models trained on entire populations, despite improving individual household-level models. To address this challenge, we found that a hypernetwork architecture can effectively leverage external factors to enhance the accuracy of global electrical consumption forecasting models, by specifically adjusting the model weights to each consumer.
  We collected a comprehensive dataset spanning two years, comprising consumption data from over 6000 luxembourgish households and corresponding external factors such as weather indicators, holidays, and major local events. By comparing various forecasting models, we demonstrate that a hypernetwork approach outperforms existing methods when associated to external factors, reducing forecasting errors and achieving the best accuracy while maintaining the benefits of a global model.

<title>Train Once, Forget Precisely: Anchored Optimization for Efficient Post-Hoc Unlearning</title>

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly rely on data subject to privacy regulation, selectively unlearning specific information from trained models has become essential. In image classification, this involves removing the influence of particular training samples, semantic classes, or visual styles without full retraining. We introduce \textbf{Forget-Aligned Model Reconstruction (FAMR)}, a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient framework for post-hoc unlearning in deep image classifiers. FAMR frames forgetting as a constrained optimization problem that minimizes a uniform-prediction loss on the forget set while anchoring model parameters to their original values via an $\ell_2$ penalty. A theoretical analysis links FAMR's solution to influence-function-based retraining approximations, with bounds on parameter and output deviation. Empirical results on class forgetting tasks using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 demonstrate FAMR's effectiveness, with strong performance retention and minimal computational overhead. The framework generalizes naturally to concept and style erasure, offering a scalable and certifiable route to efficient post-hoc forgetting in vision models.

Abstract: We study a two-player zero-sum game (TPZSG) in which the row player aims to maximize their payoff against an adversarial column player, under an unknown payoff matrix estimated through bandit feedback. We propose and analyze two algorithms: ETC-TPZSG, which directly applies ETC to the TPZSG setting and ETC-TPZSG-AE, which improves upon it by incorporating an action pair elimination (AE) strategy that leverages the $\varepsilon$-Nash Equilibrium property to efficiently select the optimal action pair. Our objective is to demonstrate the applicability of ETC in a TPZSG setting by focusing on learning pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. A key contribution of our work is a derivation of instance-dependent upper bounds on the expected regret for both algorithms, has received limited attention in the literature on zero-sum games. Particularly, after $T$ rounds, we achieve an instance-dependent regret upper bounds of $O(\Delta + \sqrt{T})$ for ETC-TPZSG and $O(\frac{\log (T \Delta^2)}{\Delta})$ for ETC-TPZSG-AE, where $\Delta$ denotes the suboptimality gap. Therefore, our results indicate that ETC-based algorithms perform effectively in adversarial game settings, achieving regret bounds comparable to existing methods while providing insights through instance-dependent analysis.

Abstract: Are current artificial intelligence (AI) research methodologies ready to create successful, productive, and profitable AI applications? This work presents a case study on an industrial AI use case called false call reduction for automated optical inspection to demonstrate the shortcomings of current best practices. We identify seven weaknesses prevalent in related peer-reviewed work and experimentally show their consequences. We show that the best-practice methodology would fail for this use case. We argue amongst others for the necessity of requirement-aware metrics to ensure achieving business objectives, clear definitions of success criteria, and a thorough analysis of temporal dynamics in experimental datasets. Our work encourages researchers to critically assess their methodologies for more successful applied AI research.

Abstract: Effective decision-making on networks often relies on learning from graph-structured data, where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) play a central role, but they take efforts to configure and tune. In this demo, we propose LLMNet, showing how to design GNN automated through Large Language Models. Our system develops a set of agents that construct graph-related knowlege bases and then leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support automated configuration and refinement of GNN models through a knowledge-guided evolution process. These agents, equipped with specialized knowledge bases, extract insights into tasks and graph structures by interacting with the knowledge bases. Empirical results show LLMNet excels in twelve datasets across three graph learning tasks, validating its effectiveness of GNN model designing.

<title>Aligning Evaluation with Clinical Priorities: Calibration, Label Shift, and Error Costs</title>

Abstract: Machine learning-based decision support systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, where probabilistic scoring functions are used to inform and prioritize patient management decisions. However, widely used scoring rules, such as accuracy and AUC-ROC, fail to adequately reflect key clinical priorities, including calibration, robustness to distributional shifts, and sensitivity to asymmetric error costs. In this work, we propose a principled yet practical evaluation framework for selecting calibrated thresholded classifiers that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in class prevalences and domain-specific cost asymmetries often found in clinical settings. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, particularly the Schervish representation, we derive an adjusted variant of cross-entropy (log score) that averages cost-weighted performance over clinically relevant ranges of class balance. The resulting evaluation is simple to apply, sensitive to clinical deployment conditions, and designed to prioritize models that are both calibrated and robust to real-world variations.

Abstract: We present the Gaussian process dynamical mixture model (GPDMM) and show its utility in single-example learning of human motion data. The Gaussian process dynamical model (GPDM) is a form of the Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM), but optimized with a hidden Markov model dynamical prior. The GPDMM combines multiple GPDMs in a probabilistic mixture-of-experts framework, utilizing embedded geometric features to allow for diverse sequences to be encoded in a single latent space, enabling the categorization and generation of each sequence class. GPDMs and our mixture model are particularly advantageous in addressing the challenges of modeling human movement in scenarios where data is limited and model interpretability is vital, such as in patient-specific medical applications like prosthesis control. We score the GPDMM on classification accuracy and generative ability in single-example learning, showcase model variations, and benchmark it against LSTMs, VAEs, and transformers.

<title>TGDPO: Harnessing Token-Level Reward Guidance for Enhancing Direct Preference Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14574</link>

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning from human feedback have shown that utilizing fine-grained token-level reward models can substantially enhance the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in aligning large language models. However, it is challenging to leverage such token-level reward as guidance for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), since DPO is formulated as a sequence-level bandit problem. To address this challenge, this work decomposes the sequence-level PPO into a sequence of token-level proximal policy optimization problems and then frames the problem of token-level PPO with token-level reward guidance, from which closed-form optimal token-level policy and the corresponding token-level reward can be derived. Using the obtained reward and Bradley-Terry model, this work establishes a framework of computable loss functions with token-level reward guidance for DPO, and proposes a practical reward guidance based on the induced DPO reward. This formulation enables different tokens to exhibit varying degrees of deviation from reference policy based on their respective rewards. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance improvements over DPO, with win rate gains of up to 7.5 points on MT-Bench, 6.2 points on AlpacaEval 2, and 4.3 points on Arena-Hard. Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/TGDPO.

Abstract: Over the last decade, as we rely more on deep learning technologies to make critical decisions, concerns regarding their safety, reliability and interpretability have emerged. We introduce a novel Neural Argumentative Learning (NAL) architecture that integrates Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) with deep learning for image analysis. Our architecture consists of neural and symbolic components. The former segments and encodes images into facts using object-centric learning, while the latter applies ABA learning to develop ABA frameworks enabling predictions with images. Experiments on synthetic data show that the NAL architecture can be competitive with a state-of-the-art alternative.

<title>SCISSOR: Mitigating Semantic Bias through Cluster-Aware Siamese Networks for Robust Classification</title>

Abstract: Shortcut learning undermines model generalization to out-of-distribution data. While the literature attributes shortcuts to biases in superficial features, we show that imbalances in the semantic distribution of sample embeddings induce spurious semantic correlations, compromising model robustness. To address this issue, we propose SCISSOR (Semantic Cluster Intervention for Suppressing ShORtcut), a Siamese network-based debiasing approach that remaps the semantic space by discouraging latent clusters exploited as shortcuts. Unlike prior data-debiasing approaches, SCISSOR eliminates the need for data augmentation and rewriting. We evaluate SCISSOR on 6 models across 4 benchmarks: Chest-XRay and Not-MNIST in computer vision, and GYAFC and Yelp in NLP tasks. Compared to several baselines, SCISSOR reports +5.3 absolute points in F1 score on GYAFC, +7.3 on Yelp, +7.7 on Chest-XRay, and +1 on Not-MNIST. SCISSOR is also highly advantageous for lightweight models with ~9.5% improvement on F1 for ViT on computer vision datasets and ~11.9% for BERT on NLP. Our study redefines the landscape of model generalization by addressing overlooked semantic biases, establishing SCISSOR as a foundational framework for mitigating shortcut learning and fostering more robust, bias-resistant AI systems.

<title>Deep Learning Surrogates for Real-Time Gas Emission Inversion</title>

Abstract: Real-time identification and quantification of greenhouse-gas emissions under transient atmospheric conditions is a critical challenge in environmental monitoring. We introduce a spatio-temporal inversion framework that embeds a deep-learning surrogate of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) within a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to perform Bayesian inference of both emission rate and source location in dynamic flow fields. By substituting costly numerical solvers with a multilayer perceptron trained on high-fidelity CFD outputs, our surrogate captures spatial heterogeneity and temporal evolution of gas dispersion, while delivering near-real-time predictions. Validation on the Chilbolton methane release dataset demonstrates comparable accuracy to full CFD solvers and Gaussian plume models, yet achieves orders-of-magnitude faster runtimes. Further experiments under simulated obstructed-flow scenarios confirm robustness in complex environments. This work reconciles physical fidelity with computational feasibility, offering a scalable solution for industrial emissions monitoring and other time-sensitive spatio-temporal inversion tasks in environmental and scientific modeling.

<title>Expressive Score-Based Priors for Distribution Matching with Geometry-Preserving Regularization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14607</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution matching (DM) is a versatile domain-invariant representation learning technique that has been applied to tasks such as fair classification, domain adaptation, and domain translation. Non-parametric DM methods struggle with scalability and adversarial DM approaches suffer from instability and mode collapse. While likelihood-based methods are a promising alternative, they often impose unnecessary biases through fixed priors or require explicit density models (e.g., flows) that can be challenging to train. We address this limitation by introducing a novel approach to training likelihood-based DM using expressive score-based prior distributions. Our key insight is that gradient-based DM training only requires the prior's score function -- not its density -- allowing us to train the prior via denoising score matching. This approach eliminates biases from fixed priors (e.g., in VAEs), enabling more effective use of geometry-preserving regularization, while avoiding the challenge of learning an explicit prior density model (e.g., a flow-based prior). Our method also demonstrates better stability and computational efficiency compared to other diffusion-based priors (e.g., LSGM). Furthermore, experiments demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks, establishing our score-based method as a stable and effective approach to distribution matching.

<title>Feasibility-Driven Trust Region Bayesian Optimization</title>

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for solving real-world optimization tasks under tight evaluation budgets, making it well-suited for applications involving costly simulations or experiments. However, many of these tasks are also characterized by the presence of expensive constraints whose analytical formulation is unknown and often defined in high-dimensional spaces where feasible regions are small, irregular, and difficult to identify. In such cases, a substantial portion of the optimization budget may be spent just trying to locate the first feasible solution, limiting the effectiveness of existing methods. In this work, we present a Feasibility-Driven Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO) algorithm. FuRBO iteratively defines a trust region from which the next candidate solution is selected, using information from both the objective and constraint surrogate models. Our adaptive strategy allows the trust region to shift and resize significantly between iterations, enabling the optimizer to rapidly refocus its search and consistently accelerate the discovery of feasible and good-quality solutions. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FuRBO through extensive testing on the full BBOB-constrained COCO benchmark suite and other physics-inspired benchmarks, comparing it against state-of-the-art baselines for constrained black-box optimization across varying levels of constraint severity and problem dimensionalities ranging from 2 to 60.

Abstract: Visual counterfactual explainers (VCEs) are a straightforward and promising approach to enhancing the transparency of image classifiers. VCEs complement other types of explanations, such as feature attribution, by revealing the specific data transformations to which a machine learning model responds most strongly. In this paper, we argue that existing VCEs focus too narrowly on optimizing sample quality or change minimality; they fail to consider the more holistic desiderata for an explanation, such as fidelity, understandability, and sufficiency. To address this shortcoming, we explore new mechanisms for counterfactual generation and investigate how they can help fulfill these desiderata. We combine these mechanisms into a novel 'smooth counterfactual explorer' (SCE) algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness through systematic evaluations on synthetic and real data.

<title>On the Hardness of Bandit Learning</title>

Abstract: We study the task of bandit learning, also known as best-arm identification, under the assumption that the true reward function f belongs to a known, but arbitrary, function class F. We seek a general theory of bandit learnability, akin to the PAC framework for classification. Our investigation is guided by the following two questions: (1) which classes F are learnable, and (2) how they are learnable. For example, in the case of binary PAC classification, learnability is fully determined by a combinatorial dimension - the VC dimension- and can be attained via a simple algorithmic principle, namely, empirical risk minimization (ERM). In contrast to classical learning-theoretic results, our findings reveal limitations of learning in structured bandits, offering insights into the boundaries of bandit learnability. First, for the question of "which", we show that the paradigm of identifying the learnable classes via a dimension-like quantity fails for bandit learning. We give a simple proof demonstrating that no combinatorial dimension can characterize bandit learnability, even in finite classes, following a standard definition of dimension introduced by Ben-David et al. (2019). For the question of "how", we prove a computational hardness result: we construct a reward function class for which at most two queries are needed to find the optimal action, yet no algorithm can do so in polynomial time unless RP=NP. We also prove that this class admits efficient algorithms for standard algorithmic operations often considered in learning theory, such as an ERM. This implies that computational hardness is in this case inherent to the task of bandit learning. Beyond these results, we investigate additional themes such as learning under noise, trade-offs between noise models, and the relationship between query complexity and regret minimization.

<title>Agile Orchestration at Will: An Entire Smart Service-Based Security Architecture Towards 6G</title>

Abstract: The upcoming 6G will fundamentally reshape mobile networks beyond communications, unlocking a multitude of applications that were once considered unimaginable. Meanwhile, security and resilience are especially highlighted in the 6G design principles. However, safeguarding 6G networks will be quite challenging due to various known and unknown threats from highly heterogeneous networks and diversified security requirements of distinct use cases, calling for a comprehensive re-design of security architecture. This motivates us to propose ES3A (Entire Smart Service-based Security Architecture), a novel security architecture for 6G networks. Specifically, we first discuss six high-level principles of our ES3A that include hierarchy, flexibility, scalability, resilience, endogeny, and trust and privacy. With these goals in mind, we then introduce three guidelines from a deployment perspective, envisioning our ES3A that offers service-based security, end-to-end protection, and smart security automation for 6G networks. Our architecture consists of three layers and three domains. It relies on a two-stage orchestration mechanism to tailor smart security strategies for customized protection in high-dynamic 6G networks, thereby addressing the aforementioned challenges. Finally, we prototype the proposed ES3A on a real-world radio system based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR). Experiments show the effectiveness of our ES3A. We also provide a case to show the superiority of our architecture.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have transformed visual content creation, producing highly realistic images from natural language prompts. However, concerns persist around their potential to replicate and magnify existing societal biases. To investigate these issues, we curated a diverse set of prompts spanning thematic categories such as occupations, traits, actions, ideologies, emotions, family roles, place descriptions, spirituality, and life events. For each of the 160 unique topics, we crafted multiple prompt variations to reflect a wide range of meanings and perspectives. Using Stable Diffusion 1.5 (UNet-based) and Flux-1 (DiT-based) models with original checkpoints, we generated over 16,000 images under consistent settings. Additionally, we collected 8,000 comparison images from Google Image Search. All outputs were filtered to exclude abstract, distorted, or nonsensical results. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in the representation of gender, race, age, somatotype, and other human-centric factors across generated images. These disparities often mirror and reinforce harmful stereotypes embedded in societal narratives. We discuss the implications of these findings and emphasize the need for more inclusive datasets and development practices to foster fairness in generative visual systems.

Abstract: How does the threat of infectious disease influence sociality among generative agents? We used generative agent-based modeling (GABM), powered by large language models, to experimentally test hypotheses about the behavioral immune system. Across three simulation runs, generative agents who read news about an infectious disease outbreak showed significantly reduced social engagement compared to agents who received no such news, including lower attendance at a social gathering, fewer visits to third places (e.g., cafe, store, park), and fewer conversations throughout the town. In interview responses, agents explicitly attributed their behavioral changes to disease-avoidance motivations. A validity check further indicated that they could distinguish between infectious and noninfectious diseases, selectively reducing social engagement only when there was a risk of infection. Our findings highlight the potential of GABM as an experimental tool for exploring complex human social dynamics at scale.

Abstract: While online advertising is highly dependent on implicit interaction networks of anonymous users for engagement inference, and for the selection and optimization of delivery strategies, existing graph models seldom can capture the multi-scale temporal, semantic and higher-order dependency features of these interaction networks, thus it's hard to describe the complicated patterns of the anonymous behavior. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Temporal-Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (DTH-GNN), which achieves three main contributions. Above all, we introduce temporal edge decomposition, which divides each interaction into three types of channels: short-term burst, diurnal cycle and long-range memory, and conducts feature extraction using the convolution kernel of parallel dilated residuals; Furthermore, our model builds a hierarchical heterogeneous aggregation, where user-user, user-advertisement, advertisement-advertisement subgraphs are combined through the meta-path conditional Transformer encoder, where the noise structure is dynamically tamped down via the synergy of cross-channel self-attention and gating relationship selector. Thirdly, the contrast regularity of feedback perception is formulated, the consistency of various time slices is maximized, the entropy of control exposure information with dual-view target is maximized, the global prototype of dual-momentum queue distillation is presented, and the strategy gradient layer with light weight is combined with delaying transformation signal to fine-tune the node representation for benefit-oriented. The AUC of DTH-GNN improved by 8.2% and the logarithmic loss improved by 5.7% in comparison with the best baseline model.

Abstract: We introduce ICE-ID, a novel benchmark dataset for historical identity resolution, comprising 220 years (1703-1920) of Icelandic census records. ICE-ID spans multiple generations of longitudinal data, capturing name variations, demographic changes, and rich genealogical links. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, open tabular dataset specifically designed to study long-term person-entity matching in a real-world population. We define identity resolution tasks (within and across census waves) with clearly documented metrics and splits. We evaluate a range of methods: handcrafted rule-based matchers, a ML ensemble as well as LLMs for structured data (e.g. transformer-based tabular networks) against a novel approach to tabular data called NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System) - a general-purpose AI framework designed to reason with limited knowledge and resources. Its core is Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL), a term-based logic. Our experiments show that NARS is suprisingly simple and competitive with other standard approaches, achieving SOTA at our task. By releasing ICE-ID and our code, we enable reproducible benchmarking of identity resolution approaches in longitudinal settings and hope that ICE-ID opens new avenues for cross-disciplinary research in data linkage and historical analytics.

<title>Causality in the human niche: lessons for machine learning</title>

arXiv:2506.13803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans interpret the world around them in terms of cause and effect and communicate their understanding of the world to each other in causal terms. These causal aspects of human cognition are thought to underlie humans' ability to generalize and learn efficiently in new domains, an area where current machine learning systems are weak. Building human-like causal competency into machine learning systems may facilitate the construction of effective and interpretable AI. Indeed, the machine learning community has been importing ideas on causality formalized by the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework, which provides a rigorous formal language for many aspects of causality and has led to significant advances. However, the SCM framework fails to capture some salient aspects of human causal cognition and has likewise not yet led to advances in machine learning in certain critical areas where humans excel. We contend that the problem of causality in the ``human niche'' -- for a social, autonomous, and goal-driven agent sensing and acting in the world in which humans live -- is quite different from the kind of causality captured by SCMs. For example, everyday objects come in similar types that have similar causal properties, and so humans readily generalize knowledge of one type of object (cups) to another related type (bowls) by drawing causal analogies between objects with similar properties, but such analogies are at best awkward to express in SCMs. We explore how such causal capabilities are adaptive in, and motivated by, the human niche. By better appreciating properties of human causal cognition and, crucially, how those properties are adaptive in the niche in which humans live, we hope that future work at the intersection of machine learning and causality will leverage more human-like inductive biases to create more capable, controllable, and interpretable systems.

Abstract: Graphics rendering applications increasingly leverage neural networks in tasks such as denoising, supersampling, and frame extrapolation to improve image quality while maintaining frame rates. The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks.

Abstract: Generative AI foundation models offer transformative potential for processing structured biological data, particularly in single-cell RNA sequencing, where datasets are rapidly scaling toward billions of cells. We propose the use of agentic foundation models with real-time web search to automate the labeling of experimental data, achieving up to 82.5% accuracy. This addresses a key bottleneck in supervised learning for structured omics data by increasing annotation throughput without manual curation and human error. Our approach enables the development of virtual cell foundation models capable of downstream tasks such as cell-typing and perturbation prediction. As data volume grows, these models may surpass human performance in labeling, paving the way for reliable inference in large-scale perturbation screens. This application demonstrates domain-specific innovation in health monitoring and diagnostics, aligned with efforts like the Human Cell Atlas and Human Tumor Atlas Network.

The proliferation of AI agents and the adoption of synthetic data create a synthetic mirror that conceptualizes a representation and potential distortion of reality, thus generating trust and accountability deficits. This paper explores the implications for privacy and policymaking stemming from synthetic data generation, and the urgent need for new policy instruments and legal framework adaptation to ensure appropriate levels of trust and accountability for AI agents relying on synthetic data. Rather than creating entirely new policy or legal regimes, the most practical approach involves targeted amendments to existing frameworks, recognizing synthetic data as a distinct regulatory category with unique characteristics.

Abstract: In this study, we present a dual-modal AI framework based on short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy. The first modality employs a multi-wavelength SWIR imaging system coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture spatial features linked to glucose absorption. The second modality uses a compact photodiode voltage sensor and machine learning regressors (e.g., random forest) on normalized optical signals. Both approaches were evaluated on synthetic blood phantoms and skin-mimicking materials across physiological glucose levels (70 to 200 mg/dL). The CNN achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.82% at 650 nm with 100% Zone A coverage in the Clarke Error Grid, while the photodiode system reached 86.4% Zone A accuracy. This framework constitutes a state-of-the-art solution that balances clinical accuracy, cost efficiency, and wearable integration, paving the way for reliable continuous non-invasive glucose monitoring.

Abstract: Silent speech decoding, which performs unvocalized human speech recognition from electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG), increases accessibility for speech-impaired humans. However, data collection is difficult and performed using varying experimental setups, making it nontrivial to collect a large, homogeneous dataset. In this study we introduce neural networks that can handle EEG/EMG with heterogeneous electrode placements and show strong performance in silent speech decoding via multi-task training on large-scale EEG/EMG datasets. We achieve improved word classification accuracy in both healthy participants (95.3%), and a speech-impaired patient (54.5%), substantially outperforming models trained on single-subject data (70.1% and 13.2%). Moreover, our models also show gains in cross-language calibration performance. This increase in accuracy suggests the feasibility of developing practical silent speech decoding systems, particularly for speech-impaired patients.

Abstract: An effective reward model plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning for post-training enhancement of visual generative models. However, current approaches of reward modeling suffer from implementation complexity due to their reliance on extensive human-annotated preference data or meticulously engineered quality dimensions that are often incomplete and engineering-intensive. Inspired by adversarial training in generative adversarial networks (GANs), this paper proposes GAN-RM, an efficient reward modeling framework that eliminates manual preference annotation and explicit quality dimension engineering. Our method trains the reward model through discrimination between a small set of representative, unpaired target samples(denoted as Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated ordinary outputs, requiring only a few hundred target samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our GAN-RM's effectiveness across multiple key applications including test-time scaling implemented as Best-of-N sample filtering, post-training approaches like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.

Abstract: Cooperative game theory has become a cornerstone of post-hoc interpretability in machine learning, largely through the use of Shapley values. Yet, despite their widespread adoption, Shapley-based methods often rest on axiomatic justifications whose relevance to feature attribution remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit cooperative game theory from an interpretability perspective and argue for a broader and more principled use of its tools. We highlight two general families of efficient allocations, the Weber and Harsanyi sets, that extend beyond Shapley values and offer richer interpretative flexibility. We present an accessible overview of these allocation schemes, clarify the distinction between value functions and aggregation rules, and introduce a three-step blueprint for constructing reliable and theoretically-grounded feature attributions. Our goal is to move beyond fixed axioms and provide the XAI community with a coherent framework to design attribution methods that are both meaningful and robust to shifting methodological trends.

<title>A Systematic Review of User-Centred Evaluation of Explainable AI in Healthcare</title>

Abstract: Despite promising developments in Explainable Artificial Intelligence, the practical value of XAI methods remains under-explored and insufficiently validated in real-world settings. Robust and context-aware evaluation is essential, not only to produce understandable explanations but also to ensure their trustworthiness and usability for intended users, but tends to be overlooked because of no clear guidelines on how to design an evaluation with users.
  This study addresses this gap with two main goals: (1) to develop a framework of well-defined, atomic properties that characterise the user experience of XAI in healthcare; and (2) to provide clear, context-sensitive guidelines for defining evaluation strategies based on system characteristics.
  We conducted a systematic review of 82 user studies, sourced from five databases, all situated within healthcare settings and focused on evaluating AI-generated explanations. The analysis was guided by a predefined coding scheme informed by an existing evaluation framework, complemented by inductive codes developed iteratively.
  The review yields three key contributions: (1) a synthesis of current evaluation practices, highlighting a growing focus on human-centred approaches in healthcare XAI; (2) insights into the interrelations among explanation properties; and (3) an updated framework and a set of actionable guidelines to support interdisciplinary teams in designing and implementing effective evaluation strategies for XAI systems tailored to specific application contexts.

<title>Density-aware Walks for Coordinated Campaign Detection</title>

Abstract: Coordinated campaigns frequently exploit social media platforms by artificially amplifying topics, making inauthentic trends appear organic, and misleading users into engagement. Distinguishing these coordinated efforts from genuine public discourse remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of such attacks. Our work focuses on detecting coordinated campaigns by modeling the problem as a graph classification task. We leverage the recently introduced Large Engagement Networks (LEN) dataset, which contains over 300 networks capturing engagement patterns from both fake and authentic trends on Twitter prior to the 2023 Turkish elections. The graphs in LEN were constructed by collecting interactions related to campaigns that stemmed from ephemeral astroturfing. Established graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to accurately classify campaign graphs, highlighting the challenges posed by LEN due to the large size of its networks. To address this, we introduce a new graph classification method that leverages the density of local network structures. We propose a random weighted walk (RWW) approach in which node transitions are biased by local density measures such as degree, core number, or truss number. These RWWs are encoded using the Skip-gram model, producing density-aware structural embeddings for the nodes. Training message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) on these density-aware embeddings yields superior results compared to the simpler node features available in the dataset, with nearly a 12\% and 5\% improvement in accuracy for binary and multiclass classification, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating density-aware structural encoding with MPNNs provides a robust framework for identifying coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media networks such as Twitter.

Abstract: Most existing literature on supervised machine learning assumes that the training dataset is drawn from an i.i.d. sample. However, many real-world problems exhibit temporal dependence and strong correlations between the marginal distributions of the data-generating process, suggesting that the i.i.d. assumption is often unrealistic. In such cases, models naturally include time-series processes with mixing properties, as well as irreducible and aperiodic ergodic Markov chains. Moreover, the learning rates typically obtained in these settings are independent of the data distribution, which can lead to restrictive choices of hypothesis classes and suboptimal sample complexities for the learning algorithm. In this article, we consider the case where the training dataset is generated by an iterated random function (i.e., an iteratively defined time-homogeneous Markov chain) that is not necessarily irreducible or aperiodic. Under the assumption that the governing function is contractive with respect to its first argument and subject to certain regularity conditions on the hypothesis class, we first establish a uniform convergence result for the corresponding sample error. We then demonstrate the learnability of the approximate empirical risk minimization algorithm and derive its learning rate bound. Both rates are data-distribution dependent, expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the underlying hypothesis class, allowing them to more accurately reflect the properties of the data-generating distribution.

Abstract: We address the regression problem under the constraint of demographic parity, a commonly used fairness definition. Recent studies have revealed fair minimax optimal regression algorithms, the most accurate algorithms that adhere to the fairness constraint. However, these analyses are tightly coupled with specific data generation models. In this paper, we provide meta-theorems that can be applied to various situations to validate the fair minimax optimality of the corresponding regression algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fair minimax optimal regression can be achieved through post-processing methods, allowing researchers and practitioners to focus on improving conventional regression techniques, which can then be efficiently adapted for fair regression.

<title>A Hybrid Neural Network -- Polynomial Series Scheme for Learning Invariant Manifolds of Discrete Dynamical Systems</title>

Abstract: We propose a hybrid machine learning scheme to learn -- in physics-informed and numerical analysis-informed fashion -- invariant manifolds (IM) of discrete maps for constructing reduced-order models (ROMs) for dynamical systems. The proposed scheme combines polynomial series with shallow neural networks, exploiting the complementary strengths of both approaches. Polynomials enable an efficient and accurate modeling of ROMs with guaranteed local exponential convergence rate around the fixed point, where, under certain assumptions, the IM is demonstrated to be analytic. Neural networks provide approximations to more complex structures beyond the reach of the polynomials' convergence. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme using three benchmark examples, examining convergence behavior, numerical approximation accuracy, and computational training cost. Additionally, we compare the IM approximations obtained solely with neural networks and with polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid scheme outperforms both pure polynomial approximations (power series, Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials) and standalone shallow neural network approximations in terms of numerical approximation accuracy.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a critical task across domains such as cybersecurity and healthcare. In the unsupervised setting, an effective and theoretically-grounded principle is to train classifiers to distinguish normal data from (synthetic) anomalies. We extend this principle to semi-supervised AD, where training data also include a limited labeled subset of anomalies possibly present in test time. We propose a theoretically-grounded and empirically effective framework for semi-supervised AD that combines known and synthetic anomalies during training. To analyze semi-supervised AD, we introduce the first mathematical formulation of semi-supervised AD, which generalizes unsupervised AD. Here, we show that synthetic anomalies enable (i) better anomaly modeling in low-density regions and (ii) optimal convergence guarantees for neural network classifiers -- the first theoretical result for semi-supervised AD. We empirically validate our framework on five diverse benchmarks, observing consistent performance gains. These improvements also extend beyond our theoretical framework to other classification-based AD methods, validating the generalizability of the synthetic anomaly principle in AD.

Abstract: Storm surge is one of the deadliest hazards posed by tropical cyclones (TCs), yet assessing its current and future risk is difficult due to the phenomenon's rarity and physical complexity. Recent advances in artificial intelligence applications to natural hazard modeling suggest a new avenue for addressing this problem. We utilize a deep learning storm surge model to efficiently estimate coastal surge risk in the United States from 900,000 synthetic TC events, accounting for projected changes in TC behavior and sea levels. The derived historical 100-year surge (the event with a 1% yearly exceedance probability) agrees well with historical observations and other modeling techniques. When coupled with an inundation model, we find that heightened TC intensities and sea levels by the end of the century result in a 50% increase in population at risk. Key findings include markedly heightened risk in Florida, and critical thresholds identified in Georgia and South Carolina.

Abstract: Mammographic breast density classification is essential for cancer risk assessment but remains challenging due to subjective interpretation and inter-observer variability. This study compares multimodal and CNN-based methods for automated classification using the BI-RADS system, evaluating BioMedCLIP and ConvNeXt across three learning scenarios: zero-shot classification, linear probing with textual descriptions, and fine-tuning with numerical labels. Results show that zero-shot classification achieved modest performance, while the fine-tuned ConvNeXt model outperformed the BioMedCLIP linear probe. Although linear probing demonstrated potential with pretrained embeddings, it was less effective than full fine-tuning. These findings suggest that despite the promise of multimodal learning, CNN-based models with end-to-end fine-tuning provide stronger performance for specialized medical imaging. The study underscores the need for more detailed textual representations and domain-specific adaptations in future radiology applications.

Abstract: Group conversations over videoconferencing are a complex social behavior. However, the subjective moments of negative experience, where the conversation loses fluidity or enjoyment remain understudied. These moments are infrequent in naturalistic data, and thus training a supervised learning (SL) model requires costly manual data annotation. We applied semi-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage targeted labeled and unlabeled clips for training multimodal (audio, facial, text) deep features to predict non-fluid or unenjoyable moments in holdout videoconference sessions. The modality-fused co-training SSL achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.9 and an F1 score of 0.6, outperforming SL models by up to 4% with the same amount of labeled data. Remarkably, the best SSL model with just 8% labeled data matched 96% of the SL model's full-data performance. This shows an annotation-efficient framework for modeling videoconference experience.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a wide class Mirror Descent (MD) algorithms, which play a key role in machine learning. For this purpose we formulated the constrained optimization problem, in which we exploits the Bregman divergence with the Tempesta multi-parametric deformation logarithm as a link function. This link function called also mirror function defines the mapping between the primal and dual spaces and is associated with a very-wide (in fact, theoretically infinite) class of generalized trace-form entropies. In order to derive novel MD updates, we estimate generalized exponential function, which closely approximates the inverse of the multi-parametric Tempesta generalized logarithm. The shape and properties of the Tempesta logarithm and its inverse-deformed exponential functions can be tuned by several hyperparameters. By learning these hyperparameters, we can adapt to distribution or geometry of training data, and we can adjust them to achieve desired properties of MD algorithms. The concept of applying multi-parametric logarithms allow us to generate a new wide and flexible family of MD and mirror-less MD updates.

Abstract: Money laundering enables organized crime by allowing illicit funds to enter the legitimate economy. Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, only a small fraction is ever uncovered. This stems from a range of factors, including deliberate evasion by launderers, the rarity of confirmed cases, and the limited visibility each financial institution has into the global transaction network. While several synthetic datasets are available, they fail to model the structural and behavioral complexity of real-world money laundering. In particular, they often overlook partial observability, sparse and uncertain labels, strategic behavior, temporal dynamics, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. To address these limitations, we present AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. It enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering (AML) systems in a controlled environment that captures key real-world challenges. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to rigorously evaluate methods under conditions that reflect the complexity of practical AML scenarios.

Abstract: Effective management of agricultural landscapes is critical for meeting global biodiversity targets, but efforts are hampered by the absence of detailed, large-scale ecological maps. To address this, we introduce Farmscapes, the first large-scale (covering most of England), high-resolution (25cm) map of rural landscape features, including ecologically vital elements like hedgerows, woodlands, and stone walls. This map was generated using a deep learning segmentation model trained on a novel, dataset of 942 manually annotated tiles derived from aerial imagery. Our model accurately identifies key habitats, achieving high f1-scores for woodland (96\%) and farmed land (95\%), and demonstrates strong capability in segmenting linear features, with an F1-score of 72\% for hedgerows. By releasing the England-wide map on Google Earth Engine, we provide a powerful, open-access tool for ecologists and policymakers. This work enables data-driven planning for habitat restoration, supports the monitoring of initiatives like the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and lays the foundation for advanced analysis of landscape connectivity.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for chemical learning based on Competitive Dimerization Networks (CDNs) - systems in which multiple molecular species, e.g. proteins or DNA/RNA oligomers, reversibly bind to form dimers. We show that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution, enabling the implementation of complex learning tasks such as multiclass classification without digital hardware or explicit parameter tuning. Each molecular species functions analogously to a neuron, with binding affinities acting as tunable synaptic weights. A training protocol involving mutation, selection, and amplification of DNA-based components allows CDNs to robustly discriminate among noisy input patterns. The resulting classifiers exhibit strong output contrast and high mutual information between input and output, especially when guided by a contrast-enhancing loss function. Comparative analysis with in silico gradient descent training reveals closely correlated performance. These results establish CDNs as a promising platform for analog physical computation, bridging synthetic biology and machine learning, and advancing the development of adaptive, energy-efficient molecular computing systems.

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting is crucial for public health, disaster preparedness, and agriculture, and yet it remains a particularly challenging timescale to predict. We explore the use of an interpretable AI-informed model analog forecasting approach, previously employed on longer timescales, to improve S2S predictions. Using an artificial neural network, we learn a mask of weights to optimize analog selection and showcase its versatility across three varied prediction tasks: 1) classification of Week 3-4 Southern California summer temperatures; 2) regional regression of Month 1 midwestern U.S. summer temperatures; and 3) classification of Month 1-2 North Atlantic wintertime upper atmospheric winds. The AI-informed analogs outperform traditional analog forecasting approaches, as well as climatology and persistence baselines, for deterministic and probabilistic skill metrics on both climate model and reanalysis data. We find the analog ensembles built using the AI-informed approach also produce better predictions of temperature extremes and improve representation of forecast uncertainty. Finally, by using an interpretable-AI framework, we analyze the learned masks of weights to better understand S2S sources of predictability.

Abstract: Sketches have shown high accuracy in multi-way join cardinality estimation, a critical problem in cost-based query optimization. Accurately estimating the cardinality of a join operation -- analogous to its computational cost -- allows the optimization of query execution costs in relational database systems. However, although sketches have shown high efficacy in query optimization, they are typically constructed specifically for predefined selections in queries that are assumed to be given a priori, hindering their applicability to new queries. As a more general solution, we propose for Sum-Product Networks to dynamically approximate sketches on-the-fly. Sum-Product Networks can decompose and model multivariate distributions, such as relations, as linear combinations of multiple univariate distributions. By representing these univariate distributions as sketches, Sum-Product Networks can combine them element-wise to efficiently approximate the sketch of any query selection. These approximate sketches can then be applied to join cardinality estimation. In particular, we implement the Fast-AGMS and Bound Sketch methods, which have successfully been used in prior work, despite their costly construction. By accurately approximating them instead, our work provides a practical alternative to apply these sketches to query optimization.

Abstract: Causal effect estimation seeks to determine the impact of an intervention from observational data. However, the existing causal inference literature primarily addresses treatment effects on frequently occurring events. But what if we are interested in estimating the effects of a policy intervention whose benefits, while potentially important, can only be observed and measured in rare yet impactful events, such as extreme climate events? The standard causal inference methodology is not designed for this type of inference since the events of interest may be scarce in the observed data and some degree of extrapolation is necessary. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) provides methodologies for analyzing statistical phenomena in such extreme regimes. We introduce a novel framework for assessing treatment effects in extreme data to capture the causal effect at the occurrence of rare events of interest. In particular, we employ the theory of multivariate regular variation to model extremities. We develop a consistent estimator for extreme treatment effects and present a rigorous non-asymptotic analysis of its performance. We illustrate the performance of our estimator using both synthetic and semi-synthetic data.

Abstract: The universal learning framework has been developed to obtain guarantees on the learning rates that hold for any fixed distribution, which can be much faster than the ones uniformly hold over all the distributions. Given that the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) principle being fundamental in the PAC theory and ubiquitous in practical machine learning, the recent work of arXiv:2412.02810 studied the universal rates of ERM for binary classification under the realizable setting. However, the assumption of realizability is too restrictive to hold in practice. Indeed, the majority of the literature on universal learning has focused on the realizable case, leaving the non-realizable case barely explored.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of universal learning by ERM for binary classification under the agnostic setting, where the ''learning curve" reflects the decay of the excess risk as the sample size increases. We explore the possibilities of agnostic universal rates and reveal a compact trichotomy: there are three possible agnostic universal rates of ERM, being either $e^{-n}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We provide a complete characterization of which concept classes fall into each of these categories. Moreover, we also establish complete characterizations for the target-dependent universal rates as well as the Bayes-dependent universal rates.

Abstract: Data plays the most prominent role in how language models acquire skills and knowledge. The lack of massive, well-organized pre-training datasets results in costly and inaccessible data pipelines. We present Essential-Web v1.0, a 24-trillion-token dataset in which every document is annotated with a twelve-category taxonomy covering topic, format, content complexity, and quality. Taxonomy labels are produced by EAI-Distill-0.5b, a fine-tuned 0.5b-parameter model that achieves an annotator agreement within 3% of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. With nothing more than SQL-style filters, we obtain competitive web-curated datasets in math (-8.0% relative to SOTA), web code (+14.3%), STEM (+24.5%) and medical (+8.6%). Essential-Web v1.0 is available on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/datasets/EssentialAI/essential-web-v1.0

Abstract: Tokenization is used almost universally by modern language models, enabling efficient text representation using multi-byte or multi-character tokens. However, prior work has shown that tokenization can introduce distortion into the model's generations. For example, users are often advised not to end their prompts with a space because it prevents the model from including the space as part of the next token. This Prompt Boundary Problem (PBP) also arises in languages such as Chinese and in code generation, where tokens often do not line up with syntactic boundaries. Additionally mismatching tokenizers often hinder model composition and interoperability. For example, it is not possible to directly ensemble models with different tokenizers due to their mismatching vocabularies. To address these issues, we present an inference-time method to convert any autoregressive LM with a BPE tokenizer into a character-level or byte-level LM, without changing its generative distribution at the text level. Our method efficient solves the PBP and is also able to unify the vocabularies of language models with different tokenizers, allowing one to ensemble LMs with different tokenizers at inference time as well as transfer the post-training from one model to another using proxy-tuning. We demonstrate in experiments that the ensemble and proxy-tuned models outperform their constituents on downstream evals.

<title>Hard Contacts with Soft Gradients: Refining Differentiable Simulators for Learning and Control</title>

Abstract: Contact forces pose a major challenge for gradient-based optimization of robot dynamics as they introduce jumps in the system's velocities. Penalty-based simulators, such as MuJoCo, simplify gradient computation by softening the contact forces. However, realistically simulating hard contacts requires very stiff contact settings, which leads to incorrect gradients when using automatic differentiation. On the other hand, using non-stiff settings strongly increases the sim-to-real gap. We analyze the contact computation of penalty-based simulators to identify the causes of gradient errors. Then, we propose DiffMJX, which combines adaptive integration with MuJoCo XLA, to notably improve gradient quality in the presence of hard contacts. Finally, we address a key limitation of contact gradients: they vanish when objects do not touch. To overcome this, we introduce Contacts From Distance (CFD), a mechanism that enables the simulator to generate informative contact gradients even before objects are in contact. To preserve physical realism, we apply CFD only in the backward pass using a straight-through trick, allowing us to compute useful gradients without modifying the forward simulation.

Abstract: Action-labeled data for robotics is scarce and expensive, limiting the generalization of learned policies. In contrast, vast amounts of action-free video data are readily available, but translating these observations into effective policies remains a challenge. We introduce AMPLIFY, a novel framework that leverages large-scale video data by encoding visual dynamics into compact, discrete motion tokens derived from keypoint trajectories. Our modular approach separates visual motion prediction from action inference, decoupling the challenges of learning what motion defines a task from how robots can perform it. We train a forward dynamics model on abundant action-free videos and an inverse dynamics model on a limited set of action-labeled examples, allowing for independent scaling. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the learned dynamics are both accurate, achieving up to 3.7x better MSE and over 2.5x better pixel prediction accuracy compared to prior approaches, and broadly useful. In downstream policy learning, our dynamics predictions enable a 1.2-2.2x improvement in low-data regimes, a 1.4x average improvement by learning from action-free human videos, and the first generalization to LIBERO tasks from zero in-distribution action data. Beyond robotic control, we find the dynamics learned by AMPLIFY to be a versatile latent world model, enhancing video prediction quality. Our results present a novel paradigm leveraging heterogeneous data sources to build efficient, generalizable world models. More information can be found at https://amplify-robotics.github.io/.

Abstract: We propose a test for abstract causal reasoning in AI, based on scholarship in the philosophy of causation, in particular on the neuron diagrams popularized by D. Lewis. We illustrate the test on advanced Large Language Models (ChatGPT, DeepSeek and Gemini). Remarkably, these chatbots are already capable of correctly identifying causes in cases that are hotly debated in the literature. In order to assess the results of these LLMs and future dedicated AI, we propose a definition of cause in neuron diagrams with a wider validity than published hitherto, which challenges the widespread view that such a definition is elusive. We submit that these results are an illustration of how future philosophical research might evolve: as an interplay between human and artificial expertise.

Abstract: Computational astrochemical models are essential for helping us interpret and understand the observations of different astrophysical environments. In the age of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the substructure of many objects can be resolved, raising the need for astrochemical modeling at these smaller scales, meaning that the simulations of these objects need to include both the physics and chemistry to accurately model the observations. The computational cost of the simulations coupling both the three-dimensional hydrodynamics and chemistry is enormous, creating an opportunity for surrogate models that can effectively substitute the chemical solver. In this work we present surrogate models that can replace the original chemical code, namely Latent Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We train these surrogate architectures on three datasets of increasing physical complexity, with the last dataset derived directly from a three-dimensional simulation of a molecular cloud using a Photodissociation Region (PDR) code, 3D-PDR. We show that these surrogate models can provide speedup and reproduce the original observable column density maps of the dataset. This enables the rapid inference of the chemistry (on the GPU), allowing for the faster statistical inference of observations or increasing the resolution in hydrodynamical simulations of astrophysical environments.

<title>Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater: How and why deep learning for ARC</title>

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) presents a formidable challenge for AI systems. Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the deep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating skillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and tasks in vision, language etc. The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able to train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in these diverse domains. Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage this paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time. We demonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel abstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC. Specifically, we treat both the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained network) as integral components of the inference process, fostering generalization to unseen tasks. Concretely, we propose a methodology for training on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC reasoning. We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment Inference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time techniques. We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used effectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a further 300% boost with TTFT. An early version of this approach secured first place in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the current best score on the ARC private test-set (58%). Our findings highlight the key ingredients of a robust reasoning system in unfamiliar domains, underscoring the central mechanisms that improve broad perceptual reasoning.

Abstract: Imitation learning has driven the development of generalist policies capable of autonomously solving multiple tasks. However, when a pretrained policy makes errors during deployment, there are limited mechanisms for users to correct its behavior. While collecting additional data for finetuning can address such issues, doing so for each downstream use case is inefficient at deployment. My research proposes an alternative: keeping pretrained policies frozen as a fixed skill repertoire while allowing user interactions to guide behavior generation toward user preferences at inference time. By making pretrained policies steerable, users can help correct policy errors when the model struggles to generalize-without needing to finetune the policy. Specifically, I propose (1) inference-time steering, which leverages user interactions to switch between discrete skills, and (2) task and motion imitation, which enables user interactions to edit continuous motions while satisfying task constraints defined by discrete symbolic plans. These frameworks correct misaligned policy predictions without requiring additional training, maximizing the utility of pretrained models while achieving inference-time user objectives.

Abstract: We present Sleeping-DISCO 9M, a large-scale pre-training dataset for music and song. To the best of our knowledge, there are no open-source high-quality dataset representing popular and well-known songs for generative music modeling tasks such as text-music, music-captioning, singing-voice synthesis, melody reconstruction and cross-model retrieval. Past contributions focused on isolated and constrained factors whose core perspective was to create synthetic or re-recorded music corpus (e.g. GTSinger, M4Singer) and arbitrarily large-scale audio datasets (e.g. DISCO-10M and LAIONDISCO-12M) had been another focus for the community. Unfortunately, adoption of these datasets has been below substantial in the generative music community as these datasets fail to reflect real-world music and its flavour. Our dataset changes this narrative and provides a dataset that is constructed using actual popular music and world-renowned artists.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for refining a given correspondence map between two shapes. A correspondence map represented as a functional map, namely a change of basis matrix, can be additionally treated as a 2D image. With this perspective, we train an image diffusion model directly in the space of functional maps, enabling it to generate accurate maps conditioned on an inaccurate initial map. The training is done purely in the functional space, and thus is highly efficient. At inference time, we use the pointwise map corresponding to the current functional map as guidance during the diffusion process. The guidance can additionally encourage different functional map objectives, such as orthogonality and commutativity with the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We show that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods of map refinement and that guided diffusion models provide a promising pathway to functional map processing.

Abstract: There is growing interest in extending average treatment effect (ATE) estimation to incorporate non-tabular data, such as images and text, which may act as sources of confounding. Neglecting these effects risks biased results and flawed scientific conclusions. However, incorporating non-tabular data necessitates sophisticated feature extractors, often in combination with ideas of transfer learning. In this work, we investigate how latent features from pre-trained neural networks can be leveraged to adjust for sources of confounding. We formalize conditions under which these latent features enable valid adjustment and statistical inference in ATE estimation, demonstrating results along the example of double machine learning. We discuss critical challenges inherent to latent feature learning and downstream parameter estimation arising from the high dimensionality and non-identifiability of representations. Common structural assumptions for obtaining fast convergence rates with additive or sparse linear models are shown to be unrealistic for latent features. We argue, however, that neural networks are largely insensitive to these issues. In particular, we show that neural networks can achieve fast convergence rates by adapting to intrinsic notions of sparsity and dimension of the learning problem.

Abstract: Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, exhibit strong performance on complex tasks through test-time inference scaling. However, prior studies have shown that these models often incur significant computational costs due to excessive reasoning, such as frequent switching between reasoning trajectories (e.g., underthinking) or redundant reasoning on simple questions (e.g., overthinking). In this work, we expose a novel threat: adversarial inputs can be crafted to exploit excessive reasoning behaviors and substantially increase computational overhead without compromising model utility. Therefore, we propose a novel loss framework consisting of three components: (1) Priority Cross-Entropy Loss, a modification of the standard cross-entropy objective that emphasizes key tokens by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LMs; (2) Excessive Reasoning Loss, which encourages the model to initiate additional reasoning paths during inference; and (3) Delayed Termination Loss, which is designed to extend the reasoning process and defer the generation of final outputs. We optimize and evaluate our attack for the GSM8K and ORCA datasets on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen. Empirical results demonstrate a 3x to 9x increase in reasoning length with comparable utility performance. Furthermore, our crafted adversarial inputs exhibit transferability, inducing computational overhead in o3-mini, o1-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and QWQ models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining their internal, parametric knowledge with external, non-parametric sources, with the goal of improving factual correctness and minimizing hallucinations. The LiveRAG 2025 challenge explores RAG solutions to maximize accuracy on DataMorgana's QA pairs, which are composed of single-hop and multi-hop questions. The challenge provides access to sparse OpenSearch and dense Pinecone indices of the Fineweb 10BT dataset. It restricts model use to LLMs with up to 10B parameters and final answer generation with Falcon-3-10B. A judge-LLM assesses the submitted answers along with human evaluators. By exploring distinct retriever combinations and RAG solutions under the challenge conditions, our final solution emerged using InstructRAG in combination with a Pinecone retriever and a BGE reranker. Our solution achieved a correctness score of 1.13 and a faithfulness score of 0.55, placing fourth in the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

Abstract: Large multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) effectively scale the model size to boost performance while maintaining fixed active parameters. However, previous works primarily utilized full-precision experts during sparse up-cycling. Despite they show superior performance on end tasks, the large amount of experts introduces higher memory footprint, which poses significant challenges for the deployment on edge devices. In this work, we propose MoTE, a scalable and memory-efficient approach to train Mixture-of-Ternary-Experts models from dense checkpoint. Instead of training fewer high-precision experts, we propose to train more low-precision experts during up-cycling. Specifically, we use the pre-trained FFN as a shared expert and train ternary routed experts with parameters in {-1, 0, 1}. Extensive experiments show that our approach has promising scaling trend along model size. MoTE achieves comparable performance to full-precision baseline MoE-LLaVA while offering lower memory footprint. Furthermore, our approach is compatible with post-training quantization methods and the advantage further amplifies when memory-constraint goes lower. Given the same amount of expert memory footprint of 3.4GB and combined with post-training quantization, MoTE outperforms MoE-LLaVA by a gain of 4.3% average accuracy on end tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for memory-constrained devices.

Abstract: Model compression is critical for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. We introduce a novel method enhancing knowledge distillation with integrated gradients (IG) as a data augmentation strategy. Our approach overlays IG maps onto input images during training, providing student models with deeper insights into teacher models' decision-making processes. Extensive evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that our IG-augmented knowledge distillation achieves 92.6% testing accuracy with a 4.1x compression factor-a significant 1.1 percentage point improvement ($p<0.001$) over non-distilled models (91.5%). This compression reduces inference time from 140 ms to 13 ms. Our method precomputes IG maps before training, transforming substantial runtime costs into a one-time preprocessing step. Our comprehensive experiments include: (1) comparisons with attention transfer, revealing complementary benefits when combined with our approach; (2) Monte Carlo simulations confirming statistical robustness; (3) systematic evaluation of compression factor versus accuracy trade-offs across a wide range (2.2x-1122x); and (4) validation on an ImageNet subset aligned with CIFAR-10 classes, demonstrating generalisability beyond the initial dataset. These extensive ablation studies confirm that IG-based knowledge distillation consistently outperforms conventional approaches across varied architectures and compression ratios. Our results establish this framework as a viable compression technique for real-world deployment on edge devices while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) can be implemented very efficiently in neuromorphic systems. Nevertheless, training of these models with powerful gradient-based learning algorithms is mostly performed on standard digital hardware using Backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT has substantial limitations. It does not permit online training and its memory consumption scales linearly with the number of computation steps. In contrast, learning methods using forward propagation of gradients operate in an online manner with a memory consumption independent of the number of time steps. These methods enable SNNs to learn from continuous, infinite-length input sequences. Yet, slow execution speed on conventional hardware as well as inferior performance has hindered their widespread application. In this work, we introduce HYbrid PRopagation (HYPR) that combines the efficiency of parallelization with approximate online forward learning. Our algorithm yields high-throughput online learning through parallelization, paired with constant, i.e., sequence length independent, memory demands. HYPR enables parallelization of parameter update computation over the sub sequences for RSNNs consisting of almost arbitrary non-linear spiking neuron models. We apply HYPR to networks of spiking neurons with oscillatory subthreshold dynamics. We find that this type of neuron model is particularly well trainable by HYPR, resulting in an unprecedentedly low task performance gap between approximate forward gradient learning and BPTT.

Abstract: One-shot subset selection serves as an effective tool to reduce deep learning training costs by identifying an informative data subset based on the information extracted by an information extractor (IE). Traditional IEs, typically pre-trained on the target dataset, are inherently dataset-dependent. Foundation models (FMs) offer a promising alternative, potentially mitigating this limitation. This work investigates two key questions: (1) Can FM-based subset selection outperform traditional IE-based methods across diverse datasets? (2) Do all FMs perform equally well as IEs for subset selection? Extensive experiments uncovered surprising insights: FMs consistently outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets, whereas their advantage diminishes on coarse-grained datasets with noisy labels. Motivated by these finding, we propose RAM-APL (RAnking Mean-Accuracy of Pseudo-class Labels), a method tailored for fine-grained image datasets. RAM-APL leverages multiple FMs to enhance subset selection by exploiting their complementary strengths. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained datasets, including Oxford-IIIT Pet, Food-101, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011.

Abstract: In linear contextual bandits, the objective is to select actions that maximize cumulative rewards, modeled as a linear function with unknown parameters. Although Thompson Sampling performs well empirically, it does not achieve optimal regret bounds. This paper proposes a nearly minimax optimal Thompson Sampling for linear contextual bandits by developing a novel estimator with the adaptive augmentation and coupling of the hypothetical samples that are designed for efficient parameter learning. The proposed estimator accurately predicts rewards for all arms without relying on assumptions for the context distribution. Empirical results show robust performance and significant improvement over existing methods.

However, most approaches still struggle to balance pocket-specific geometric fit with strict valence and synthetic constraints. To resolve this trade-off, a Retrieval-Enhanced Aligned Diffusion termed READ is introduced, which is the first to merge molecular Retrieval-Augmented Generation with an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model. Specifically, a contrastively pre-trained encoder aligns atom-level representations during training, then retrieves graph embeddings of pocket-matched scaffolds to guide each reverse-diffusion step at inference. This single mechanism can inject real-world chemical priors exactly where needed, producing valid, diverse, and shape-complementary ligands. Experimental results demonstrate that READ can achieve very competitive performance in CBGBench, surpassing state-of-the-art generative models and even native ligands. That suggests retrieval and diffusion can be co-optimized for faster, more reliable structure-based drug design.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique for foundation models. Recent work has highlighted an inherent asymmetry in the initialization of LoRA's low-rank factors, which has been present since its inception and was presumably derived experimentally. This paper focuses on providing a comprehensive theoretical characterization of asymmetric LoRA with frozen random factors. First, while existing research provides upper-bound generalization guarantees based on averages over multiple experiments, the behaviour of a single fine-tuning run with specific random factors remains an open question. We address this by investigating the concentration of the typical LoRA generalization gap around its mean. Our main upper bound reveals a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{\sqrt{r}}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$ with high probability for rank $r$ LoRAs trained on $N$ samples. Additionally, we also determine the fundamental limits in terms of sample efficiency, establishing a matching lower bound of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$. By more closely reflecting the practical scenario of a single fine-tuning run, our findings offer crucial insights into the reliability and practicality of asymmetric LoRA.

<title>Risk Estimation of Knee Osteoarthritis Progression via Predictive Multi-task Modelling from Efficient Diffusion Model using X-ray Images</title>

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a crucial role in assessing knee osteoarthritis (OA) risk by enabling early detection and disease monitoring. Recent machine learning methods have improved risk estimation (i.e., predicting the likelihood of disease progression) and predictive modelling (i.e., the forecasting of future outcomes based on current data) using medical images, but clinical adoption remains limited due to their lack of interpretability. Existing approaches that generate future images for risk estimation are complex and impractical. Additionally, previous methods fail to localize anatomical knee landmarks, limiting interpretability. We address these gaps with a new interpretable machine learning method to estimate the risk of knee OA progression via multi-task predictive modelling that classifies future knee OA severity and predicts anatomical knee landmarks from efficiently generated high-quality future images. Such image generation is achieved by leveraging a diffusion model in a class-conditioned latent space to forecast disease progression, offering a visual representation of how particular health conditions may evolve. Applied to the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset, our approach improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 2\%, achieving an AUC of 0.71 in predicting knee OA progression while offering ~9% faster inference time.

Abstract: Weight decay is a standard regularization technique for training large language models (LLMs). While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify "heavy-tailedness." Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance. Extensive pre-training tasks with various model sizes from 60M to 1B demonstrate that AlphaDecay achieves better perplexity and generalization than conventional uniform decay and other adaptive decay baselines.

Abstract: Phase distortion refers to the alteration of the phase relationships between frequencies in a signal, which can be perceptible. In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We show the security risk associated with using machine learning classifiers in United States election tabulators. The central classification task in election tabulation is deciding whether a mark does or does not appear on a bubble associated to an alternative in a contest on the ballot. Barretto et al. (E-Vote-ID 2021) reported that convolutional neural networks are a viable option in this field, as they outperform simple feature-based classifiers.
  Our contributions to election security can be divided into four parts. To demonstrate and analyze the hypothetical vulnerability of machine learning models on election tabulators, we first introduce four new ballot datasets. Second, we train and test a variety of different models on our new datasets. These models include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (a basic CNN, VGG and ResNet), and vision transformers (Twins and CaiT). Third, using our new datasets and trained models, we demonstrate that traditional white box attacks are ineffective in the voting domain due to gradient masking. Our analyses further reveal that gradient masking is a product of numerical instability. We use a modified difference of logits ratio loss to overcome this issue (Croce and Hein, ICML 2020). Fourth, in the physical world, we conduct attacks with the adversarial examples generated using our new methods. In traditional adversarial machine learning, a high (50% or greater) attack success rate is ideal. However, for certain elections, even a 5% attack success rate can flip the outcome of a race. We show such an impact is possible in the physical domain. We thoroughly discuss attack realism, and the challenges and practicality associated with printing and scanning ballot adversarial examples.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative modeling approaches, but they require many sampling steps. Consistency models can distill these models into efficient one-step generators; however, unlike flow- and diffusion-based methods, their performance inevitably degrades when increasing the number of steps, which we show both analytically and empirically. Flow maps generalize these approaches by connecting any two noise levels in a single step and remain effective across all step counts. In this paper, we introduce two new continuous-time objectives for training flow maps, along with additional novel training techniques, generalizing existing consistency and flow matching objectives. We further demonstrate that autoguidance can improve performance, using a low-quality model for guidance during distillation, and an additional boost can be achieved by adversarial finetuning, with minimal loss in sample diversity. We extensively validate our flow map models, called Align Your Flow, on challenging image generation benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art few-step generation performance on both ImageNet 64x64 and 512x512, using small and efficient neural networks. Finally, we show text-to-image flow map models that outperform all existing non-adversarially trained few-step samplers in text-conditioned synthesis.

Abstract: This work addresses image restoration tasks through the lens of inverse problems using unpaired datasets. In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method with a proof of concept for lens calibration: a real-world application traditionally requiring time-consuming experiments and specialized equipment. In contrast, our approach achieves this with minimal data acquisition effort.

Abstract: The hardware ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with increasing interest in translating low-level programs across different instruction set architectures (ISAs) in a quick, flexible, and correct way to enhance the portability and longevity of existing code. A particularly challenging class of this transpilation problem is translating between complex- (CISC) and reduced- (RISC) hardware architectures, due to fundamental differences in instruction complexity, memory models, and execution paradigms. In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks. We will open-source our codes, data, models, and benchmarks to establish a common foundation for ISA-level code translation research.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an essential emergent ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and recent studies introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to exemplars of ICL to enhance the reasoning capability, especially in mathematics tasks. However, given the continuous advancement of model capabilities, it remains unclear whether CoT exemplars still benefit recent, stronger models in such tasks. Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations. We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}. Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance. Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.

Abstract: In AI research and practice, rigor remains largely understood in terms of methodological rigor -- such as whether mathematical, statistical, or computational methods are correctly applied. We argue that this narrow conception of rigor has contributed to the concerns raised by the responsible AI community, including overblown claims about AI capabilities. Our position is that a broader conception of what rigorous AI research and practice should entail is needed. We believe such a conception -- in addition to a more expansive understanding of (1) methodological rigor -- should include aspects related to (2) what background knowledge informs what to work on (epistemic rigor); (3) how disciplinary, community, or personal norms, standards, or beliefs influence the work (normative rigor); (4) how clearly articulated the theoretical constructs under use are (conceptual rigor); (5) what is reported and how (reporting rigor); and (6) how well-supported the inferences from existing evidence are (interpretative rigor). In doing so, we also aim to provide useful language and a framework for much-needed dialogue about the AI community's work by researchers, policymakers, journalists, and other stakeholders.

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.

In this work, we analyze its performance in the task of simultaneously estimating the mean of each function in a class $\mathcal{F}$ when the data distribution possesses only the first $p$ moments for $p \in (1,2]$. We prove a new sample complexity bound using a novel symmetrization technique that may be of independent interest. Additionally, we present applications of our result to $k$-means clustering with unbounded inputs and linear regression with general losses, improving upon existing works.

Abstract: One of the most profound challenges of modern machine learning is performing well on the long-tail of rare and underrepresented features. Large general-purpose models are trained for many tasks, but work best on high-frequency use cases. After training, it is hard to adapt a model to perform well on specific use cases underrepresented in the training corpus. Relying on prompt engineering or few-shot examples to maximize the output quality on a particular test case can be frustrating, as models can be highly sensitive to small changes, react in unpredicted ways or rely on a fixed system prompt for maintaining performance. In this work, we ask: "Can we optimize our training protocols to both improve controllability and performance on underrepresented use cases at inference time?" We revisit the divide between training and inference techniques to improve long-tail performance while providing users with a set of control levers the model is trained to be responsive to. We create a detailed taxonomy of data characteristics and task provenance to explicitly control generation attributes and implicitly condition generations at inference time. We fine-tune a base model to infer these markers automatically, which makes them optional at inference time. This principled and flexible approach yields pronounced improvements in performance, especially on examples from the long tail of the training distribution. While we observe an average lift of 5.7% win rates in open-ended generation quality with our markers, we see over 9.1% gains in underrepresented domains. We also observe relative lifts of up to 14.1% on underrepresented tasks like CodeRepair and absolute improvements of 35.3% on length instruction following evaluations.

Abstract: Diffusion models are well known for their ability to generate a high-fidelity image for an input prompt through an iterative denoising process. Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts. We empirically demonstrate on COCO and DiffusionDB that by learning to route to nine already-trained text-to-image models, our approach is able to deliver an average quality that is higher than that achievable by any of these models alone.

<title>Markov Regime-Switching Intelligent Driver Model for Interpretable Car-Following Behavior</title>

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable car-following models are essential for traffic simulation and autonomous vehicle development. However, classical models like the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) are fundamentally limited by their parsimonious and single-regime structure. They fail to capture the multi-modal nature of human driving, where a single driving state (e.g., speed, relative speed, and gap) can elicit many different driver actions. This forces the model to average across distinct behaviors, reducing its fidelity and making its parameters difficult to interpret. To overcome this, we introduce a regime-switching framework that allows driving behavior to be governed by different IDM parameter sets, each corresponding to an interpretable behavioral mode. This design enables the model to dynamically switch between interpretable behavioral modes, rather than averaging across diverse driving contexts. We instantiate the framework using a Factorial Hidden Markov Model with IDM dynamics (FHMM-IDM), which explicitly separates intrinsic driving regimes (e.g., aggressive acceleration, steady-state following) from external traffic scenarios (e.g., free-flow, congestion, stop-and-go) through two independent latent Markov processes. Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to jointly estimate the regime-specific parameters, transition dynamics, and latent state trajectories. Experiments on the HighD dataset demonstrate that FHMM-IDM uncovers interpretable structure in human driving, effectively disentangling internal driver actions from contextual traffic conditions and revealing dynamic regime-switching patterns. This framework provides a tractable and principled solution to modeling context-dependent driving behavior under uncertainty, offering improvements in the fidelity of traffic simulations, the efficacy of safety analyses, and the development of more human-centric ADAS.

Abstract: The success of large language models in text processing has inspired their adaptation to speech modeling. However, since speech is continuous and complex, it is often discretized for autoregressive modeling. Speech tokens derived from self-supervised models (known as semantic tokens) typically focus on the linguistic aspects of speech but neglect prosodic information. As a result, models trained on these tokens can generate speech with reduced naturalness. Existing approaches try to fix this by adding pitch features to the semantic tokens. However, pitch alone cannot fully represent the range of paralinguistic attributes, and selecting the right features requires careful hand-engineering. To overcome this, we propose an end-to-end variational approach that automatically learns to encode these continuous speech attributes to enhance the semantic tokens. Our approach eliminates the need for manual extraction and selection of paralinguistic features. Moreover, it produces preferred speech continuations according to human raters. Code, samples and models are available at https://github.com/b04901014/vae-gslm.

Abstract: The non-convexity of the artificial neural network (ANN) training landscape brings inherent optimization difficulties. While the traditional back-propagation stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and its variants are effective in certain cases, they can become stuck at spurious local minima and are sensitive to initializations and hyperparameters. Recent work has shown that the training of an ANN with ReLU activations can be reformulated as a convex program, bringing hope to globally optimizing interpretable ANNs. However, naively solving the convex training formulation has an exponential complexity, and even an approximation heuristic requires cubic time. In this work, we characterize the quality of this approximation and develop two efficient algorithms that train ANNs with global convergence guarantees. The first algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). It solves both the exact convex formulation and the approximate counterpart. Linear global convergence is achieved, and the initial several iterations often yield a solution with high prediction accuracy. When solving the approximate formulation, the per-iteration time complexity is quadratic. The second algorithm, based on the "sampled convex programs" theory, solves unconstrained convex formulations and converges to an approximately globally optimal classifier. The non-convexity of the ANN training landscape exacerbates when adversarial training is considered. We apply the robust convex optimization theory to convex training and develop convex formulations that train ANNs robust to adversarial inputs. Our analysis explicitly focuses on one-hidden-layer fully connected ANNs, but can extend to more sophisticated architectures.

Abstract: A primary requirement for any reinforcement learning method is that it should produce policies that improve upon the initial guess. In this work, we show that the widely used Deep Q-Network (DQN) fails to satisfy this minimal criterion -- even when it gets to see all possible states and actions infinitely often (a condition under which tabular Q-learning is guaranteed to converge to the optimal Q-value function). Our specific contributions are twofold. First, we numerically show that DQN often returns a policy that performs worse than the initial one. Second, we offer a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon in linear DQN, a simplified version of DQN that uses linear function approximation in place of neural networks while retaining the other key components such as $\epsilon$-greedy exploration, experience replay, and target network. Using tools from differential inclusion theory, we prove that the limit points of linear DQN correspond to fixed points of projected Bellman operators. Crucially, we show that these fixed points need not relate to optimal -- or even near-optimal -- policies, thus explaining linear DQN's sub-optimal behaviors. We also give a scenario where linear DQN always identifies the worst policy. Our work fills a longstanding gap in understanding the convergence behaviors of Q-learning with function approximation and $\epsilon$-greedy exploration.

Abstract: Mixed sample data augmentation strategies are actively used when training deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies suggest that they are effective at various tasks. However, the impact of mixed sample data augmentation on model interpretability has not been widely studied. In this paper, we explore the relationship between model interpretability and mixed sample data augmentation, specifically in terms of feature attribution maps. To this end, we introduce a new metric that allows a comparison of model interpretability while minimizing the impact of occlusion robustness of the model. Experimental results show that several mixed sample data augmentation decreases the interpretability of the model and label mixing during data augmentation plays a significant role in this effect. This new finding suggests it is important to carefully adopt the mixed sample data augmentation method, particularly in applications where attribution map-based interpretability is important.

Abstract: Constructing decision trees online is a classical machine learning problem. Existing works often assume that features are readily available for each incoming data point. However, in many real world applications, both feature values and the labels are unknown a priori and can only be obtained at a cost. For example, in medical diagnosis, doctors have to choose which tests to perform (i.e., making costly feature queries) on a patient in order to make a diagnosis decision (i.e., predicting labels). We provide a fresh perspective to tackle this practical challenge. Our framework consists of an active planning oracle embedded in an online learning scheme for which we investigate several information acquisition functions. Specifically, we employ a surrogate information acquisition function based on adaptive submodularity to actively query feature values with a minimal cost, while using a posterior sampling scheme to maintain a low regret for online prediction. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework via extensive experiments on various real-world datasets. Our framework also naturally adapts to the challenging setting of online learning with concept drift and is shown to be competitive with baseline models while being more flexible.

Abstract: The training of neural networks requires tedious and often manual tuning of the network architecture. We propose a systematic approach to inserting new layers during the training process. Our method eliminates the need to choose a fixed network size before training, is numerically inexpensive to execute and applicable to various architectures including fully connected feedforward networks, ResNets and CNNs. Our technique borrows ideas from constrained optimization and is based on first-order sensitivity information of the loss function with respect to the virtual parameters that additional layers, if inserted, would offer. In numerical experiments, our proposed sensitivity-based layer insertion technique (SensLI) exhibits improved performance on training loss and test error, compared to training on a fixed architecture, and reduced computational effort in comparison to training the extended architecture from the beginning. Our code is available on https://github.com/mathemml/SensLI.

Abstract: In games like chess, strategy evolves dramatically across distinct phases - the opening, middlegame, and endgame each demand different forms of reasoning and decision-making. Yet, many modern chess engines rely on a single neural network to play the entire game uniformly, often missing opportunities to specialize. In this work, we introduce M2CTS, a modular framework that combines Mixture of Experts with Monte Carlo Tree Search to adapt strategy dynamically based on game phase. We explore three different methods for training the neural networks: Separated Learning, Staged Learning, and Weighted Learning. By routing decisions through specialized neural networks trained for each phase, M2CTS improves both computational efficiency and playing strength. In experiments on chess, M2CTS achieves up to +122 Elo over standard single-model baselines and shows promising generalization to multi-agent domains such as Pommerman. These results highlight how modular, phase-aware systems can better align with the structured nature of games and move us closer to human-like behavior in dividing a problem into many smaller units.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration requires the ability to learn personalized concepts from a limited number of demonstrations, while exhibiting inductive generalization, hierarchical composition, and adaptability to novel constraints. Existing approaches that use code generation capabilities of pre-trained large (vision) language models as well as purely neural models show poor generalization to \emph{a-priori} unseen complex concepts. Neuro-symbolic methods (Grand et al., 2023) offer a promising alternative by searching in program space, but face challenges in large program spaces due to the inability to effectively guide the search using demonstrations. Our key insight is to factor inductive concept learning as: (i) {\it Sketch:} detecting and inferring a coarse signature of a new concept (ii) {\it Plan:} performing an MCTS search over grounded action sequences guided by human demonstrations (iii) {\it Generalize:} abstracting out grounded plans as inductive programs. Our pipeline facilitates generalization and modular re-use, enabling continual concept learning. Our approach combines the benefits of code generation ability of large language models (LLMs) along with grounded neural representations, resulting in neuro-symbolic programs that show stronger inductive generalization on the task of constructing complex structures vis-\'a-vis LLM-only and purely neural approaches. Further, we demonstrate reasoning and planning capabilities with learned concepts for embodied instruction following.

Abstract: Exploring noise distributions beyond Gaussian in diffusion models remains an open challenge. While Gaussian-based models succeed within a unified SDE framework, recent studies suggest that heavy-tailed noise distributions, like $\alpha$-stable distributions, may better handle mode collapse and effectively manage datasets exhibiting class imbalance, heavy tails, or prominent outliers. Recently, Yoon et al.\ (NeurIPS 2023), presented the L\'evy-It\^o model (LIM), directly extending the SDE-based framework to a class of heavy-tailed SDEs, where the injected noise followed an $\alpha$-stable distribution, a rich class of heavy-tailed distributions. However, the LIM framework relies on highly involved mathematical techniques with limited flexibility, potentially hindering broader adoption and further development. In this study, instead of starting from the SDE formulation, we extend the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) by replacing the Gaussian noise with $\alpha$-stable noise. By using only elementary proof techniques, the proposed approach, Denoising L\'evy Probabilistic Models (DLPM), boils down to vanilla DDPM with minor modifications. As opposed to the Gaussian case, DLPM and LIM yield different training algorithms and different backward processes, leading to distinct sampling algorithms. These fundamental differences translate favorably for DLPM as compared to LIM: our experiments show improvements in coverage of data distribution tails, better robustness to unbalanced datasets, and improved computation times requiring smaller number of backward steps.

Abstract: Recently, electromagnetic surrogate solvers, trained on solutions of Maxwell's equations under specific simulation conditions, enabled fast inference of computationally expensive simulations. However, conventional electromagnetic surrogate solvers often consider only a narrow range of spectrum and fail when encountering even slight variations in simulation conditions. To address this limitation, we define spectral consistency as the property by which the spatial frequency structure of wavelength-dependent condition embeddings matches that of the target electromagnetic field patterns. In addition, we propose two complementary components: a refined wave prior, which is the condition embedding that satisfies spectral consistency, and Wave-Informed element-wise Multiplicative Encoding (WIME), which integrates these embeddings throughout the model while preserving spectral consistency. This framework enables accurate field prediction across the broadband spectrum, including untrained intermediate wavelengths. Our approach reduces the normalized mean squared error at untrained wavelengths by up to 71% compared to the state-of-the-art electromagnetic surrogate solver and achieves a speedup of over 42 times relative to conventional numerical simulations.

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for perturbation response modeling in single cells, aimed at standardizing benchmarking in this rapidly evolving field. Our approach includes a modular and user-friendly model development and evaluation platform, a collection of diverse perturbational datasets, and a set of metrics designed to fairly compare models and dissect their performance nuances. Through extensive evaluation of both published and baseline models across diverse datasets, we highlight the limitations of widely used models, such as mode collapse. We also demonstrate the importance of rank metrics which complement traditional model fit measures, such as RMSE, for validating model effectiveness. Notably, our results show that while no single model architecture clearly outperforms others, simpler architectures are generally competitive and scale well with larger datasets. Overall, this benchmarking exercise sets new standards for model evaluation, supports robust model development, and advances the potential of these models to use high-throughput genetic and chemical screens for disease target discovery.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to solve the Schr\"odinger equation in configuration space. Traditional Configuration Interaction (CI) methods construct the wavefunction as a linear combination of Slater determinants, but this becomes computationally expensive due to the factorial growth in the number of configurations. Our approach extends the use of a generative model such as the RBM by incorporating a taboo list strategy to enhance efficiency and convergence. The RBM is used to efficiently identify and sample the most significant determinants, thus accelerating convergence and substantially reducing computational cost. This method achieves up to 99.99% of the correlation energy while using up to four orders of magnitude fewer determinants compared to full CI calculations and up to two orders of magnitude fewer than previous state of the art methods. Beyond efficiency, our analysis reveals that the RBM learns electron distributions over molecular orbitals by capturing quantum patterns that resemble Radial Distribution Functions (RDFs) linked to molecular bonding. This suggests that the learned pattern is interpretable, highlighting the potential of machine learning for explainable quantum chemistry

Abstract: Comparing datasets is a fundamental task in machine learning, essential for various learning paradigms-from evaluating train and test datasets for model generalization to using dataset similarity for detecting data drift. While traditional notions of dataset distances offer principled measures of similarity, their utility has largely been assessed through prediction error minimization. However, in Predict-then-Optimize (PtO) frameworks, where predictions serve as inputs for downstream optimization tasks, model performance is measured through decision regret rather than prediction error. In this work, we propose OTD$^3$ (Optimal Transport Decision-aware Dataset Distance), a novel dataset distance that incorporates downstream decisions in addition to features and labels. We show that traditional feature-label distances lack informativeness in PtO settings, while OTD$^3$ more effectively captures adaptation success. We also derive a PtO-specific adaptation bound based on this distance. Empirically, we show that our proposed distance accurately predicts model transferability across three different PtO tasks from the literature. The code is available at https://github.com/paularodr/OTD3.

Abstract: Designing biological sequences with desired properties is challenging due to vast search spaces and limited evaluation budgets. Although reinforcement learning methods use proxy models for rapid reward evaluation, insufficient training data can cause proxy misspecification on out-of-distribution inputs. To address this, we propose a novel off-policy search, $\delta$-Conservative Search, that enhances robustness by restricting policy exploration to reliable regions. Starting from high-score offline sequences, we inject noise by randomly masking tokens with probability $\delta$, then denoise them using our policy. We further adapt $\delta$ based on proxy uncertainty on each data point, aligning the level of conservativeness with model confidence. Experimental results show that our conservative search consistently enhances the off-policy training, outperforming existing machine learning methods in discovering high-score sequences across diverse tasks, including DNA, RNA, protein, and peptide design.

Abstract: Conventional notions of generalization often fail to describe the ability of learned models to capture meaningful information from dynamical data. A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.

Abstract: This document is a replication of the original "Rank-N-Contrast" (arXiv:2210.01189v2) paper published in 2023. This evaluation is done for academic purposes. Deep regression models often fail to capture the continuous nature of sample orders, creating fragmented representations and suboptimal performance. To address this, we reproduced the Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) framework, which learns continuous representations by contrasting samples by their rankings in the target space. Our study validates RNC's theoretical and empirical benefits, including improved performance and robustness. We extended the evaluation to an additional regression dataset and conducted robustness tests using a holdout method, where a specific range of continuous data was excluded from the training set. This approach assessed the model's ability to generalise to unseen data and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This replication study validates the original findings and broadens the understanding of RNC's applicability and robustness.

Abstract: Multi-label node classification is an important yet under-explored domain in graph mining as many real-world nodes belong to multiple categories rather than just a single one. Although a few efforts have been made by utilizing Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) to learn node representations and model correlations between multiple labels in the embedding space, they still suffer from the ambiguous feature and ambiguous topology induced by multiple labels, which reduces the credibility of the messages delivered in graphs and overlooks the label correlations on graph data. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce the ambiguity and empower the GCNs for accurate classification. However, this is quite challenging due to the requirement of retaining the distinctiveness of each label while fully harnessing the correlation between labels simultaneously. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Correlation-aware Graph Convolutional Network (CorGCN) for multi-label node classification. By introducing a novel Correlation-Aware Graph Decomposition module, CorGCN can learn a graph that contains rich label-correlated information for each label. It then employs a Correlation-Enhanced Graph Convolution to model the relationships between labels during message passing to further bolster the classification process. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CorGCN.

Abstract: Traditional fixed test sets fall short in evaluating open-ended capabilities of foundation models. To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended Benchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to generate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding to specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets, ONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by the original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most importantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting and aggregating sample-level tests.
  The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the aggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing models evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we explore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores. Our aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking with less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm provides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores. We also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing evaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We introduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language models, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present a technique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete, heterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmark alongside the rapidly developing foundation models.

Abstract: Accurate, actionable climate information at km scales is crucial for robust natural hazard risk assessment and infrastructure planning. Simulating climate at these resolutions remains intractable, forcing reliance on downscaling: either physics-based or statistical methods that transform climate simulations from coarse to impact-relevant resolutions. One major challenge for downscaling is to comprehensively capture the interdependency among climate processes of interest, a prerequisite for representing climate hazards. However, current approaches either lack the desired scalability or are bespoke to specific types of hazards. We introduce GenFocal, a computationally efficient, general-purpose, end-to-end generative framework that gives rise to full probabilistic characterizations of complex climate processes interacting at fine spatiotemporal scales. GenFocal more accurately assesses extreme risk in the current climate than leading approaches, including one used in the US 5th National Climate Assessment. It produces plausible tracks of tropical cyclones, providing accurate statistics of their genesis and evolution, even when they are absent from the corresponding climate simulations. GenFocal also shows compelling results that are consistent with the literature on projecting climate impact on decadal timescales. GenFocal revolutionizes how climate simulations can be efficiently augmented with observations and harnessed to enable future climate impact assessments at the spatiotemporal scales relevant to local and regional communities. We believe this work establishes genAI as an effective paradigm for modeling complex, high-dimensional multivariate statistical correlations that have deterred precise quantification of climate risks associated with hazards such as wildfires, extreme heat, tropical cyclones, and flooding; thereby enabling the evaluation of adaptation strategies.

Abstract: We introduce a method based on Conformal Prediction (CP) to quantify the uncertainty of full ranking algorithms. We focus on a specific scenario where $n+m$ items are to be ranked by some ``black box'' algorithm. It is assumed that the relative (ground truth) ranking of $n$ of them is known. The objective is then to quantify the error made by the algorithm on the ranks of the $m$ new items among the total $(n+m)$. In such a setting, the true ranks of the $n$ original items in the total $(n+m)$ depend on the (unknown) true ranks of the $m$ new ones. Consequently, we have no direct access to a calibration set to apply a classical CP method. To address this challenge, we propose to construct distribution-free bounds of the unknown conformity scores using recent results on the distribution of conformal p-values. Using these scores upper bounds, we provide valid prediction sets for the rank of any item. We also control the false coverage proportion, a crucial quantity when dealing with multiple prediction sets. Finally, we empirically show on both synthetic and real data the efficiency of our CP method for state-of-the-art algorithms such as RankNet or LambdaMart.

Abstract: Efficient sampling of unnormalized probability densities such as the Boltzmann distribution of molecular systems is a longstanding challenge. Next to conventional approaches like molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational approaches, such as training normalizing flows with the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, have been introduced. However, such methods are prone to mode collapse and often do not learn to sample the full configurational space. Here, we present temperature-annealed Boltzmann generators (TA-BG) to address this challenge. First, we demonstrate that training a normalizing flow with the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence at high temperatures is possible without mode collapse. Furthermore, we introduce a reweighting-based training objective to anneal the distribution to lower target temperatures. We apply this methodology to three molecular systems of increasing complexity and, compared to the baseline, achieve better results in almost all metrics while requiring up to three times fewer target energy evaluations. For the largest system, our approach is the only method that accurately resolves the metastable states of the system.

Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning (RL) assumes that an agent can observe a reward for each state-action pair. However, in practical applications, it is often difficult and costly to collect a reward for each state-action pair. While there have been several works considering RL with trajectory feedback, it is unclear if trajectory feedback is inefficient for learning when trajectories are long. In this work, we consider a model named RL with segment feedback, which offers a general paradigm filling the gap between per-state-action feedback and trajectory feedback. In this model, we consider an episodic Markov decision process (MDP), where each episode is divided into $m$ segments, and the agent observes reward feedback only at the end of each segment. Under this model, we study two popular feedback settings: binary feedback and sum feedback, where the agent observes a binary outcome and a reward sum according to the underlying reward function, respectively. To investigate the impact of the number of segments $m$ on learning performance, we design efficient algorithms and establish regret upper and lower bounds for both feedback settings. Our theoretical and experimental results show that: under binary feedback, increasing the number of segments $m$ decreases the regret at an exponential rate; in contrast, surprisingly, under sum feedback, increasing $m$ does not reduce the regret significantly.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed various manifestations of position bias in transformer architectures, from the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon to attention sinks, yet a comprehensive theoretical understanding of how attention masks and positional encodings shape these biases remains elusive. This paper presents a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing position bias in multi-layer attention. Modeling attention masks as directed graphs, we quantify how tokens interact with contextual information based on their sequential positions. We uncover two key insights: First, causal masking inherently biases attention toward earlier positions, as tokens in deeper layers attend to increasingly more contextualized representations of earlier tokens. Second, we characterize the competing effects of the causal mask and relative positional encodings, such as the decay mask and rotary positional encoding (RoPE): while both mechanisms introduce distance-based decay within individual attention maps, their aggregate effect across multiple attention layers$\unicode{x2013}$coupled with the causal mask$\unicode{x2013}$leads to a trade-off between the long-term decay effects and the cumulative importance of early sequence positions. Through controlled numerical experiments, we not only validate our theoretical findings but also reproduce position biases observed in real-world LLMs. Our framework offers a principled foundation for understanding positional biases in transformers, shedding light on the complex interplay of attention mechanism components and guiding more informed architectural design.

However, many real-world tasks, such as in smart cities and healthcare, require reasoning over complex events (CEs): (spatio)temporal, rule-governed patterns of short-term atomic events (AEs) that reflect high-level understanding and critical changes in the environment. These CEs are difficult to detect online: they are often rare, require long-range reasoning over noisy sensor data, must generalize rules beyond fixed-length traces, and suffer from limited real-world datasets due to the high annotation burden. We propose NAROCE, a Neural Algorithmic Reasoning framework for Online CE detection that separates the task into two stages: (i) learning CE rules from large-scale, low-cost pseudo AE concept traces generated by simulators or LLMs, and (ii) training an adapter to map real sensor data into the learned reasoning space using fewer labeled sensor samples. Experiments show that NAROCE outperforms the strongest baseline in accuracy, generalization to longer, unseen sequences, and data efficiency, achieving comparable performance with less than half the labeled data. These results suggest that decoupling CE rule learning from raw sensor inputs improves both data efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation.

Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) is a family of computational methods that derive near-optimal geometries from formal problem descriptions. Despite their success, established TO methods are limited to generating single solutions, restricting the exploration of alternative designs. To address this limitation, we introduce Topology Optimization using Modulated Neural Fields (TOM) - a data-free method that trains a neural network to generate structurally compliant shapes and explores diverse solutions through an explicit diversity constraint. The network is trained with a solver-in-the-loop, optimizing the material distribution in each iteration. The trained model produces diverse shapes that closely adhere to the design requirements. We validate TOM on 2D and 3D TO problems. Our results show that TOM generates more diverse solutions than any previous method, all while maintaining near-optimality and without relying on a dataset. These findings open new avenues for engineering and design, offering enhanced flexibility and innovation in structural optimization.

Abstract: We examine theoretical properties of the denoising score matching estimate. We model the density of observations with a nonparametric Gaussian mixture. We significantly relax the standard manifold assumption allowing the samples step away from the manifold. At the same time, we are still able to leverage a nice distribution structure. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on the approximation and generalization errors of the denoising score matching estimate. The rates of convergence are determined by the intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, our bounds remain valid even if we allow the ambient dimension grow polynomially with the sample size.

Abstract: The massive increase in the data volume and dataset availability for analysts compels researchers to focus on data content and select high-quality datasets to enhance the performance of analytics operators. While selecting high-quality data significantly boosts analytical accuracy and efficiency, the exact process is very challenging given large-scale dataset availability. To address this issue, we propose a novel methodology that infers the outcome of analytics operators by creating a model from the available datasets. Each dataset is transformed to a vector embedding representation generated by our proposed deep learning model NumTabData2Vec, where similarity search are employed. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the prediction performance and the execution time of our framework to another state-of-the-art modelling operator framework, illustrating that our approach predicts analytics outcomes accurately, and increases speedup. Furthermore, our vectorization model can project different real-world scenarios to a lower vector embedding representation accurately and distinguish them.

<title>SAE-V: Interpreting Multimodal Models for Enhanced Alignment</title>

Abstract: With the integration of image modality, the semantic space of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is more complex than text-only models, making their interpretability more challenging and their alignment less stable, particularly susceptible to low-quality data, which can lead to inconsistencies between modalities, hallucinations, and biased outputs. As a result, developing interpretability methods for MLLMs is crucial for improving alignment quality and efficiency. In text-only LLMs, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have gained attention for their ability to interpret latent representations. However, extending SAEs to multimodal settings presents new challenges due to modality fusion and the difficulty of isolating cross-modal representations. To address these challenges, we introduce SAE-V, a mechanistic interpretability framework that extends the SAE paradigm to MLLMs. By identifying and analyzing interpretable features along with their corresponding data, SAE-V enables fine-grained interpretation of both model behavior and data quality, facilitating a deeper understanding of cross-modal interactions and alignment dynamics. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal feature weighting, SAE-V provides an intrinsic data filtering mechanism to enhance model alignment without requiring additional models. Specifically, when applied to the alignment process of MLLMs, SAE-V-based data filtering methods could achieve more than 110% performance with less than 50% data. Our results highlight SAE-V's ability to enhance interpretability and alignment in MLLMs, providing insights into their internal mechanisms.

<title>Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to \emph{reward hacking}, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. Although reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests two key design principles: (1) the RL reward should be bounded, and (2) the RL reward benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B, and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate of at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training. The code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR, and the Work done during the internship at StepFun by Jiayi Fu.

Abstract: Previous successful approaches to missing modality completion rely on carefully designed fusion techniques and extensive pre-training on complete data, which can limit their generalizability in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. In this study, we pose a new challenge: can we develop a missing modality completion model that is both resource-efficient and robust to OOD generalization? To address this, we present a training-free framework for missing modality completion that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs). Our approach, termed the "Knowledge Bridger", is modality-agnostic and integrates generation and ranking of missing modalities. By defining domain-specific priors, our method automatically extracts structured information from available modalities to construct knowledge graphs. These extracted graphs connect the missing modality generation and ranking modules through the LMM, resulting in high-quality imputations of missing modalities. Experimental results across both general and medical domains show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods, including in OOD generalization. Additionally, our knowledge-driven generation and ranking techniques demonstrate superiority over variants that directly employ LMMs for generation and ranking, offering insights that may be valuable for applications in other domains.

Abstract: We present a challenging benchmark for the Open WorLd VISual question answering (OWLViz) task. OWLViz presents concise, unambiguous queries that require integrating multiple capabilities, including visual understanding, web exploration, and specialized tool usage. While humans achieve 69.2% accuracy on these intuitive tasks, even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle, with the best model, Gemini 2.0, achieving only 26.6% accuracy. Current agentic VLMs, which rely on limited vision and vision-language models as tools, perform even worse. This performance gap reveals significant limitations in multimodal systems' ability to select appropriate tools and execute complex reasoning sequences, establishing new directions for advancing practical AI research.

Abstract: We propose an unrolled algorithm approach for learning spatially adaptive parameter maps in the framework of convolutional synthesis-based $\ell_1$ regularization. More precisely, we consider a family of pre-trained convolutional filters and estimate deeply parametrized spatially varying parameters applied to the sparse feature maps by means of unrolling a FISTA algorithm to solve the underlying sparse estimation problem. The proposed approach is evaluated for image reconstruction of low-field MRI and compared to spatially adaptive and non-adaptive analysis-type procedures relying on Total Variation regularization and to a well-established model-based deep learning approach. We show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively comparable results with the latter approaches and at the same time remains highly interpretable. In particular, the inferred parameter maps quantify
  the local contribution of each filter in the reconstruction, which provides valuable insight into the algorithm mechanism and could potentially be used to discard unsuited filters.

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating valid and small prediction sets by sampling outputs (e.g., software code and natural language text) from a black-box deep generative model for a given input (e.g., textual prompt). The validity of a prediction set is determined by a user-defined binary admissibility function depending on the target application. For example, requiring at least one program in the set to pass all test cases in code generation application. To address this problem, we develop a simple and effective conformal inference algorithm referred to as Generative Prediction Sets (GPS). Given a set of calibration examples and black-box access to a deep generative model, GPS can generate prediction sets with provable guarantees. The key insight behind GPS is to exploit the inherent structure within the distribution over the minimum number of samples needed to obtain an admissible output to develop a simple conformal regression approach over the minimum number of samples. Experiments on multiple datasets for code and math word problems using different large language models demonstrate the efficacy of GPS over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: As modern neural networks get more complex, specifying a model with high predictive performance and sound uncertainty quantification becomes a more challenging task. Despite some promising theoretical results on the true posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian neural networks, the properties of even the most commonly used posterior approximations are often questioned. Computational burdens and intractable posteriors expose miscalibrated Bayesian neural networks to poor accuracy and unreliable uncertainty estimates. Approximate Bayesian inference aims to replace unknown and intractable posterior distributions with some simpler but feasible distributions. The dimensions of modern deep models, coupled with the lack of identifiability, make Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tremendously expensive and unable to fully explore the multimodal posterior. On the other hand, variational inference benefits from improved computational complexity but lacks the asymptotical guarantees of sampling-based inference and tends to concentrate around a single mode. The performance of both approaches heavily depends on architectural choices; this paper aims to shed some light on this by considering the computational costs, accuracy and uncertainty quantification in different scenarios including large width and out-of-sample data. To improve posterior exploration, different model averaging and ensembling techniques are studied, along with their benefits on predictive performance. In our experiments, variational inference overall provided better uncertainty quantification than MCMC; further, stacking and ensembles of variational approximations provided comparable accuracy to MCMC at a much-reduced cost.

Abstract: Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics system identification is crucial for circuit emulation. Traditional continuous-time domain modeling approaches have limitations in fitting capability and computational efficiency when used for modeling circuit IPs and device behaviors.This paper presents a novel continuous-time domain hybrid modeling paradigm. It integrates neural network differential models with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), creating NODE-RNN and NCDE-RNN models based on neural ordinary differential equations (NODE) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDE), respectively.Theoretical analysis shows that this hybrid model has mathematical advantages in event-driven dynamic mutation response and gradient propagation stability. Validation using real data from PIN diodes in high-power microwave environments shows NCDE-RNN improves fitting accuracy by 33\% over traditional NCDE, and NODE-RNN by 24\% over CTRNN, especially in capturing nonlinear memory effects.The model has been successfully deployed in Verilog-A and validated through circuit emulation, confirming its compatibility with existing platforms and practical value.This hybrid dynamics paradigm, by restructuring the neural differential equation solution path, offers new ideas for high-precision circuit time-domain modeling and is significant for complex nonlinear circuit system modeling.

Abstract: We evaluate the effectiveness of importance weighting in deep neural networks under label shift and covariate shift. On synthetic 2D data (linearly separable and moon-shaped) using logistic regression and MLPs, we observe that weighting strongly affects decision boundaries early in training but fades with prolonged optimization. On CIFAR-10 with various class imbalances, only L2 regularization (not dropout) helps preserve weighting effects. In a covariate-shift experiment, importance weighting yields no significant performance gain, highlighting challenges on complex data. Our results call into question the practical utility of importance weighting for real-world distribution shifts.

Abstract: Binary quantization approaches, which replace weight matrices with binary matrices and substitute costly multiplications with cheaper additions, offer a computationally efficient approach to address the increasing computational and storage requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the severe quantization constraint ($\pm1$) can lead to significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Double Binary Factorization (DBF), a novel method that factorizes dense weight matrices into products of two binary (sign) matrices, each accompanied by scaling vectors. DBF preserves the efficiency advantages of binary representations while achieving compression rates that are competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in a 1-bit per weight range, DBF is better than existing binarization approaches. In a 2-bit per weight range, DBF is competitive with the best quantization methods like QuIP\# and QTIP. Unlike most existing compression techniques, which offer limited compression level choices, DBF allows fine-grained control over compression ratios by adjusting the factorization's intermediate dimension. Based on this advantage, we further introduce an algorithm for estimating non-uniform layer-wise compression ratios for DBF, based on previously developed channel pruning criteria.

Abstract: Understanding pain-related facial behaviors is essential for digital healthcare in terms of effective monitoring, assisted diagnostics, and treatment planning, particularly for patients unable to communicate verbally. Existing data-driven methods of detecting pain from facial expressions are limited due to interpretability and severity quantification. To this end, we propose GraphAU-Pain, leveraging a graph-based framework to model facial Action Units (AUs) and their interrelationships for pain intensity estimation. AUs are represented as graph nodes, with co-occurrence relationships as edges, enabling a more expressive depiction of pain-related facial behaviors. By utilizing a relational graph neural network, our framework offers improved interpretability and significant performance gains. Experiments conducted on the publicly available UNBC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the GraphAU-Pain, achieving an F1-score of 66.21% and accuracy of 87.61% in pain intensity estimation.

Abstract: Collaborative training methods like Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) enable distributed machine learning without sharing raw data. However, FL assumes clients can train entire models, which is infeasible for large-scale models. In contrast, while SL alleviates the client memory constraint in FL by offloading most training to the server, it increases network latency due to its sequential nature. Other methods address the conundrum by using local loss functions for parallel client-side training to improve efficiency, but they lack server feedback and potentially suffer poor accuracy. We propose FSL-SAGE (Federated Split Learning via Smashed Activation Gradient Estimation), a new federated split learning algorithm that estimates server-side gradient feedback via auxiliary models. These auxiliary models periodically adapt to emulate server behavior on local datasets. We show that FSL-SAGE achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of communication rounds. This result matches FedAvg, while significantly reducing communication costs and client memory requirements. Our empirical results also verify that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art FSL methods, offering both communication efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach, group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$ algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 20.7% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.

Abstract: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) faces significant challenges posed by label noise, especially in multiclass classification tasks. Existing methods either lack mechanisms to handle label noise effectively or suffer from high computational costs due to redundant data usage. Inspired by granular computing, this paper proposes granular adaptive boosting (GAdaBoost), a novel two-stage framework comprising a data granulation stage and an adaptive boosting stage, to enhance efficiency and robustness under noisy conditions. To validate its feasibility, an extension of SAMME, termed GAdaBoost.SA, is proposed. Specifically, first, a granular-ball generation method is designed to compress data while preserving diversity and mitigating label noise. Second, the granular ball-based SAMME algorithm focuses on granular balls rather than individual samples, improving efficiency and reducing sensitivity to noise. Experimental results on some noisy datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior robustness and efficiency compared with existing methods, demonstrating that this work effectively extends AdaBoost and SAMME.

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells' morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However, the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models, demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant reductions in computation time.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality. This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally, we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further, while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit downstream model generalization.

Abstract: Consensus clustering, a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, aims to aggregate multiple input clusterings of a dataset, potentially based on different non-sensitive attributes, into a single clustering that best represents the collective structure of the data. In this work, we study this fundamental problem through the lens of fair clustering, as introduced by Chierichetti et al. [NeurIPS'17], which incorporates the disparate impact doctrine to ensure proportional representation of each protected group in the dataset within every cluster. Our objective is to find a consensus clustering that is not only representative but also fair with respect to specific protected attributes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address this problem and provide a constant-factor approximation.
  As part of our investigation, we examine how to minimally modify an existing clustering to enforce fairness -- an essential postprocessing step in many clustering applications that require fair representation. We develop an optimal algorithm for datasets with equal group representation and near-linear time constant factor approximation algorithms for more general scenarios with different proportions of two group sizes. We complement our approximation result by showing that the problem is NP-hard for two unequal-sized groups. Given the fundamental nature of this problem, we believe our results on Closest Fair Clustering could have broader implications for other clustering problems, particularly those for which no prior approximation guarantees exist for their fair variants.

Abstract: Recent innovations in multimodal action models represent a promising direction for developing general-purpose agentic systems, combining visual understanding, language comprehension, and action generation. We introduce MultiNet - a novel, fully open-source benchmark and surrounding software ecosystem designed to rigorously evaluate and adapt models across vision, language, and action domains. We establish standardized evaluation protocols for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), and provide open source software to download relevant data, models, and evaluations. Additionally, we provide a composite dataset with over 1.3 trillion tokens of image captioning, visual question answering, commonsense reasoning, robotic control, digital game-play, simulated locomotion/manipulation, and many more tasks. The MultiNet benchmark, framework, toolkit, and evaluation harness have been used in downstream research on the limitations of VLA generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via self-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs. While sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs, they often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work, we first propose dual-state linear attention (DSLA), a novel design that maintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving historical context and one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the short-range bias typical of linear-attention architectures. To further balance efficiency and accuracy under dynamic workload conditions, we introduce DSLA-Serve, an online adaptive distillation framework that progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference time, guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering. DSLA-Serve uses a chained fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly converted DSLA layer remains consistent with previously replaced layers, preserving the overall quality. Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning, long-context QA, and text summarization demonstrate that DSLA-Serve yields 2.3x faster inference than Llama2-7B and 3.0x faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies show that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies, addressing the historical-token underrepresentation seen in prior linear attentions. Codes are available at https://github.com/utnslab/DSLA-Serve.

Abstract: We construct multiperiodic processes -- a simple example of stationary ergodic stochastic processes over natural numbers that enjoy the vanishing entropy rate under a mild condition. Multiperiodic processes are supported on randomly shifted deterministic sequences called multiperiodic sequences, which can be efficiently generated using an algorithm called the Infinite Clock. Under a suitable parameterization, multiperiodic sequences exhibit relative frequencies of particular numbers given by Zipf's law. Exactly in the same setting, the respective multiperiodic processes satisfy an asymptotic power-law growth of block entropy, called Hilberg's law. Hilberg's law is deemed to hold for statistical language models, in particular.

Abstract: The most effective domain adaptation (DA) technique involves the decomposition of data representation into a domain-independent representation (DIRep) and a domain-dependent representation (DDRep). A classifier is trained by using the DIRep on the labeled source images. Since the DIRep is domain invariant, the classifier can be "transferred" to make predictions for the target domain with no (or few) labels. However, information useful for classification in the target domain can "hide" in the DDRep. Current DA algorithms, such as Domain-Separation Networks (DSN), do not adequately address this issue. DSN's weak constraint to enforce the orthogonality of DIRep and DDRep allows this hiding effect and can result in poor performance. To address this shortcoming, we develop a new algorithm wherein a stronger constraint is imposed to minimize the information content in DDRep to create a DIRep that retains relevant information about the target labels and, in turn, results in a better invariant representation. By using synthetic datasets, we show explicitly that depending on the initialization, DSN, with its weaker constraint, can lead to sub-optimal solutions with poorer DA performance. In contrast, our algorithm is robust against such perturbations. We demonstrate the equal-or-better performance of our approach against DSN and other recent DA methods by using several standard benchmark image datasets. We further highlight the compatibility of our algorithm with pre-trained models for classifying real-world images and showcase its adaptability and versatility through its application in network intrusion detection.

Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient alternative to generalized random forests (GRFs) for estimating heterogeneous effects in large dimensions. While GRFs rely on a gradient-based splitting criterion, which in large dimensions is computationally expensive and unstable, our method introduces a fixed-point approximation that eliminates the need for Jacobian estimation. This gradient-free approach preserves GRF's theoretical guarantees of consistency and asymptotic normality while significantly improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate that our method achieves a speedup of multiple times over standard GRFs without compromising statistical accuracy. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data validate our approach. Our findings suggest that the proposed method is a scalable alternative for localized effect estimation in machine learning and causal inference applications

Abstract: Captions are crucial for understanding scientific visualizations and documents. Existing captioning methods for scientific figures rely on figure-caption pairs extracted from documents for training, many of which fall short with respect to metrics like helpfulness, explainability, and visual-descriptiveness [15] leading to generated captions being misaligned with reader preferences. To enable the generation of high-quality figure captions, we introduce FigCaps-HF a new framework for figure-caption generation that can incorporate domain expert feedback in generating captions optimized for reader preferences. Our framework comprises of 1) an automatic method for evaluating quality of figure-caption pairs, 2) a novel reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) method to optimize a generative figure-to-caption model for reader preferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our simple learning framework by improving performance over standard fine-tuning across different types of models. In particular, when using BLIP as the base model, our RLHF framework achieves a mean gain of 35.7%, 16.9%, and 9% in ROUGE, BLEU, and Meteor, respectively. Finally, we release a large-scale benchmark dataset with human feedback on figure-caption pairs to enable further evaluation and development of RLHF techniques for this problem.

Abstract: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) faces increasing environmental scrutiny, particularly concerning the energy consumption of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and broader Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. However, existing systematic literature reviews of DLT rely on limited analyses of citations, abstracts, and keywords, failing to fully capture the field's complexity and ESG concerns. We address these challenges by analyzing the full text of 24,539 publications using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with our manually labeled Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset of 39,427 entities for DLT. This methodology identified 505 key publications at the DLT/ESG intersection, enabling comprehensive domain analysis. Our combined NLP and temporal graph analysis reveals critical trends in DLT evolution and ESG impacts, including cryptography and peer-to-peer networks research's foundational influence, Bitcoin's persistent impact on research and environmental concerns (a "Lindy effect"), Ethereum's catalytic role on Proof of Stake (PoS) and smart contract adoption, and the industry's progressive shift toward energy-efficient consensus mechanisms. Our contributions include the first DLT-specific NER dataset addressing the scarcity of high-quality labeled NLP data in blockchain research, a methodology integrating NLP and temporal graph analysis for large-scale interdisciplinary literature reviews, and the first NLP-driven literature review focusing on DLT's ESG aspects.

<title>Strategic Client Selection to Address Non-IIDness in HAPS-enabled FL Networks</title>

Abstract: The deployment of federated learning (FL) in non-terrestrial networks (NTN) that are supported by high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) offers numerous advantages. Due to its large footprint, it facilitates interaction with a large number of line-of-sight (LoS) ground clients, each possessing diverse datasets along with distinct communication and computational capabilities. The presence of many clients enhances the accuracy of the FL model and speeds up convergence. However, the variety of datasets among these clients poses a significant challenge, as it leads to pervasive non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. The data non-IIDness results in markedly reduced training accuracy and slower convergence rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel weighted attribute-based client selection strategy that leverages multiple user-specific attributes, including historical traffic patterns, instantaneous channel conditions, computational capabilities, and previous-round learning performance. By combining these attributes into a composite score for each user at every FL round and selecting users with higher scores as FL clients, the framework ensures more uniform and representative data distributions, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of non-IID data. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed client selection strategy in enhancing FL model accuracy and convergence rate, as well as reducing training loss, by effectively addressing the critical challenge of data non-IIDness in large-scale FL system implementations.

Abstract: We provide the first known algorithm that provably achieves $\varepsilon$-optimality within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon)$ function evaluations for the discounted discrete-time LQR problem with unknown parameters, without relying on two-point gradient estimates. These estimates are known to be unrealistic in many settings, as they depend on using the exact same initialization, which is to be selected randomly, for two different policies. Our results substantially improve upon the existing literature outside the realm of two-point gradient estimates, which either leads to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ rates or heavily relies on stability assumptions.

Abstract: Despite being a key bottleneck in many machine learning tasks, the cost of solving large linear systems has proven challenging to quantify due to problem-dependent quantities such as condition numbers. To tackle this, we consider a fine-grained notion of complexity for solving linear systems, which is motivated by applications where the data exhibits low-dimensional structure, including spiked covariance models and kernel machines, and when the linear system is explicitly regularized, such as ridge regression. Concretely, let $\kappa_\ell$ be the ratio between the $\ell$th largest and the smallest singular value of $n\times n$ matrix $A$. We give a stochastic algorithm based on the Sketch-and-Project paradigm, that solves the linear system $Ax = b$, that is, finds $\bar{x}$ such that $\|A\bar{x} - b\| \le \epsilon \|b\|$, in time $\bar O(\kappa_\ell\cdot n^2\log 1/\epsilon)$, for any $\ell = O(n^{0.729})$. This is a direct improvement over preconditioned conjugate gradient, and it provides a stronger separation between stochastic linear solvers and algorithms accessing $A$ only through matrix-vector products. Our main technical contribution is the new analysis of the first and second moments of the random projection matrix that arises in Sketch-and-Project.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters and utilize posterior samples for Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) in prediction. However, despite the crucial role of flatness in the loss landscape in improving the generalization of neural networks, its impact on BMA has been largely overlooked. In this work, we explore how posterior flatness influences BMA generalization and empirically demonstrate that (1) most approximate Bayesian inference methods fail to yield a flat posterior and (2) BMA predictions, without considering posterior flatness, are less effective at improving generalization. To address this, we propose Flat Posterior-aware Bayesian Model Averaging (FP-BMA), a novel training objective that explicitly encourages flat posteriors in a principled Bayesian manner. We also introduce a Flat Posterior-aware Bayesian Transfer Learning scheme that enhances generalization in downstream tasks. Empirically, we show that FP-BMA successfully captures flat posteriors, improving generalization performance.

Abstract: Alpha factor mining aims to discover investment signals from the historical financial market data, which can be used to predict asset returns and gain excess profits. Powerful deep learning methods for alpha factor mining lack interpretability, making them unacceptable in the risk-sensitive real markets. Formulaic alpha factors are preferred for their interpretability, while the search space is complex and powerful explorative methods are urged. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. REINFORCE employs Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the policy gradient-yielding unbiased but high variance estimates. The minimal environmental variability inherent in the underlying state transition function, which adheres to the Dirac distribution, can help alleviate this high variance issue, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Evaluations on real assets data indicate the proposed algorithm boosts correlation with returns by 3.83\%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well.

Abstract: Most music generation models directly generate a single music mixture. To allow for more flexible and controllable generation, the Multi-Source Diffusion Model (MSDM) has been proposed to model music as a mixture of multiple instrumental sources (e.g. piano, drums, bass, and guitar). Its goal is to use one single diffusion model to generate mutually-coherent music sources, that are then mixed to form the music. Despite its capabilities, MSDM is unable to generate music with rich melodies and often generates empty sounds. Its waveform diffusion approach also introduces significant Gaussian noise artifacts that compromise audio quality. In response, we introduce a Multi-Source Latent Diffusion Model (MSLDM) that employs Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode each instrumental source into a distinct latent representation. By training a VAE on all music sources, we efficiently capture each source's unique characteristics in a "source latent." The source latents are concatenated and our diffusion model learns this joint latent space. This approach significantly enhances the total and partial generation of music by leveraging the VAE's latent compression and noise-robustness. The compressed source latent also facilitates more efficient generation. Subjective listening tests and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) scores confirm that our model outperforms MSDM, showcasing its practical and enhanced applicability in music generation systems. We also emphasize that modeling sources is more effective than direct music mixture modeling. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/XZWY/MSLDM. Demos are available at https://xzwy.github.io/MSLDMDemo/.

Abstract: Recent advances (Sherman, 2017; Sidford and Tian, 2018; Cohen et al., 2021) have overcome the fundamental barrier of dimension dependence in the iteration complexity of solving $\ell_\infty$ regression with first-order methods. Yet it remains unclear to what extent such acceleration can be achieved for general $\ell_p$ smooth functions. In this paper, we propose a new accelerated first-order method for convex optimization under non-Euclidean smoothness assumptions. In contrast to standard acceleration techniques, our approach uses primal-dual iterate sequences taken with respect to $\textit{differing}$ norms, which are then coupled using an $\textit{implicitly}$ determined interpolation parameter. For $\ell_p$ norm smooth problems in $d$ dimensions, our method provides an iteration complexity improvement of up to $O(d^{1-\frac{2}{p}})$ in terms of calls to a first-order oracle, thereby allowing us to circumvent long-standing barriers in accelerated non-Euclidean steepest descent.

Abstract: By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.

Abstract: Cells in multicellular organisms coordinate to form functional and structural niches. With spatial transcriptomics enabling gene expression profiling in spatial contexts, it has been revealed that spatial niches serve as cohesive and recurrent units in physiological and pathological processes. These observations suggest universal tissue organization principles encoded by conserved niche patterns, and call for a query-based niche analytical paradigm beyond current computational tools. In this work, we defined the Niche Query Task, which is to identify similar niches across ST samples given a niche of interest (NOI). We further developed QueST, a specialized method for solving this task. QueST models each niche as a subgraph, uses contrastive learning to learn discriminative niche embeddings, and incorporates adversarial training to mitigate batch effects. In simulations and benchmark datasets, QueST outperformed existing methods repurposed for niche querying, accurately capturing niche structures in heterogeneous environments and demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse sequencing platforms. Applied to tertiary lymphoid structures in renal and lung cancers, QueST revealed functionally distinct niches associated with patient prognosis and uncovered conserved and divergent spatial architectures across cancer types. These results demonstrate that QueST enables systematic, quantitative profiling of spatial niches across samples, providing a powerful tool to dissect spatial tissue architecture in health and disease.

<title>DMM: Distributed Matrix Mechanism for Differentially-Private Federated Learning Based on Constant-Overhead Linear Secret Resharing</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) solutions with central Differential Privacy (DP) have seen large improvements in their utility in recent years arising from the matrix mechanism, while FL solutions with distributed (more private) DP have lagged behind. In this work, we introduce the distributed matrix mechanism to achieve the best-of-both-worlds; better privacy of distributed DP and better utility from the matrix mechanism. We accomplish this using a novel cryptographic protocol that securely transfers sensitive values across client committees of different training iterations with constant communication overhead. This protocol accommodates the dynamic participation of users required by FL, including those that may drop out from the computation. We provide experiments which show that our mechanism indeed significantly improves the utility of FL models compared to previous distributed DP mechanisms, with little added overhead.

Abstract: Open-ended text generation has become a prominent task in natural language processing due to the rise of powerful (large) language models. However, evaluating the quality of these models and the employed decoding strategies remains challenging due to trade-offs among widely used metrics such as coherence, diversity, and perplexity. This paper addresses the specific problem of multicriteria evaluation for open-ended text generation, proposing novel methods for both relative and absolute rankings of decoding methods. Specifically, we employ benchmarking approaches based on partial orderings and present a new summary metric to balance existing automatic indicators, providing a more holistic evaluation of text generation quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches offer a robust way to compare decoding strategies and serve as valuable tools to guide model selection for open-ended text generation tasks. We suggest future directions for improving evaluation methodologies in text generation and make our code, datasets, and models publicly available.

<title>Variational Bayesian Bow tie Neural Networks with Shrinkage</title>

Abstract: Despite the dominant role of deep models in machine learning, limitations persist, including overconfident predictions, susceptibility to adversarial attacks, and underestimation of variability in predictions. The Bayesian paradigm provides a natural framework to overcome such issues and has become the gold standard for uncertainty estimation with deep models, also providing improved accuracy and a framework for tuning critical hyperparameters. However, exact Bayesian inference is challenging, typically involving variational algorithms that impose strong independence and distributional assumptions. Moreover, existing methods are sensitive to the architectural choice of the network. We address these issues by focusing on a stochastic relaxation of the standard feed-forward rectified neural network and using sparsity-promoting priors on the weights of the neural network for increased robustness to architectural design. Thanks to Polya-Gamma data augmentation tricks, which render a conditionally linear and Gaussian model, we derive a fast, approximate variational inference algorithm that avoids distributional assumptions and independence across layers. Suitable strategies to further improve scalability and account for multimodality are considered.

<title>Market Making without Regret</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2411.13993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a sequential decision-making setting where, at every round $t$, a market maker posts a bid price $B_t$ and an ask price $A_t$ to an incoming trader (the taker) with a private valuation for one unit of some asset. If the trader's valuation is lower than the bid price, or higher than the ask price, then a trade (sell or buy) occurs. If a trade happens at round $t$, then letting $M_t$ be the market price (observed only at the end of round $t$), the maker's utility is $M_t - B_t$ if the maker bought the asset, and $A_t - M_t$ if they sold it. We characterize the maker's regret with respect to the best fixed choice of bid and ask pairs under a variety of assumptions (adversarial, i.i.d., and their variants) on the sequence of market prices and valuations. Our upper bound analysis unveils an intriguing connection relating market making to first-price auctions and dynamic pricing. Our main technical contribution is a lower bound for the i.i.d. case with Lipschitz distributions and independence between prices and valuations. The difficulty in the analysis stems from the unique structure of the reward and feedback functions, allowing an algorithm to acquire information by graduating the "cost of exploration" in an arbitrary way.

<title>Magneto: Combining Small and Large Language Models for Schema Matching</title>

arXiv:2412.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in language models opened new opportunities to address complex schema matching tasks. Schema matching approaches have been proposed that demonstrate the usefulness of language models, but they have also uncovered important limitations: Small language models (SLMs) require training data (which can be both expensive and challenging to obtain), and large language models (LLMs) often incur high computational costs and must deal with constraints imposed by context windows. We present Magneto, a cost-effective and accurate solution for schema matching that combines the advantages of SLMs and LLMs to address their limitations. By structuring the schema matching pipeline in two phases, retrieval and reranking, Magneto can use computationally efficient SLM-based strategies to derive candidate matches which can then be reranked by LLMs, thus making it possible to reduce runtime without compromising matching accuracy. We propose a self-supervised approach to fine-tune SLMs which uses LLMs to generate syntactically diverse training data, and prompting strategies that are effective for reranking. We also introduce a new benchmark, developed in collaboration with domain experts, which includes real biomedical datasets and presents new challenges to schema matching methods. Through a detailed experimental evaluation, using both our new and existing benchmarks, we show that Magneto is scalable and attains high accuracy for datasets from different domains.

<title>mFabric: An Efficient and Scalable Fabric for Mixture-of-Experts Training</title>

arXiv:2501.03905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models outperform conventional models by selectively activating different subnets, named \emph{experts}, on a per-token basis. This gated computation generates dynamic communications that cannot be determined beforehand, challenging the existing GPU interconnects that remain \emph{static} during the distributed training process. In this paper, we advocate for a first-of-its-kind system, called mFabric, that unlocks topology reconfiguration \emph{during} distributed MoE training. Towards this vision, we first perform a production measurement study and show that the MoE dynamic communication pattern has \emph{strong locality}, alleviating the requirement of global reconfiguration. Based on this, we design and implement a \emph{regionally reconfigurable high-bandwidth domain} on top of existing electrical interconnects using optical circuit switching (OCS), achieving scalability while maintaining rapid adaptability. We have built a fully functional mFabric prototype with commodity hardware and a customized collective communication runtime that trains state-of-the-art MoE models with \emph{in-training} topology reconfiguration across 32 A100 GPUs. Large-scale packet-level simulations show that mFabric delivers comparable performance as the non-blocking fat-tree fabric while boosting the training cost efficiency (e.g., performance per dollar) of four representative MoE models by 1.2$\times$--1.5$\times$ and 1.9$\times$--2.3$\times$ at 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps link bandwidths, respectively.

Abstract: Historically, scientific discovery has been a lengthy and costly process, demanding substantial time and resources from initial conception to final results. To accelerate scientific discovery, reduce research costs, and improve research quality, we introduce Agent Laboratory, an autonomous LLM-based framework capable of completing the entire research process. This framework accepts a human-provided research idea and progresses through three stages--literature review, experimentation, and report writing to produce comprehensive research outputs, including a code repository and a research report, while enabling users to provide feedback and guidance at each stage. We deploy Agent Laboratory with various state-of-the-art LLMs and invite multiple researchers to assess its quality by participating in a survey, providing human feedback to guide the research process, and then evaluate the final paper. We found that: (1) Agent Laboratory driven by o1-preview generates the best research outcomes; (2) The generated machine learning code is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods; (3) Human involvement, providing feedback at each stage, significantly improves the overall quality of research; (4) Agent Laboratory significantly reduces research expenses, achieving an 84% decrease compared to previous autonomous research methods. We hope Agent Laboratory enables researchers to allocate more effort toward creative ideation rather than low-level coding and writing, ultimately accelerating scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, trained on huge amount of datasets spanning multiple domains, exhibit significant reasoning, understanding, and planning capabilities across various tasks. This study presents the first-ever work in Arabic language integration within the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) domain in robotics, an area that has been notably underexplored in existing research. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art multi-lingual Small Language Models (SLMs), including GPT-4o mini, Llama 3 8B, and Phi-3 medium 14B, alongside the Arabic-centric LLM, Jais. Our approach utilizes the NavGPT framework, a pure LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to assess the impact of language on navigation reasoning through zero-shot sequential action prediction using the R2R dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of high-level planning for navigation tasks when provided with instructions in both English and Arabic. However, certain models struggled with reasoning and planning in the Arabic language due to inherent limitations in their capabilities, sub-optimal performance, and parsing issues. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing planning and reasoning capabilities in language models for effective navigation, emphasizing this as a key area for further development while also unlocking the potential of Arabic-language models for impactful real-world applications.

arXiv:2501.12982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how diffusion generative models leverage (unknown) low-dimensional structure to accelerate sampling. Focusing on two mainstream samplers -- the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) -- and assuming accurate score estimates, we prove that their iteration complexities are no greater than the order of $k/\varepsilon$ (up to some log factor), where $\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is some intrinsic dimension of the target distribution. Our results are applicable to a broad family of target distributions without requiring smoothness or log-concavity assumptions. Further, we develop a lower bound that suggests the (near) necessity of the coefficients introduced by Ho et al.(2020) and Song et al.(2020) in facilitating low-dimensional adaptation. Our findings provide the first rigorous evidence for the adaptivity of the DDIM-type samplers to unknown low-dimensional structure, and improve over the state-of-the-art DDPM theory regarding total variation convergence.

Abstract: This paper is focused on statistical learning from data that come as probability measures. In this setting, popular approaches consist in embedding such data into a Hilbert space with either Linearized Optimal Transport or Kernel Mean Embedding. However, the cost of computing such embeddings prohibits their direct use in large-scale settings. We study two methods based on measure quantization for approximating input probability measures with discrete measures of small-support size. The first one is based on optimal quantization of each input measure, while the second one relies on mean-measure quantization. We study the consistency of such approximations, and its implication for scalable embeddings of probability measures into a Hilbert space at a low computational cost. We finally illustrate our findings with various numerical experiments.

Abstract: Effective search methods are crucial for improving the performance of deep generative models at test time. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time search method, Neural Genetic Search (NGS), which incorporates the evolutionary mechanism of genetic algorithms into the generation procedure of deep models. The core idea behind NGS is its crossover, which is defined as parent-conditioned generation using trained generative models. This approach offers a versatile and easy-to-implement search algorithm for deep generative models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of NGS through experiments across three distinct domains: routing problems, adversarial prompt generation for language models, and molecular design.

arXiv:2502.17244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gait refers to the patterns of limb movement generated during walking, which are unique to each individual due to both physical and behavioral traits. Walking patterns have been widely studied in biometrics, biomechanics, sports, and rehabilitation. While traditional methods rely on video and motion capture, advances in plantar pressure sensing technology now offer deeper insights into gait. However, underfoot pressures during walking remain underexplored due to the lack of large, publicly accessible datasets. To address this, we introduce the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset: a footStep database for gait analysis and recognition using Underfoot Pressure, including data from 150 individuals. This dataset comprises high-resolution plantar pressure data (4 sensors per cm-squared) collected using a 1.2m by 3.6m pressure-sensing walkway. It contains over 200,000 footsteps from participants walking with various speeds (preferred, slow-to-stop, fast, and slow) and footwear conditions (barefoot, standard shoes, and two personal shoes), supporting advancements in biometric gait recognition and resenting new research opportunities in biomechanics and deep learning. UNB StepUP-P150 establishes a new benchmark for plantar pressure-based gait analysis and recognition.

<title>LongSpec: Long-Context Lossless Speculative Decoding with Efficient Drafting and Verification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17421</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.17421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) can now process extremely long contexts, efficient inference over these extended inputs has become increasingly important, especially for emerging applications like LLM agents that highly depend on this capability. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a promising lossless acceleration technique compared to lossy alternatives such as quantization and model cascades. However, most state-of-the-art SD methods are trained on short texts (typically fewer than 4k tokens), making them unsuitable for long-context scenarios. Specifically, adapting these methods to long contexts presents three key challenges: (1) the excessive memory demands posed by draft models due to large Key-Value (KV) cache; (2) performance degradation resulting from the mismatch between short-context training and long-context inference; and (3) inefficiencies in tree attention mechanisms when managing long token sequences. This work introduces LongSpec, a framework that addresses these challenges through three core innovations: a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized KV cache; novel position indices that mitigate the training-inference mismatch; and an attention aggregation strategy that combines fast prefix computation with standard tree attention to enable efficient decoding. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LongSpec, achieving up to a 3.26x speedup over strong Flash Attention baselines across five long-context understanding datasets, as well as a 2.25x reduction in wall-clock time on the AIME24 long reasoning task with the QwQ model, demonstrating significant latency improvements for long-context applications. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LongSpec.

Furthermore, our research highlights the need for continued exploration of option formatting to drive further improvements in model performance.

arXiv:2503.08679v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful when models face an explicit bias in their prompts, i.e., the CoT can give an incorrect picture of how models arrive at conclusions. We go further and show that unfaithful CoT can also occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. We find that when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify systematically answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We show preliminary evidence that this is due to models' implicit biases towards Yes or No, thus labeling this unfaithfulness as Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization. Our results reveal that several production models exhibit surprisingly high rates of post-hoc rationalization in our settings: GPT-4o-mini (13%) and Haiku 3.5 (7%). While frontier models are more faithful, especially thinking ones, none are entirely faithful: Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.17%), ChatGPT-4o (0.49%), DeepSeek R1 (0.37%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.14%), and Sonnet 3.7 with thinking (0.04%). We also investigate Unfaithful Illogical Shortcuts, where models use subtly illogical reasoning to try to make a speculative answer to hard maths problems seem rigorously proven. Our findings raise challenges for strategies for detecting undesired behavior in LLMs via the chain of thought.

arXiv:2503.13562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, it is often challenging to detect anomalous samples when the anomalous information they contain is extremely limited. In such cases, both macro-level and micro-level detection using multi-instance learning (MIL) encounter significant difficulties. The former struggles because normal and anomalous samples are highly similar and hard to distinguish at the macro level, while the latter is limited by the lack of labels at the micro level. In MIL, micro-level labels are inferred from macro-level labels, which can lead to severe bias. Moreover, the more imbalanced the distribution between normal and anomalous samples, the more pronounced these limitations become. In this study, we observe that the MIL problem can be elegantly transformed into a fine-grained Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem. This transformation allows us to address the imbalance issue in an unbiased manner using a micro-level balancing mechanism. To this end, we propose a novel framework-Balanced Fine-Grained Positive-Unlabeled (BFGPU)-based on rigorous theoretical foundations to address the challenges above. Extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BFGPU, which outperforms existing methods, even in extreme scenarios where both macro and micro-level distributions are highly imbalanced. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/BFGPU/BFGPU.

<title>Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks</title>

arXiv:2503.16974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&amp;As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple Generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.

<title>Mildly-Interacting Fermionic Unitaries are Efficiently Learnable</title>

Abstract: Recent work has shown that one can efficiently learn fermionic Gaussian unitaries, also commonly known as nearest-neighbor matchcircuits or non-interacting fermionic unitaries. However, one could ask a similar question about unitaries that are near Gaussian: for example, unitaries prepared with a small number of non-Gaussian circuit elements. These operators find significance in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, yet no algorithm exists to learn them.
  We give the first such result by devising an algorithm which makes queries to an $n$-mode fermionic unitary $U$ prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates and returns a circuit approximating $U$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ in time $\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$. This resolves a central open question of Mele and Herasymenko under the strongest distance metric. In fact, our algorithm is much more general: we define a property of unitary Gaussianity known as unitary Gaussian dimension and show that our algorithm can learn $n$-mode unitaries of Gaussian dimension at least $2n - O(t)$ in time $\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$. Indeed, this class subsumes unitaries prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates but also includes several unitaries that require up to $2^{O(t)}$ non-Gaussian gates to construct.
  In addition, we give a $\textrm{poly}(n,1/\varepsilon)$-time algorithm to distinguish whether an $n$-mode unitary is of Gaussian dimension at least $k$ or $\varepsilon$-far from all such unitaries in Frobenius distance, promised that one is the case. Along the way, we prove structural results about near-Gaussian fermionic unitaries that are likely to be of independent interest.

Abstract: A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to classify T1-weighted brain MRI scans as healthy or Alzheimer. The network comprises 3D convolution, pooling, batch normalization, dense ReLU layers, and a sigmoid output. Using stochastic noise injection and five-fold cross-validation, the model achieved test set accuracy of 0.912 and area under the ROC curve of 0.961, an improvement of approximately 0.027 over resizing alone. Sensitivity and specificity both exceeded 0.90. These results align with prior work reporting up to 0.10 gain via synthetic augmentation. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of simple augmentation for 3D MRI classification and motivate future exploration of advanced augmentation methods and architectures such as 3D U-Net and vision transformers.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models represent an important step toward general-purpose robotic systems by integrating visual perception, language understanding, and action execution. However, systematic evaluation of these models, particularly their zero-shot generalization capabilities in procedurally out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, remains limited. In this paper, we introduce MultiNet v0.2, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the generalization performance of state-of-the-art VLMs and VLAs - including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, OpenVLA, Pi0 Base, and Pi0 FAST - on diverse procedural tasks from the Procgen benchmark. Our analysis reveals several critical insights: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant limitations in zero-shot generalization to OOD tasks, with performance heavily influenced by factors such as action representation and task complexity; (2) VLAs generally outperforms other models due to their robust architectural design; and (3) VLM variants demonstrate substantial improvements when constrained appropriately, highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to precise prompt engineering. We release our benchmark, evaluation framework, and findings to enable the assessment of future VLA models and identify critical areas for improvement in their application to out-of-distribution digital tasks.

<title>ArrayDPS: Unsupervised Blind Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior</title>

Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR. Audio demos are provided at: https://arraydps.github.io/ArrayDPSDemo/.

<title>Spline Dimensional Decomposition with Interpolation-based Optimal Knot Selection for Stochastic Dynamic Analysis</title>

Abstract: Forward uncertainty quantification in dynamical systems is challenging due to non-smooth or locally oscillating nonlinear behaviors. Spline dimensional decomposition (SDD) addresses such nonlinearity by partitioning input coordinates via knot placement, but its accuracy is highly sensitive to internal knot locations. Optimizing knots using sequential quadratic programming is effective, yet computationally expensive. We propose a computationally efficient, interpolation-based method for optimal knot selection in SDD. The method includes: (1) interpolating input-output profiles, (2) defining subinterval-based reference regions, and (3) selecting knots at maximum gradient points within each region. The resulting knot vector is then applied to SDD for accurate approximation of non-smooth and oscillatory responses. A modal analysis of a lower control arm shows that SDD with the proposed knots yields higher accuracy than SDD with uniformly or randomly spaced knots and a Gaussian process model. In this example, the proposed SDD achieves the lowest relative variance error (2.89%) for the first natural frequency distribution, compared to uniformly spaced knots (12.310%), randomly spaced knots (15.274%), and Gaussian process (5.319%). All surrogates are constructed using the same 401 simulation datasets, and errors are evaluated against a 2000-sample Monte Carlo simulation. Scalability and applicability are demonstrated through stochastic and reliability analyses of one- and three-dimensional benchmark functions, and a ten-dimensional lower control arm model. Results confirm that second-moment statistics and reliability estimates can be accurately obtained with only a few hundred function evaluations or finite element simulations.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 16.8 mAP! Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/roboflow/rf100-vl/ and https://universe.roboflow.com/rf100-vl/

Abstract: Nowadays, formal theorem provers have made monumental progress on high-school and competition-level mathematics, but few of them generalize to more advanced mathematics. In this paper, we present REAL-Prover, a new open-source stepwise theorem prover for Lean 4 to push this boundary. This prover, based on our fine-tuned large language model (REAL-Prover-v1) and integrated with a retrieval system (Leansearch-PS), notably boosts performance on solving college-level mathematics problems. To train REAL-Prover-v1, we developed HERALD-AF, a data extraction pipeline that converts natural language math problems into formal statements, and a new open-source Lean 4 interactive environment (Jixia-interactive) to facilitate synthesis data collection. In our experiments, our prover using only supervised fine-tune achieves competitive results with a 23.7% success rate (Pass@64) on the ProofNet dataset-comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To further evaluate our approach, we introduce FATE-M, a new benchmark focused on algebraic problems, where our prover achieves a SOTA success rate of 56.7% (Pass@64).

<title>Information-Computation Gaps in Quantum Learning via Low-Degree Likelihood</title>

arXiv:2505.22743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data, designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.

arXiv:2505.23145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.

arXiv:2506.00854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a three-fold pseudo-label weighting module designed for three key purposes: selecting and filtering pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language processing datasets and ranking first according to the Friedman test among 19 methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26% -- and data imbalance is a key factor for many text classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling framework for real-time market prediction under uncertain workloads. Motivated by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to maximize predictive accuracy while satisfying per-task deadline constraints. Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain labels. We evaluate TIP-Search on three real-world limit order book datasets (FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.

arXiv:2506.09250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shojaee et al. (2025) report that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit "accuracy collapse" on planning puzzles beyond certain complexity thresholds. We demonstrate that their findings primarily reflect experimental design limitations rather than fundamental reasoning failures. Our analysis reveals three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments risk exceeding model output token limits, with models explicitly acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors' automated evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3) Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically impossible instances for N > 5 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.

Summary: 
The study explores the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to structural interventions during inference. Surprisingly, even after deleting or swapping adjacent layers, the models maintain 72-95% of their initial top-1 prediction accuracy without any further adjustments. The research reveals that the sensitivity to interventions is not consistent across all layers, with the early and final layers experiencing the most significant impact while the middle layers show greater resilience. This observation leads to the identification of four stages of inference in LLMs: detokenization, feature engineering, prediction ensembling, and residual sharpening. These stages highlight how local context is integrated, features are refined, hidden states are aggregated, and irrelevant features are suppressed during the inference process. By combining behavioral and mechanistic evidence, a framework is provided to interpret depth-dependent computations in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to structural interventions by deleting and swapping adjacent layers during inference. Surprisingly, models retain 72-95% of their original top-1 prediction accuracy without any fine-tuning. We find that performance degradation is not uniform across layers: interventions to the early and final layers cause the most degradation, while the model is remarkably robust to dropping middle layers. This pattern of localized sensitivity motivates our hypothesis of four stages of inference, observed across diverse model families and sizes: (1) detokenization, where local context is integrated to lift raw token embeddings into higher-level representations; (2) feature engineering, where task- and entity-specific features are iteratively refined; (3) prediction ensembling, where hidden states are aggregated into plausible next-token predictions; and (4) residual sharpening, where irrelevant features are suppressed to finalize the output distribution. Synthesizing behavioral and mechanistic evidence, we provide a framework for interpreting depth-dependent computations in LLMs.

arXiv:2410.23884v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to robustly identify causal relationships is essential for autonomous decision-making and adaptation to novel scenarios. However, accurately inferring causal structure requires integrating both world knowledge and abstract logical reasoning. In this work, we investigate the interaction between these two capabilities through the representative task of causal reasoning over narratives. Through controlled synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world experiments, we find that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) often rely on superficial heuristics -- for example, inferring causality from event order or recalling memorized world knowledge without attending to context. Furthermore, we show that simple reformulations of the task can elicit more robust reasoning behavior. Our evaluation spans a range of causal structures, from linear chains to complex graphs involving colliders and forks. These findings uncover systematic patterns in how LLMs perform causal reasoning and lay the groundwork for developing methods that better align LLM behavior with principled causal inference.

This study introduces a Bayesian framework using Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to extrapolate neural scaling laws. By creating a prior distribution that samples synthetic functions resembling real-world scaling laws, the PFN can meta-learn extrapolation.

This approach allows for reliable and uncertainty-aware extrapolation, crucial for decision-making applications involving neural scaling and resource investment. <div>

Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning. Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation. Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws, allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable, uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design component through ablation studies.

H$^2$GFM is a novel framework that extends the Graph Foundation Model (GFM) to handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous text-attributed graphs (TAGs). It projects meta-relations among graphs into a unified textual space and uses context encoding to capture spatial and semantic relationships. A context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT) is proposed to generate robust node representations by considering both context neighbors and their relationships. Additionally, a mixture of CGT experts is employed to capture the diversity in structural patterns across different graph types.

Abstract: The growing interests and applications of graph learning in diverse domains have propelled the development of a unified model generalizing well across different graphs and tasks, known as the Graph Foundation Model (GFM). Existing research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

Summary:
The article presents an optimization framework for variational inference that incorporates the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family, including heavy-tailed distributions like the generalized Pareto and the Student's t. By utilizing the coupled free energy, accuracy and robustness of the learned model are enhanced. The method introduces a coupled generalization of the Fisher Information metric and the affine connection, which is applied to designing a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). This approach involves sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its coupled probability, resulting in a model that is robust against outliers and provides stability during training. The CVAE outperforms the traditional VAE in reconstructing CelebA images, showing a 3% improvement after just 5 epochs of training. <div>

Abstract: We introduce an optimization framework for variational inference based on the coupled free energy, extending variational inference techniques to account for the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family. This family includes important heavy-tailed distributions such as the generalized Pareto and the Student's t. By leveraging the coupled free energy, which is equal to the coupled evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the inverted probabilities, we improve the accuracy and robustness of the learned model. The coupled generalization of Fisher Information metric and the affine connection. The method is applied to the design of a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). By using the coupling for both the distributions and cost functions, the reconstruction metric is derived to still be the mean-square average loss with modified constants. The novelty comes from sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its associated coupled probability, which has faster decaying tails. The result is the ability to train a model robust against severe outliers, while assuring that the training process is stable. The Wasserstein-2 or Fr\'echet Inception Distance of the reconstructed CelebA images shows the CVAE has a 3\% improvement over the VAE after 5 epochs of training.

<div> reinforcement learning, reward modeling, language models, generation probabilities, regularization

Summary:
Reinforcement learning with large language models relies on reward models to improve performance, especially in scenarios like reinforcement learning from human feedback. Current reward modeling based on overall response scores may struggle to identify specific components within response trajectories that correlate with scores, leading to poor generalization. This paper proposes leveraging generation probabilities to establish reward consistency across processes in response trajectories, providing fine-grained signals for reward learning. An intra-trajectory consistency regularization is introduced to ensure that adjacent processes with higher generation probabilities maintain more consistent rewards. Application of this regularization improves the performance of the outcome reward model on RewardBench and induces better policies aligned with desired policy objectives. The trained reward model also achieves improved results in best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification tasks. The code implementing the proposed methodology is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

Summary:
Location Preference Optimization (LPO) is introduced as a novel approach to enhance interactions with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by leveraging locational data to optimize interaction preferences. LPO predicts interaction positions using information entropy and a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance. It is supported by Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) to facilitate extensive exploration of GUI environments and improve interaction precision.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

Summary:
- The article addresses the challenge of selecting a subset of evaluation metrics from a larger pool for efficiency and interpretability.
- It introduces the concepts of positional representation and positional proportionality to ensure fairness in metric selection.
- Upper and lower bounds on the minimum number of metrics required to satisfy these properties are established.
- A generalized form of these properties that considers group representation is also examined.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A common problem in LLM evaluation is how to choose a subset of metrics from a full suite of possible metrics. Subset selection is usually done for efficiency or interpretability reasons, and the goal is often to select a ``representative'' subset of metrics. However, ``representative'' is rarely clearly defined. In this work, we use ideas from social choice theory to formalize two notions of representation for the selection of a subset of evaluation metrics. We first introduce positional representation, which guarantees every alternative is sufficiently represented at every position cutoff. We then introduce positional proportionality, which guarantees no alternative is proportionally over- or under-represented by more than a small error at any position. We prove upper and lower bounds on the smallest number of metrics needed to guarantee either of these properties in the worst case. We also study a generalized form of each property that allows for additional input on groups of metrics that must be represented. Finally, we tie theory to practice through real-world case studies on both LLM evaluation and hospital quality evaluation.

<div> Keywords: large language models, instruction following, complex instructions, reinforcement learning, reasoning <br />
<br />
Summary:  
This study addresses the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in following complex instructions, proposing a method to enhance their capabilities. The traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) approach is found to be ineffective as it only paraphrases instructions without deep reasoning. The proposed method focuses on decomposing complex instructions, acquiring data systematically, and using reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-centric rewards to cultivate reasoning skills. By incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling and utilizing sample-wise contrast and behavior cloning, the method enhances LLM performance significantly. Evaluations on seven benchmarks show a 11.74% improvement in performance for a 1.5B LLM compared to an 8B LLM. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions. <br />

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data will be available later (under review).

<div> collapse, generative models, recursive training, probability distribution, asymptotic behavior
Summary:
Recursive training of generative models can sometimes lead to the collapse of the simulated probability distribution. This study shows that the outcome varies asymptotically based on the presence or absence of even a minor external sample contribution. The collapse phenomenon is observed to manifest differently in scenarios where external sources influence the training process. Understanding these two distinct behaviors can provide valuable insights into optimizing generative model training algorithms and addressing issues related to collapse in simulated probability distributions. <div>

Abstract: It is known that recursive training from generative models can lead to the so called `collapse' of the simulated probability distribution. This note shows that one in fact gets two different asymptotic behaviours depending on whether an external source, howsoever minor, is also contributing samples.

Summary: <br />
This study explores the use of pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models (PLMs) to improve audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) by incorporating linguistic constraints as additional supervision signals. The proposed approach enhances speech quality and intelligibility without added computational cost during inference. The method shows consistent performance improvements in both multi-language settings and scenarios where visual cues are impaired. By leveraging linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, similar to how humans support speech perception, the AV-TSE model benefits from auxiliary sources of information provided by PSLMs and PLMs. The study demonstrates the robustness of the approach and its potential to enhance AV-TSE models for extracting target speakers in audio-visual data. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models (PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show robust performance gains.

Summary:
FlexQuant is a dynamic precision-switching framework designed to optimize the balance between inference speed and accuracy in large language models (LLMs). It leverages model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to enable fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and adjust bit-widths during token generation. The framework offers a flexible and adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment by dynamically managing precision requirements. Experimental results show that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across various language tasks while maintaining negligible accuracy loss. This approach addresses the memory bottleneck caused by the scaling of LLM parameter sizes compared to hardware capabilities, providing an effective solution for improving the deployment efficiency of large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has exacerbated the memory bottleneck due to the widening gap between model parameter scaling and hardware capabilities. While post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques effectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on static quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads. To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, FlexQuant enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained precision management. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible accuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment.

Summary:
The article introduces a new deep learning method, Unbalanced Learning of Optimal Transport (ULOT), which predicts optimal transport plans between two graphs. It is trained using the fused unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) loss and employs a neural architecture with cross-attention conditioned on FUGW hyperparameters. ULOT demonstrates competitive loss prediction up to two orders of magnitude faster than traditional solvers, making it more scalable for large graphs. The predicted transport plan can serve as a warm start for classical solvers to enhance convergence speed. Additionally, the model's predicted transport plan is fully differentiable in relation to graph inputs and FUGW hyperparameters, facilitating the optimization of functionals of the ULOT plan. This advancement in deep learning offers a promising approach for efficient graph comparison and alignment.

Abstract: Optimal transport between graphs, based on Gromov-Wasserstein and
  other extensions, is a powerful tool for comparing and aligning
  graph structures. However, solving the associated non-convex
  optimization problems is computationally expensive, which limits the
  scalability of these methods to large graphs. In this work, we
  present Unbalanced Learning of Optimal Transport (ULOT), a deep
  learning method that predicts optimal transport plans between two
  graphs. Our method is trained by minimizing the fused unbalanced
  Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) loss. We propose a novel neural
  architecture with cross-attention that is conditioned on the FUGW
  tradeoff hyperparameters. We evaluate ULOT on synthetic stochastic
  block model (SBM) graphs and on real cortical surface data obtained
  from fMRI. ULOT predicts transport plans with competitive loss up to
  two orders of magnitude faster than classical solvers. Furthermore,
  the predicted plan can be used as a warm start for classical solvers
  to accelerate their convergence. Finally, the predicted transport
  plan is fully differentiable with respect to the graph inputs and
  FUGW hyperparameters, enabling the optimization of functionals of
  the ULOT plan.

Summary:
Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for various maritime applications. Traditional data-driven models often lack physical constraints, leading to inaccurate forecasts. In this study, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach is proposed for trajectory prediction by integrating a kinematic model for vessel motion into the neural network training process. The method utilizes a physics-based loss function that enforces adherence to fundamental physical principles through penalizing deviations from expected kinematic behavior. Evaluation on real-world AIS datasets shows that the proposed PINN approach significantly reduces average displacement errors by up to 32% compared to state-of-the-art models while maintaining physical consistency. This improved accuracy in trajectory prediction enhances model reliability and suitability for mission-critical maritime activities, ultimately leading to better situational awareness in marine environments.

arXiv:2506.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is crucial for navigational safety, route optimization, traffic management, search and rescue operations, and autonomous navigation. Traditional data-driven models lack real-world physical constraints, leading to forecasts that disobey vessel motion dynamics, such as in scenarios with limited or noisy data where sudden course changes or speed variations occur due to external factors. To address this limitation, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for trajectory prediction that integrates a streamlined kinematic model for vessel motion into the neural network training process via a first- and second-order, finite difference physics-based loss function. This loss function, discretized using the first-order forward Euler method, Heun's second-order approximation, and refined with a midpoint approximation based on Taylor series expansion, enforces fidelity to fundamental physical principles by penalizing deviations from expected kinematic behavior. We evaluated PINN using real-world AIS datasets that cover diverse maritime conditions and compared it with state-of-the-art models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces average displacement errors by up to 32% across models and datasets while maintaining physical consistency. These results enhance model reliability and adherence to mission-critical maritime activities, where precision translates into better situational awareness in the oceans.

Abstract: Understanding socio-academic and economic factors influencing students' performance is crucial for effective educational interventions. This study employs several machine learning techniques and causal analysis to predict and elucidate the impacts of these factors on academic performance. We constructed a hypothetical causal graph and collected data from 1,050 student profiles. Following meticulous data cleaning and visualization, we analyze linear relationships through correlation and variable plots, and perform causal analysis on the hypothetical graph. Regression and classification models are applied for prediction, and unsupervised causality analysis using PC, GES, ICA-LiNGAM, and GRASP algorithms is conducted. Our regression analysis shows that Ridge Regression achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.12 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.024, indicating robustness, while classification models like Random Forest achieve nearly perfect F1-scores. The causal analysis shows significant direct and indirect effects of factors such as class attendance, study hours, and group study on CGPA. These insights are validated through unsupervised causality analysis. By integrating the best regression model into a web application, we are developing a practical tool for students and educators to enhance academic outcomes based on empirical evidence.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has recently emerged as a crucial research area, as data from distributed clients typically arrives as a stream, requiring sequential learning. This paper explores a more practical and challenging FCL setting, where clients may have unrelated or even conflicting data and tasks. In this scenario, statistical heterogeneity and data noise can create spurious correlations, leading to biased feature learning and catastrophic forgetting. Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL.

However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Spatio-Temporal grAdient Matching with network-free Prototype (STAMP). Our contributions are threefold: 1) We develop a model-agnostic method to determine subset of samples that effectively form prototypes when using a prototypical network, making it resilient to continual learning challenges; 2) We introduce a spatio-temporal gradient matching approach, applied at both the client-side (temporal) and server-side (spatial), to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and data heterogeneity; 3) We leverage prototypes to approximate task-wise gradients, improving gradient matching on the client-side.

Neural watermarking using a convolutional autoencoder is proposed for ensuring data integrity in high-dimensional fields like climate modeling and fluid simulations. The framework invisibly embeds binary messages into structured data such as temperature and vorticity, maintaining near-original fidelity (sub-1% MSE) and persistence under lossy transformations.

Abstract: We present a robust neural watermarking framework for scientific data integrity, targeting high-dimensional fields common in climate modeling and fluid simulations. Using a convolutional autoencoder, binary messages are invisibly embedded into structured data such as temperature, vorticity, and geopotential. Our method ensures watermark persistence under lossy transformations - including noise injection, cropping, and compression - while maintaining near-original fidelity (sub-1\% MSE). Compared to classical singular value decomposition (SVD)-based watermarking, our approach achieves $>$98\% bit accuracy and visually indistinguishable reconstructions across ERA5 and Navier-Stokes datasets. This system offers a scalable, model-compatible tool for data provenance, auditability, and traceability in high-performance scientific workflows, and contributes to the broader goal of securing AI systems through verifiable, physics-aware watermarking. We evaluate on physically grounded scientific datasets as a representative stress-test; the framework extends naturally to other structured domains such as satellite imagery and autonomous-vehicle perception streams.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces EMERGENT, a new approach to one-sided matching problems using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets). These networks help in sampling diverse and high-reward solutions, leading to efficient and manipulation-resistant matches. EMERGENT balances efficiency and strategyproofness by producing matches that are both efficient and less vulnerable to manipulation compared to existing algorithms like Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD), Probabilistic Serial (PS), and Rank Minimization (RM). Experimental results show that EMERGENT outperforms RSD in rank efficiency while reducing strategic vulnerability. The study demonstrates the potential of GFlowNets in social choice mechanisms to address the trade-off between efficiency and manipulability. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The design of fair and efficient algorithms for allocating public resources, such as school admissions, housing, or medical residency, has a profound social impact. In one-sided matching problems, where individuals are assigned to items based on ranked preferences, a fundamental trade-off exists between efficiency and strategyproofness. Existing algorithms like Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD), Probabilistic Serial (PS), and Rank Minimization (RM) capture only one side of this trade-off: RSD is strategyproof but inefficient, while PS and RM are efficient but incentivize manipulation. We propose EMERGENT, a novel application of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to one-sided matching, leveraging its ability to sample diverse, high-reward solutions. In our approach, efficient and manipulation-resistant matches emerge naturally: high-reward solutions yield efficient matches, while the stochasticity of GFlowNets-based outputs reduces incentives for manipulation.

<div> forgetting curves, neural networks, cognitive science, memory decay, spaced repetition
<br />
Neural networks and cognitive science are linked in this study that explores if artificial models demonstrate human-like forgetting curves. Using Ebbinghaus' memory decay theory and spaced repetition principles, a framework is proposed to measure information retention in neural networks. The recall probability is calculated by comparing the network's current hidden state with previously stored prototype representations. This metric helps schedule review sessions to prevent catastrophic forgetting during deployment and improve training efficiency by prompting targeted reviews. Experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons show that neural networks exhibit human-like forgetting curves, with knowledge becoming more robust through scheduled reviews. The alignment between neural network forgetting curves and human memory models suggests that neural networks naturally emulate human memory decay, offering insights into continual learning algorithms.

Abstract: This study bridges cognitive science and neural network design by examining whether artificial models exhibit human-like forgetting curves. Drawing upon Ebbinghaus' seminal work on memory decay and principles of spaced repetition, we propose a quantitative framework to measure information retention in neural networks. Our approach computes the recall probability by evaluating the similarity between a network's current hidden state and previously stored prototype representations. This retention metric facilitates the scheduling of review sessions, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting during deployment and enhancing training efficiency by prompting targeted reviews. Our experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons reveal human-like forgetting curves, with knowledge becoming increasingly robust through scheduled reviews. This alignment between neural network forgetting curves and established human memory models identifies neural networks as an architecture that naturally emulates human memory decay and can inform state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms.

<div> cache-aware attention, selective KV refresh, MAR models, image generation, efficiency
<br />
MARch\'e proposes a new framework for efficient masked autoregressive (MAR) image generation. By introducing cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh, MARch\'e partitions tokens into active and cached sets, allowing for efficient reuse of key/value projections while ensuring contextually relevant information is refreshed as needed. This approach significantly reduces redundant computation in MAR models without altering the underlying architecture. Empirically, MARch\'e achieves up to a 1.7x speedup in generation tasks while maintaining image quality. This makes MARch\'e a scalable and broadly applicable solution for enhancing the efficiency of masked transformer generation processes.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked autoregressive (MAR) models unify the strengths of masked and autoregressive generation by predicting tokens in a fixed order using bidirectional attention for image generation. While effective, MAR models suffer from significant computational overhead, as they recompute attention and feed-forward representations for all tokens at every decoding step, despite most tokens remaining semantically stable across steps. We propose a training-free generation framework MARch\'e to address this inefficiency through two key components: cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh. Cache-aware attention partitions tokens into active and cached sets, enabling separate computation paths that allow efficient reuse of previously computed key/value projections without compromising full-context modeling. But a cached token cannot be used indefinitely without recomputation due to the changing contextual information over multiple steps. MARch\'e recognizes this challenge and applies a technique called selective KV refresh. Selective KV refresh identifies contextually relevant tokens based on attention scores from newly generated tokens and updates only those tokens that require recomputation, while preserving image generation quality. MARch\'e significantly reduces redundant computation in MAR without modifying the underlying architecture. Empirically, MARch\'e achieves up to 1.7x speedup with negligible impact on image quality, offering a scalable and broadly applicable solution for efficient masked transformer generation.

<title>A Minimalist Method for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, text-to-image diffusion models, fine-tuning, noise optimization, alignment

Summary:
Noise PPO is a new minimalist reinforcement learning algorithm designed to optimize the initial noise distribution in text-to-image diffusion models. The approach focuses on improving text-image alignment and sample quality without the need for trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance techniques. By leaving the pre-trained diffusion model frozen and learning a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator, Noise PPO simplifies the fine-tuning process. Experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently enhances alignment and sample quality, especially at low inference steps. While the benefits of noise optimization diminish with an increasing number of inference steps, they remain present. These findings shed light on the "golden noise" hypothesis and highlight the practical value of minimalist reinforcement learning for improving diffusion models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.

<div> Keywords: large language models, block coordinate descent, training cost, GPU clusters, model accuracy

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new framework for efficiently training large language models on affordable RTX 4090 GPU clusters. By utilizing block coordinate descent (BCD) and engineering optimizations, the framework significantly reduces pre-training costs compared to traditional methods. BCD ensures model convergence and performs gradient computation at the level of parameter blocks. Results show that BCD lowers training costs by approximately 33% on A100 and A800 clusters while achieving a cost reduction of approximately 2.6% on RTX 4090 clusters for the 7B model. Additionally, BCD enables seamless migration of large-scale models from high-end A100 clusters to more cost-effective 4090 clusters without compromising model accuracy. In both scenarios, BCD training retains the same level of model accuracy as traditional full-parameter pre-training. This framework provides a cost-effective solution for small- to medium-sized teams looking to train large language models efficiently.

Abstract: Training large language models typically demands extensive GPU memory and substantial financial investment, which poses a barrier for many small- to medium-sized teams. In this paper, we present a full-parameter pre-training framework based on block coordinate descent (BCD), augmented with engineering optimizations, to efficiently train large models on affordable RTX 4090 GPU clusters. BCD ensures model convergence based on block coordinate descent theory and performs gradient computation and update at the level of parameter blocks. Experiments show that 1) Lower cost of Same-Device: BCD significantly reduces pre-training cost. For the 7B model, under identical hardware settings, BCD lowers training costs to approximately 33% on A100,A800 clusters on 7B model averagely and to approximately 2.6% on RTX 4090 clusters on 7B model, compared to traditional full-parameter training. 2) Cross-Device Transfer: By leveraging BCD, large-scale models previously trainable only on high-end A100 clusters can be seamlessly migrated and pre-trained on 4090 clusters-whose hourly cost is only one-quarter that of A100-without requiring expensive hardware. 3) Accuracy Retention: In both scenarios, BCD training achieves the same level of model accuracy as full-parameter pre-training.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the BTC-LLM framework for sub-1-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs). It addresses challenges faced by existing sparsity-aware binarization methods, focusing on performance degradation, computational complexity, and limited hardware compatibility. BTC-LLM incorporates a Learnable Transformation that optimizes scaling and rotation matrices to align binary weights with full-precision distributions.

Abstract: Binary quantization represents the most extreme form of large language model (LLM) compression, reducing weights to $\pm$1 for maximal memory and computational efficiency. While recent sparsity-aware binarization methods achieve sub-1-bit compression by pruning redundant binary weights, they suffer from three critical challenges: performance deterioration, computational complexity from sparse mask management, and limited hardware compatibility. In this paper, we present BTC-LLM, a novel sub-1-bit LLM quantization framework that leverages adaptive weight transformation and binary pattern clustering to overcome these limitations, delivering both superior accuracy and efficiency. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Learnable Transformation that optimizes invertible scaling and rotation matrices to align binarized weights with full-precision distributions, enabling incoherence processing to enhance layer-wise representation quality; (2) a Flash and Accurate Binary Codebook that identifies recurring binary vector clusters, compressing them into compact indices with tailored distance metrics and sign-based centroid updates. This eliminates the need for sparse masks, enabling efficient inference on standard hardware. Our code is available at https://github.com/Chooovy/BTC-LLM.

<div> pruning, neural network, metanetwork, graph neural network, automatic pruning<br />
<br />Summary:
This research introduces a novel approach to network pruning by utilizing a metanetwork derived from meta-learning. By establishing a mapping between neural networks and graphs, a graph neural network is employed as the metanetwork to automatically learn a pruning strategy. The trained metanetwork can transform difficult-to-prune networks into more manageable ones, leading to state-of-the-art pruning results on various tasks. The approach involves feeding networks through the metanetwork and then fine-tuning to achieve effective pruning. The method outperforms existing techniques on popular pruning tasks for models like ResNet56, VGG19, and ResNet50 on datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet. The code for this research is publicly available on GitHub, enabling further exploration and application of the proposed method.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network pruning, aimed at reducing network size while preserving accuracy, has attracted significant research interest. Numerous pruning techniques have been proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more complex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of neural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we "use a neural network to prune neural networks". More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and the standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our method achieved outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including ResNet56 on CIFAR10, VGG19 on CIFAR100, ResNet50 on ImageNet).

Summary:
The article introduces CRITS, a new method for interpretable time series classification. CRITS includes a layer of convolutional kernels, max-pooling layer, and a fully-connected rectifier network. It leverages rectified linear unit activation to extract feature weights for local explanations without the need for gradients or random perturbations. The method is evaluated on various datasets to analyze its classification performance, explanation alignment, sensitivity, and understandability. CRITS addresses issues prevalent in existing interpretability methods for convolutional network-based classifiers, offering detailed explanations in the input space and eliminating upscaling challenges.

Abstract: Several interpretability methods for convolutional network-based classifiers exist. Most of these methods focus on extracting saliency maps for a given sample, providing a local explanation that highlights the main regions for the classification. However, some of these methods lack detailed explanations in the input space due to upscaling issues or may require random perturbations to extract the explanations. We propose Convolutional Rectifier for Interpretable Time Series Classification, or CRITS, as an interpretable model for time series classification that is designed to intrinsically extract local explanations. The proposed method uses a layer of convolutional kernels, a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected rectifier network (a network with only rectified linear unit activations). The rectified linear unit activation allows the extraction of the feature weights for the given sample, eliminating the need to calculate gradients, use random perturbations and the upscale of the saliency maps to the initial input space. We evaluate CRITS on a set of datasets, and study its classification performance and its explanation alignment, sensitivity and understandability.

The study explores low-bit weight-only quantization's impact on large language models (LLMs) and identifies strong correlations (avg. 0.82) in quantization errors of diverse 3-4 bit methods on FineWeb examples. The research suggests that residual stream magnitudes in full-precision models can predict future quantization errors and presents a hypothesis linking residual stream magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation across layers. By implementing LLM localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, the study demonstrates that examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in late layers and highlights the significance of MLP gates in maintaining perplexity. The findings shed light on why certain examples experience significant quantization errors and identify critical model components essential for performance preservation. <div>

Abstract: Low-bit weight-only quantization significantly reduces the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs), but disproportionately affects certain examples. We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large quantization errors and which model components are most critical for performance preservation.

Summary: 
The Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON) is introduced as a spatiotemporal neural operator architecture aimed at accurately reconstructing global scalar fields from sparse and non-uniform proxy measurements. Unlike traditional approaches, TRON focuses on the inverse problem of reconstructing current global fields from sparse, evolving sensor sequences. Trained on 22 years of simulation data, TRON generalizes across various spatial locations, days, and sequence lengths, achieving sub-second inference with low relative L2 errors. Specifically applied in cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction from sparse data. Its potential applications extend to atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting. <div>

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of latent environmental fields from sparse and indirect observations is a foundational challenge across scientific domains-from atmospheric science and geophysics to public health and aerospace safety. Traditional approaches rely on physics-based simulators or dense sensor networks, both constrained by high computational cost, latency, or limited spatial coverage. We present the Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON), a spatiotemporal neural operator architecture designed to infer continuous global scalar fields from sequences of sparse, non-uniform proxy measurements.
  Unlike recent forecasting models that operate on dense, gridded inputs to predict future states, TRON addresses a more ill-posed inverse problem: reconstructing the current global field from sparse, temporally evolving sensor sequences, without access to future observations or dense labels. Demonstrated on global cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON is trained on 22 years of simulation data and generalizes across 65,341 spatial locations, 8,400 days, and sequence lengths from 7 to 90 days. It achieves sub-second inference with relative L2 errors below 0.1%, representing a >58,000X speedup over Monte Carlo-based estimators. Though evaluated in the context of cosmic radiation, TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction from sparse data, with applications in atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting.

Summary:
The paper introduces GUST, a framework for quantifying free-form geometric uncertainties in metamaterial manufacturing. GUST utilizes deep generative models to learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of as-fabricated unit cell geometries based on nominal designs. It employs a two-stage learning process, starting with self-supervised pretraining on a synthetic dataset to capture structure variability and approximate distributions. Transfer learning is then used to fine-tune the model on real-world manufacturing data. GUST's effectiveness is showcased with only 960 additively manufactured unit cells in two passes, demonstrating its ability to capture geometry and material property variability. Directly training on the same amount of real-world data proves insufficient. This scalable and cost-effective approach reduces data requirements while effectively learning complex geometric uncertainties, making it suitable for industries like aerospace and biomedical engineering where understanding and mitigating manufacturing uncertainties is crucial. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces GUST (Generative Uncertainty learning via Self-supervised pretraining and Transfer learning), a framework for quantifying free-form geometric uncertainties inherent in the manufacturing of metamaterials. GUST leverages the representational power of deep generative models to learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of as-fabricated unit cell geometries given nominal designs, thereby enabling uncertainty quantification. To address the scarcity of real-world manufacturing data, GUST employs a two-stage learning process. First, it leverages self-supervised pretraining on a large-scale synthetic dataset to capture the structure variability inherent in metamaterial geometries and an approximated distribution of as-fabricated geometries given nominal designs. Subsequently, GUST employs transfer learning by fine-tuning the pretrained model on limited real-world manufacturing data, allowing it to adapt to specific manufacturing processes and nominal designs. With only 960 unit cells additively manufactured in only two passes, GUST can capture the variability in geometry and effective material properties. In contrast, directly training a generative model on the same amount of real-world data proves insufficient, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. This scalable and cost-effective approach significantly reduces data requirements while maintaining the effectiveness in learning complex, real-world geometric uncertainties, offering an affordable method for free-form geometric uncertainty quantification in the manufacturing of metamaterials. The capabilities of GUST hold significant promise for high-precision industries such as aerospace and biomedical engineering, where understanding and mitigating manufacturing uncertainties are critical.

Abstract: Interpreting large volumes of high-dimensional, unlabeled data in a manner that is comprehensible to humans remains a significant challenge across various domains. In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve health outcomes.

Summary: <br />
This dissertation addresses the challenges faced by practitioners in selecting the most suitable deep learning pipeline for new datasets. By utilizing meta-learning, automated machine learning techniques are extended to the deep learning domain. The proposed empirical approaches automate the selection of deep learning pipelines for Computer Vision tasks based on prior task knowledge. The research also extends to the language domain, demonstrating improved performance in finetuning large language models compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The growing number of pretrained models in Machine Learning (ML) presents significant challenges for practitioners. Given a new dataset, they need to determine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the pretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as models grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a bottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively. Addressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and hyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and more of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data augmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine learning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally designed for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts meta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain. We propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer Vision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline ranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune large language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform finetuning foundation models. Additionally, we meta-learn data augmentation and synthetic data to enhance performance in up-stream and down-stream tasks. We empirically show the underestimated importance of data augmentation when using Self-Supervised Learning and meta-learn advanced data augmentation strategies. Leveraging synthetic data, we also propose to meta-learn neural synthetic data generators as proxies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments. Additionally, we learn a multiple-environment world model in an in-context learning fashion by purely using synthetic, randomly sampled data.

<div> linearity score, neural networks, function approximation, regression, interpretability

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of the linearity score $\lambda(f)$ as a measure to assess how well a neural network's output can be replicated by a linear model. This score is calculated as the $R^2$ between the network's predictions and a linear surrogate model. The study evaluates this framework on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that a high linearity score indicates strong linear alignment but does not always guarantee predictive accuracy. This highlights the potential and limitations of using linear models to interpret the behavior of complex neural networks in regression tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks excel as function approximators, but their complexity often obscures the nature of the functions they learn. In this work, we propose the linearity score $\lambda(f)$, a simple and interpretable diagnostic that quantifies how well a regression network's output can be mimicked by a linear model. Defined as the $R^2$ between the network's predictions and those of a trained linear surrogate, $\lambda(f)$ offers insight into the linear decodability of the learned function. We evaluate this framework on both synthetic ($y = x \sin(x) + \epsilon$) and real-world datasets (Medical Insurance, Concrete, California Housing), using dataset-specific networks and surrogates. Our findings show that while high $\lambda(f)$ scores indicate strong linear alignment, they do not necessarily imply predictive accuracy with respect to the ground truth. This underscores both the promise and the limitations of using linear surrogates to understand nonlinear model behavior, particularly in high-stakes regression tasks.

Summary:
In a new study, researchers compare discriminative and generative classifiers in the context of modern architectures such as Auto-regressive modeling, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification. The research explores how different architectures perform in terms of accuracy, sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and ordinality across various scenarios. The study reveals that there are distinct trade-offs between generative and discriminative classifiers, with generative models exhibiting lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic error in certain cases. The findings provide practical guidance for selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints such as latency and data limitations. Overall, the research delves into the performance differences and practical implications of different modeling approaches in the transformer era.

Abstract: The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification. Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints such as latency and data limitations.

<div> Variational autoencoder, semi-supervised learning, graph neural network, manifold hypothesis, statistical generalization<br />
<br />Summary: <br />The article introduces a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Data is represented as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold and approximated using a variational autoencoder (VAE). A geometric graph is constructed based on the embeddings obtained from the VAE, transforming the classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. The study includes a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this pipeline, showing that the generalization gap diminishes with increasing graph size. It also demonstrates that resampling a slightly larger graph during training can further reduce the generalization gap. Numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <div>

Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.

<div> Algorithm, Continuous-time data generation, Stochastic differential equations, Trajectory inference, Privacy guarantees

Summary:
The provided algorithm focuses on generating continuous-time data, particularly useful in sensitive domains like healthcare. By utilizing trajectory inference and mean-field Langevin dynamics, the algorithm ensures privacy while generating realistic trajectories. Notably, it offers improved privacy guarantees as individuals only need to contribute data for one time point, unlike previous methods that required their entire temporal trajectory. The computational method based on mean-field Langevin dynamics, equivalent to noisy particle gradient descent, allows for applying differential privacy results for noisy SGD to the continuous-time data generation. Experiments conducted on a synthesized version of hand-drawn MNIST data demonstrated the algorithm's effectiveness in generating realistic trajectories while maintaining privacy. Overall, the algorithm provides strong utility guarantees and privacy characteristics, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring the generation of continuous-time data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm to privately generate continuous-time data (e.g. marginals from stochastic differential equations), which has applications in highly sensitive domains involving time-series data such as healthcare. We leverage the connections between trajectory inference and continuous-time synthetic data generation, along with a computational method based on mean-field Langevin dynamics. As discretized mean-field Langevin dynamics and noisy particle gradient descent are equivalent, DP results for noisy SGD can be applied to our setting. We provide experiments that generate realistic trajectories on a synthesized variation of hand-drawn MNIST data while maintaining meaningful privacy guarantees. Crucially, our method has strong utility guarantees under the setting where each person contributes data for \emph{only one time point}, while prior methods require each person to contribute their \emph{entire temporal trajectory}--directly improving the privacy characteristics by construction.

Summary: 
Conventional operating system scheduling algorithms lack context awareness, leading to inefficient task prioritization. This paper introduces semantic scheduling, leveraging language models for intelligent task prioritization based on process semantics. A new scheduling algorithm with optimal time complexity is proposed, focusing on minimizing waiting time in scheduling requests from large language models. The potential benefits of semantic scheduling are demonstrated through a medical emergency management application, highlighting its utility in critical, time-sensitive tasks. The research provides a novel approach to enhancing scheduling algorithms by incorporating semantic analysis, making scheduling decisions more context-aware and efficient. <div>
arXiv:2506.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional operating system scheduling algorithms are largely content-ignorant, making decisions based on factors such as latency or fairness without considering the actual intents or semantics of processes. Consequently, these algorithms often do not prioritize tasks that require urgent attention or carry higher importance, such as in emergency management scenarios. However, recent advances in language models enable semantic analysis of processes, allowing for more intelligent and context-aware scheduling decisions. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic scheduling in scheduling of requests from large language models (LLM), where the semantics of the process guide the scheduling priorities. We present a novel scheduling algorithm with optimal time complexity, designed to minimize the overall waiting time in LLM-based prompt scheduling. To illustrate its effectiveness, we present a medical emergency management application, underscoring the potential benefits of semantic scheduling for critical, time-sensitive tasks.

<div> Federated Learning, LoRA-based fine-tuning, Heterogeneous resources, Local training strategy, HLA strategies

Summary: 
The article introduces Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that allows clients to collaboratively fine-tune foundation models with different local trainable LoRA layers. The framework addresses the issue of heterogeneous resources among clients by developing HLA strategies to adaptively allocate local trainable LoRA layers based on clients' capabilities and the importance of layers. Two main HLA strategies are proposed: one based on dynamic layer importance utilizing Fisher Information Matrix scores, and another focusing on the intrinsic importance of LoRA layers through geometrically-defined patterns. A randomized version of the geometrically-defined strategy is also introduced for enhanced model accuracy with randomness. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Fed-HeLLo with HLA strategies in various federated LoRA fine-tuning settings, including different levels of data distribution from IID to extreme Non-IID.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning has recently been utilized to collaboratively fine-tune foundation models across multiple clients. Notably, federated low-rank adaptation LoRA-based fine-tuning methods have recently gained attention, which allows clients to fine-tune FMs with a small portion of trainable parameters locally. However, most existing methods do not account for the heterogeneous resources of clients or lack an effective local training strategy to maximize global fine-tuning performance under limited resources. In this work, we propose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that enables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local trainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several heterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local trainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer importance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a Fisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm information. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the intrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA strategy. It shapes the collective distribution of trainable LoRA layers into specific geometric patterns, such as Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Bottleneck, and Uniform. Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named Randomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with randomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both the dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy. We evaluate our approach on five datasets under diverse federated LoRA fine-tuning settings, covering three levels of data distribution from IID to extreme Non-IID. Results show that Fed-HeLLo with HLA strategies is both effective and efficient.

<div> emergence, self-reflection, large language model, reinforcement learning, reasoning

Summary:
Self-reflection, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to revisit, evaluate, and revise their own reasoning, has been shown to improve reasoning accuracy. This behavior is not exclusive to models trained with reinforcement learning, as pretrained models also exhibit self-reflection, although rarely. By introducing a method called Reflection-Inducing Probing, researchers were able to increase the frequency of self-reflection in pretrained models significantly. Internal representations in both pretrained and fine-tuned models show distinct hidden states that differentiate self-reflective from non-reflective contexts. A self-reflection vector was constructed, enabling bidirectional control over self-reflective behavior in models. Manipulating this vector improved reasoning performance by up to 12% and allowed for the adjustment of the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without additional training. This study enhances our understanding of self-reflection mechanisms in LLMs and demonstrates the potential for precise behavioral control through the manipulation of internal model representations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-reflection -- the ability of a large language model (LLM) to revisit, evaluate, and revise its own reasoning -- has recently emerged as a powerful behavior enabled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). While self-reflection correlates with improved reasoning accuracy, its origin and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, {\it we first show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent ability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects reflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained models. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from 0.6\% to 18.6\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our analysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned models maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from non-reflective contexts. Leveraging this observation, {\it we then construct a self-reflection vector, a direction in activation space associated with self-reflective reasoning}. By manipulating this vector, we enable bidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and fine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that enhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\%, while suppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to navigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without requiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of self-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding model internals can enable precise behavioral control.

Summary: 
This paper addresses the challenge posed by the quadratic complexity of self-attention in transformers, hindering effective scaling to long input sequences. It suggests that utilizing small transformers optimized for processing short input sequences could efficiently simulate large transformers handling long sequences. The study proves that any transformer with input length N can be simulated by O((N/M)^2) small transformers with input length M, and in scenarios like average-case inputs, sliding window masking, and attention sinks, the optimal number of small transformers needed is O(N/M). Additionally, it establishes that this optimal efficiency cannot be improved in the worst case. This approach offers a potential solution for effectively handling long input sequences in transformers by leveraging the processing efficiency of small transformers.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention prevents transformers from scaling effectively to long input sequences. On the other hand, modern GPUs and other specialized hardware accelerators are well-optimized for processing small input sequences in transformers during both training and inference. A natural question arises: can we take advantage of the efficiency of small transformers to deal with long input sequences?
  In this paper, we show that transformers with long input sequences (large transformers) can be efficiently simulated by transformers that can only take short input sequences (small transformers). Specifically, we prove that any transformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only $O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \ll N$, and that this cannot be improved in the worst case. However, we then prove that in various natural scenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention sinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice.

Summary:<br />
This thesis explores incorporating causality into machine learning to improve tasks such as Out-of-Distribution generalization. By leveraging the principle of independent causal mechanisms, which states that causal mechanisms do not influence each other, the study applies causality to graphs, a common data structure in various industries. Learning causality enhances machine learning's OOD generalization, interpretability, and robustness to adversarial attacks. However, optimizing for causality poses a challenge to traditional ERM objectives. <div>
arXiv:2506.12226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decades, machine learning with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) has demonstrated great capability in learning and exploiting the statistical patterns from data, or even surpassing humans. Despite the success, ERM avoids the modeling of causality the way of understanding and handling changes, which is fundamental to human intelligence. When deploying models beyond the training environment, distribution shifts are everywhere. For example, an autopilot system often needs to deal with new weather conditions that have not been seen during training, An Al-aided drug discovery system needs to predict the biochemical properties of molecules with respect to new viruses such as COVID-19. It renders the problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization challenging to conventional machine learning.
  In this thesis, we investigate how to incorporate and realize the causality for broader tasks in modern machine learning. In particular, we exploit the invariance implied by the principle of independent causal mechanisms (ICM), that is, the causal mechanisms generating the effects from causes do not inform or influence each other. Therefore, the conditional distribution between the target variable given its causes is invariant under distribution shifts. With the causal invariance principle, we first instantiate it to graphs -- a general data structure ubiquitous in many real-world industry and scientific applications, such as financial networks and molecules. Then, we shall see how learning the causality benefits many of the desirable properties of modern machine learning, in terms of (i) OOD generalization capability; (ii) interpretability; and (iii) robustness to adversarial attacks.
  Realizing the causality in machine learning, on the other hand, raises a dilemma for optimization in conventional machine learning, as it often contradicts the objective of ERM...

Summary:
The article introduces a hybrid framework for causal discovery that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with a breadth-first search strategy, active learning, and dynamic scoring. This approach aims to improve the efficiency and robustness of discovering fairness-relevant pathways in complex systems. Using a semi-synthetic benchmark based on the UCI Adult dataset, the framework is evaluated in recovering global structure and fairness-critical paths under noisy conditions. Results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed approach, outperform traditional methods in identifying these pathways. The study also examines the benefits of dynamic scoring and active querying in enhancing the discovery process. The findings have implications for bias auditing in real-world datasets, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing causal relationships in machine learning models. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery (CD) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms underlying complex systems. While recent algorithms can detect spurious associations and latent confounding, many struggle to recover fairness-relevant pathways in realistic, noisy settings. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their access to broad semantic knowledge, offer a promising complement to statistical CD approaches, particularly in domains where metadata provides meaningful relational cues. Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding how sensitive attributes causally influence outcomes, yet CD methods often introduce spurious or biased pathways. We propose a hybrid LLM-based framework for CD that extends a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy with active learning and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for LLM-based querying using a composite score based on mutual information, partial correlation, and LLM confidence, improving discovery efficiency and robustness.
  To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we construct a semi-synthetic benchmark from the UCI Adult dataset, embedding a domain-informed causal graph with injected noise, label corruption, and latent confounding. We assess how well CD methods recover both global structure and fairness-critical paths.
  Our results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed method, demonstrate competitive or superior performance in recovering such pathways under noisy conditions. We highlight when dynamic scoring and active querying are most beneficial and discuss implications for bias auditing in real-world datasets.

arXiv:2506.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly embedded in critical decision-making systems, however their foundational ``black-box'' models require eXplainable AI (XAI) solutions to enhance transparency, which are mostly oriented to experts, making no sense to non-experts. Alarming evidence about AI's unprecedented human values risks brings forward the imperative need for transparent human-centered XAI solutions. In this work, we introduce a domain-, model-, explanation-agnostic, generalizable and reproducible framework that ensures both transparency and human-centered explanations tailored to the needs of both experts and non-experts. The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and employs in-context learning to convey domain- and explainability-relevant contextual knowledge into LLMs. Through its structured prompt and system setting, our framework encapsulates in one response explanations understandable by non-experts and technical information to experts, all grounded in domain and explainability principles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we establish a ground-truth contextual ``thesaurus'' through a rigorous benchmarking with over 40 data, model, and XAI combinations for an explainable clustering analysis of a well-being scenario. Through a comprehensive quality and human-friendliness evaluation of our framework's explanations, we prove high content quality through strong correlations with ground-truth explanations (Spearman rank correlation=0.92) and improved interpretability and human-friendliness to non-experts through a user study (N=56). Our overall evaluation confirms trust in LLMs as HCXAI enablers, as our framework bridges the above Gaps by delivering (i) high-quality technical explanations aligned with foundational XAI methods and (ii) clear, efficient, and interpretable human-centered explanations for non-experts.

Summary:
This article introduces a collaborative recommender system based on machine learning to optimize process parameters for a fleet of networked manufacturing machines. The system addresses the challenge of machine-to-machine variability by modeling the problem as a sequential matrix completion task.

Abstract: Fleets of networked manufacturing machines of the same type, that are collocated or geographically distributed, are growing in popularity. An excellent example is the rise of 3D printing farms, which consist of multiple networked 3D printers operating in parallel, enabling faster production and efficient mass customization. However, optimizing process parameters across a fleet of manufacturing machines, even of the same type, remains a challenge due to machine-to-machine variability. Traditional trial-and-error approaches are inefficient, requiring extensive testing to determine optimal process parameters for an entire fleet. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based collaborative recommender system that optimizes process parameters for each machine in a fleet by modeling the problem as a sequential matrix completion task. Our approach leverages spectral clustering and alternating least squares to iteratively refine parameter predictions, enabling real-time collaboration among the machines in a fleet while minimizing the number of experimental trials. We validate our method using a mini 3D printing farm consisting of ten 3D printers for which we optimize acceleration and speed settings to maximize print quality and productivity. Our approach achieves significantly faster convergence to optimal process parameters compared to non-collaborative matrix completion.

Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks, which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security & privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.

Summary: 
The article discusses the concept of grokking in deep networks, which refers to delayed generalization and emergent robustness to input perturbations during training. It explains how grokking is captured in the Jacobian of a deep network, with the alignment of Jacobians with training data ensuring grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. The proposed GrokAlign method utilizes Jacobian regularization to induce grokking earlier in training compared to traditional regularizers like weight decay. Additionally, centroid alignment simplifies Jacobian alignment, aiding in identifying and tracking different stages of deep network training dynamics. The study provides theoretical insights into optimizing deep networks and highlights the advantages of aligning Jacobians in training dynamics. It also offers practical applications through the introduction of the GrokAlign method and centroid alignment for improved understanding of deep network behaviors. <div>
arXiv:2506.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge for the machine learning community is to understand and accelerate the training dynamics of deep networks that lead to delayed generalisation and emergent robustness to input perturbations, also known as grokking. Prior work has associated phenomena like delayed generalisation with the transition of a deep network from a linear to a feature learning regime, and emergent robustness with changes to the network's functional geometry, in particular the arrangement of the so-called linear regions in deep networks employing continuous piecewise affine nonlinearities. Here, we explain how grokking is realised in the Jacobian of a deep network and demonstrate that aligning a network's Jacobians with the training data (in the sense of cosine similarity) ensures grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. Our results provide a strong theoretical motivation for the use of Jacobian regularisation in optimizing deep networks -- a method we introduce as GrokAlign -- which we show empirically to induce grokking much sooner than more conventional regularizers like weight decay. Moreover, we introduce centroid alignment as a tractable and interpretable simplification of Jacobian alignment that effectively identifies and tracks the stages of deep network training dynamics.

<div> Keywords: Chain-of-thought prompting, large language models, confirmation bias, reasoning generation, answer prediction

Summary:
Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is used to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies across tasks. This study explores CoT behavior through the concept of confirmation bias from cognitive psychology. It investigates how model beliefs impact both reasoning generation ($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By analyzing model beliefs, rationale attributes, and performance, the study uncovers strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, influencing both reasoning and answer prediction processes. The study also discusses task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the impact of belief strength on CoT effectiveness. Overall, the research highlights the importance of developing prompting strategies that counter confirmation bias to improve reasoning performance. The code for the study is available at https://github.com/yuewan2/biasedcot. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- CoT prompting enhances reasoning in LLMs
- Confirmation bias influences reasoning and answer prediction
- Model beliefs skew the reasoning process
- Task vulnerability and belief strength impact CoT effectiveness
- Better prompting strategies needed to mitigate confirmation bias. <div>
arXiv:2506.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation ($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning performance.

<div> diffusion models, generative AI, federated learning, SPIRE, Gaussian mixture models <br />
Summary:
The article introduces SPIRE, a framework that enables on-device personalization and effective federated learning with diffusion models. SPIRE divides the network into a global backbone and client embeddings, allowing for efficient parameter finetuning. The theoretical analysis bridges conditional diffusion training and maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian mixture models, showing the recovery of optimal mixing weights through gradient descent. Empirical results demonstrate SPIRE's superior performance in collaborative pretraining and adaptation to unseen clients, reducing Kernel Inception Distance while updating few parameters. SPIRE also addresses catastrophic forgetting and remains robust across different finetuning settings. <div>
arXiv:2506.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their sheer size makes on device personalization, and thus effective federated learning (FL), infeasible. We propose Shared Backbone Personal Identity Representation Embeddings (SPIRE), a framework that casts per client diffusion based generation as conditional generation in FL. SPIRE factorizes the network into (i) a high capacity global backbone that learns a population level score function and (ii) lightweight, learnable client embeddings that encode local data statistics. This separation enables parameter efficient finetuning that touches $\leq 0.01\%$ of weights. We provide the first theoretical bridge between conditional diffusion training and maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian mixture models. For a two component mixture we prove that gradient descent on the DDPM with respect to mixing weights loss recovers the optimal mixing weights and enjoys dimension free error bounds. Our analysis also hints at how client embeddings act as biases that steer a shared score network toward personalized distributions. Empirically, SPIRE matches or surpasses strong baselines during collaborative pretraining, and vastly outperforms them when adapting to unseen clients, reducing Kernel Inception Distance while updating only hundreds of parameters. SPIRE further mitigates catastrophic forgetting and remains robust across finetuning learning rate and epoch choices.

<div> estimation, conditional potential outcomes, average treatment effects, hidden confounders, randomized controlled trial <br />
Summary: <br />
The article addresses challenges in estimating conditional potential outcomes and average treatment effects (CATE) due to hidden confounders in observational data. It introduces a method using a small dataset from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) along with a pseudo-confounder generator to align potential outcomes from observational data with RCT outcomes. This approach does not assume covariate information for the RCT dataset, making it suitable for scenarios with privacy concerns like medical applications. The method aims to mitigate bias introduced by unobserved confounders and has been validated through extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. <div>
arXiv:2506.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major challenges in estimating conditional potential outcomes and conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is the presence of hidden confounders. Since testing for hidden confounders cannot be accomplished only with observational data, conditional unconfoundedness is commonly assumed in the literature of CATE estimation. Nevertheless, under this assumption, CATE estimation can be significantly biased due to the effects of unobserved confounders. In this work, we consider the case where in addition to a potentially large observational dataset, a small dataset from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is available. Notably, we make no assumptions on the existence of any covariate information for the RCT dataset, we only require the outcomes to be observed. We propose a CATE estimation method based on a pseudo-confounder generator and a CATE model that aligns the learned potential outcomes from the observational data with those observed from the RCT. Our method is applicable to many practical scenarios of interest, particularly those where privacy is a concern (e.g., medical applications). Extensive numerical experiments are provided demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<div> memorization, language models, Pythia, training optimization, data characteristics

Summary:
1. The study focuses on analyzing memorization patterns in the Pythia model family, examining factors like model scale, data characteristics, and perturbations.
2. Larger models display incremental memorization expansion but decreased efficiency as scale increases.
3. The rate of new memorization acquisition decreases with model scale, while old memorization forgetting increases.
4. Data characteristics such as token frequency and repetition count have differential effects on memorized versus non-memorized samples.
5. Prefix perturbations decrease memorization and increase generation uncertainty proportionally to their strength, with low-redundancy samples being more vulnerable. Larger models do not offer additional robustness against perturbations. These findings contribute to understanding memorization mechanisms and have implications for training optimization, privacy protection, and architectural enhancements. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated a remarkable ability for verbatim memorization. While numerous works have explored factors influencing model memorization, the dynamic evolution memorization patterns remains underexplored. This paper presents a detailed analysis of memorization in the Pythia model family across varying scales and training steps under prefix perturbations. Using granular metrics, we examine how model architecture, data characteristics, and perturbations influence these patterns. Our findings reveal that: (1) as model scale increases, memorization expands incrementally while efficiency decreases rapidly; (2) as model scale increases, the rate of new memorization acquisition decreases while old memorization forgetting increases; (3) data characteristics (token frequency, repetition count, and uncertainty) differentially affect memorized versus non-memorized samples; and (4) prefix perturbations reduce memorization and increase generation uncertainty proportionally to perturbation strength, with low-redundancy samples showing higher vulnerability and larger models offering no additional robustness. These findings advance our understanding of memorization mechanisms, with direct implications for training optimization, privacy safeguards, and architectural improvements.

Summary:
Decoupled from manual implementation, a new LLM-friendly Thinking Language (LLM-TL) promotes high-level optimization logic generation and automatic low-level GPU implementation, aiding in understanding and optimizing the attention operator. Using a 2-stage reasoning workflow, TL-Code generation and translation, LLMs can generate FlashAttention implementations across various GPUs, achieving significant performance speed-ups up to 35.16x on A100, RTX8000, and T4 GPUs. Outperforming human-optimized libraries (cuDNN and official library) and supporting unsupported hardware and data types, the method reduces development time drastically from months to minutes, showcasing a self-optimizing paradigm for high-performance attention operators in attention-centric algorithms.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attention operator remains a critical performance bottleneck in large language models (LLMs), particularly for long-context scenarios. While FlashAttention is the most widely used and effective GPU-aware acceleration algorithm, it must require time-consuming and hardware-specific manual implementation, limiting adaptability across GPU architectures. Existing LLMs have shown a lot of promise in code generation tasks, but struggle to generate high-performance attention code. The key challenge is it cannot comprehend the complex data flow and computation process of the attention operator and utilize low-level primitive to exploit GPU performance.
  To address the above challenge, we propose an LLM-friendly Thinking Language (LLM-TL) to help LLMs decouple the generation of high-level optimization logic and low-level implementation on GPU, and enhance LLMs' understanding of attention operator. Along with a 2-stage reasoning workflow, TL-Code generation and translation, the LLMs can automatically generate FlashAttention implementation on diverse GPUs, establishing a self-optimizing paradigm for generating high-performance attention operators in attention-centric algorithms. Verified on A100, RTX8000, and T4 GPUs, the performance of our methods significantly outshines that of vanilla LLMs, achieving a speed-up of up to 35.16x. Besides, our method not only surpasses human-optimized libraries (cuDNN and official library) in most scenarios but also extends support to unsupported hardware and data types, reducing development time from months to minutes compared with human experts.

Summary:
HYPER is proposed as a foundation model for inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs, allowing for prediction of missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities and relations. It can generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and relations, by encoding entities and their positions in hyperedges. The model outperforms existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation inductive settings, displaying strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity relational structures. 16 new inductive datasets were constructed to evaluate HYPER, covering a diverse range of relation types with varying arities. This model shows promising results for inductive link prediction tasks and demonstrates the ability to transfer knowledge across different relation types. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs is the task of predicting missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities (i.e., nodes unseen during training). Existing methods for inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs assume a fixed relational vocabulary and, as a result, cannot generalize to knowledge hypergraphs with novel relation types (i.e., relations unseen during training). Inspired by knowledge graph foundation models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and novel relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation types of varying arities, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16 new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse range of relation types of varying arities. Empirically, HYPER consistently outperforms all existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation inductive settings, showing strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity relational structures.

- Previous research highlighted statistical disparities in intensive care units but lacked causal formalization.
- The study uses a causal inference-based approach to investigate how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements impact clinical decision-making in ICUs.

arXiv:2506.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and measuring biases associated with sensitive attributes is a crucial consideration in healthcare to prevent treatment disparities. One prominent issue is inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, which tend to overestimate oxygen saturation for dark-skinned patients and misrepresent supplemental oxygen needs. Most existing research has revealed statistical disparities linking device errors to patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs) without causal formalization. In contrast, this study causally investigates how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements affect invasive ventilation in ICU settings. We employ a causal inference-based approach using path-specific effects to isolate the impact of bias by race on clinical decision-making. To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust estimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency, and provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on semi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets: MIMIC-IV and eICU. Contrary to prior work, our analysis reveals minimal impact of racial discrepancies on invasive ventilation rates. However, path-specific effects mediated by oxygen saturation disparity are more pronounced on ventilation duration, and the severity differs by dataset. Our work provides a novel and practical pipeline for investigating potential disparities in the ICU and, more crucially, highlights the necessity of causal methods to robustly assess fairness in decision-making.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Secondary Risks, Safety Mechanisms, Evaluation, Benchmarks

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in critical applications, posing challenges in ensuring their safety and alignment with societal functions. While previous research has focused on adversarial attacks, this study introduces the concept of secondary risks, which are non-adversarial failures arising from imperfect generalization during benign interactions. These risks, characterized by harmful or misleading behaviors, can evade standard safety mechanisms. The study presents two risk primitives and a search framework, SecLens, to systematically evaluate secondary risk behaviors. A benchmark dataset, SecRiskBench, comprising 650 prompts across eight real-world risk categories, is also introduced. Experimental results demonstrate that secondary risks are prevalent, transferable across models, and independent of modality. The study highlights the critical need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are tractable representations of probability distributions allowing for exact and efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Recent advancements have improved the scalability of PCs either by leveraging their sparse properties or through the use of tensorized operations for better hardware utilization. However, no existing method fully exploits both aspects simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse and structured parameterization for the sum blocks in PCs. By replacing dense matrices with sparse Monarch matrices, we significantly reduce the memory and computation costs, enabling unprecedented scaling of PCs. From a theory perspective, our construction arises naturally from circuit multiplication; from a practical perspective, compared to previous efforts on scaling up tractable probabilistic models, our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art generative modeling performance on challenging benchmarks like Text8, LM1B and ImageNet, but also demonstrates superior scaling behavior, achieving the same performance with substantially less compute as measured by the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) during training.

<div> Clustering of Bandits, Clustering of Neural Bandits, Selective Reinitialization, plasticity, adaptability<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces the concept of Clustering of Bandits (CB) and Clustering of Neural Bandits (CNB), highlighting their effectiveness in sequential decision-making. However, CNB algorithms face a loss of plasticity over time, hindering their adaptability in dynamic environments. To address this, the proposed Selective Reinitialization (SeRe) framework selectively resets underutilized units to maintain adaptability while preserving stable knowledge retention. By combining SeRe with CNB algorithms, an adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the reinitialization frequency based on non-stationarity, leading to sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary environments. Experimental results on real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate that SeRe-enhanced CNB algorithms outperform traditional approaches by mitigating loss of plasticity and improving adaptability and robustness in dynamic settings. <br />

Abstract: Clustering of Bandits (CB) methods enhance sequential decision-making by grouping bandits into clusters based on similarity and incorporating cluster-level contextual information, demonstrating effectiveness and adaptability in applications like personalized streaming recommendations. However, when extending CB algorithms to their neural version (commonly referred to as Clustering of Neural Bandits, or CNB), they suffer from loss of plasticity, where neural network parameters become rigid and less adaptable over time, limiting their ability to adapt to non-stationary environments (e.g., dynamic user preferences in recommendation). To address this challenge, we propose Selective Reinitialization (SeRe), a novel bandit learning framework that dynamically preserves the adaptability of CNB algorithms in evolving environments. SeRe leverages a contribution utility metric to identify and selectively reset underutilized units, mitigating loss of plasticity while maintaining stable knowledge retention. Furthermore, when combining SeRe with CNB algorithms, the adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the reinitialization frequency according to the degree of non-stationarity, ensuring effective adaptation without unnecessary resets. Theoretically, we prove that SeRe enables sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary environments, outperforming traditional CNB approaches in long-term performances. Extensive experiments on six real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate that SeRe-enhanced CNB algorithms can effectively mitigate the loss of plasticity with lower regrets, improving adaptability and robustness in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced ECG arrhythmia classification, enabling high accuracy in detecting various cardiac conditions. The use of single-lead ECG systems is crucial for portable devices, as they offer convenience and accessibility for continuous monitoring in diverse settings. However, the interpretability and reliability of deep learning models in clinical applications poses challenges due to their black-box nature. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose EXGnet, a single-lead, trustworthy ECG arrhythmia classification network that integrates multiresolution feature extraction with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) guidance and train only quantitative features. Results: Trained on two public datasets, including Chapman and Ningbo, EXGnet demonstrates superior performance through key metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity, and Specificity. The proposed method achieved average five fold accuracy of 98.762%, and 96.932% and average F1-score of 97.910%, and 95.527% on the Chapman and Ningbo datasets, respectively. Conclusions: By employing XAI techniques, specifically Grad-CAM, the model provides visual insights into the relevant ECG segments it analyzes, thereby enhancing clinician trust in its predictions. While quantitative features further improve classification performance, they are not required during testing, making the model suitable for real-world applications. Overall, EXGnet not only achieves better classification accuracy but also addresses the critical need for interpretability in deep learning, facilitating broader adoption in portable ECG monitoring.

<title>PROTOCOL: Partial Optimal Transport-enhanced Contrastive Learning for Imbalanced Multi-view Clustering</title>

Abstract: While contrastive multi-view clustering has achieved remarkable success, it implicitly assumes balanced class distribution. However, real-world multi-view data primarily exhibits class imbalance distribution. Consequently, existing methods suffer performance degradation due to their inability to perceive and model such imbalance. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic study of imbalanced multi-view clustering, focusing on two fundamental problems: i. perceiving class imbalance distribution, and ii. mitigating representation degradation of minority samples. We propose PROTOCOL, a novel PaRtial Optimal TranspOrt-enhanced COntrastive Learning framework for imbalanced multi-view clustering. First, for class imbalance perception, we map multi-view features into a consensus space and reformulate the imbalanced clustering as a partial optimal transport (POT) problem, augmented with progressive mass constraints and weighted KL divergence for class distributions. Second, we develop a POT-enhanced class-rebalanced contrastive learning at both feature and class levels, incorporating logit adjustment and class-sensitive learning to enhance minority sample representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PROTOCOL significantly improves clustering performance on imbalanced multi-view data, filling a critical research gap in this field.

<title>Cross-Domain Conditional Diffusion Models for Time Series Imputation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12412</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain time series imputation is an underexplored data-centric research task that presents significant challenges, particularly when the target domain suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics. Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code implementation is available here.

<title>Wireless Channel Identification via Conditional Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: The identification of channel scenarios in wireless systems plays a crucial role in channel modeling, radio fingerprint positioning, and transceiver design. Traditional methods to classify channel scenarios are based on typical statistical characteristics of channels, such as K-factor, path loss, delay spread, etc. However, statistic-based channel identification methods cannot accurately differentiate implicit features induced by dynamic scatterers, thus performing very poorly in identifying similar channel scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel channel scenario identification method, formulating the identification task as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Furthermore, the MAP estimation is reformulated by a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is then approximated and solved by the conditional generative diffusion model. Specifically, we leverage a transformer network to capture hidden channel features in multiple latent noise spaces within the reverse process of the conditional generative diffusion model. These detailed features, which directly affect likelihood functions in MLE, enable highly accurate scenario identification. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs), and random forest-based classifiers, improving the identification accuracy by more than 10%.

<title>Interpretable Causal Representation Learning for Biological Data in the Pathway Space</title>

arXiv:2506.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the impact of genomic and drug perturbations in cellular function is crucial for understanding gene functions and drug effects, ultimately leading to improved therapies. To this end, Causal Representation Learning (CRL) constitutes one of the most promising approaches, as it aims to identify the latent factors that causally govern biological systems, thus facilitating the prediction of the effect of unseen perturbations. Yet, current CRL methods fail in reconciling their principled latent representations with known biological processes, leading to models that are not interpretable. To address this major issue, we present SENA-discrepancy-VAE, a model based on the recently proposed CRL method discrepancy-VAE, that produces representations where each latent factor can be interpreted as the (linear) combination of the activity of a (learned) set of biological processes. To this extent, we present an encoder, SENA-{\delta}, that efficiently compute and map biological processes' activity levels to the latent causal factors. We show that SENA-discrepancy-VAE achieves predictive performances on unseen combinations of interventions that are comparable with its original, non-interpretable counterpart, while inferring causal latent factors that are biologically meaningful.

<title>Merlin: Multi-View Representation Learning for Robust Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Unfixed Missing Rates</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12459</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.12459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) involves predicting future values of multiple interrelated time series. Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models have gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics (global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are pervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data collectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but their distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack robustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning (Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between incomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations in MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge distillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher model to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete observations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations. The latter improves the student model's robustness by learning from positive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with different missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing rates. Therefore, Merlin is capable of effectively enhancing the robustness of existing models against unfixed missing rates while preserving forecasting accuracy. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Merlin.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks but struggle with label noise in real-world data. Existing studies on graph learning with label noise commonly rely on class-dependent label noise, overlooking the complexities of instance-dependent noise and falling short of capturing real-world corruption patterns. We introduce BeGIN (Benchmarking for Graphs with Instance-dependent Noise), a new benchmark that provides realistic graph datasets with various noise types and comprehensively evaluates noise-handling strategies across GNN architectures, noisy label detection, and noise-robust learning. To simulate instance-dependent corruptions, BeGIN introduces algorithmic methods and LLM-based simulations. Our experiments reveal the challenges of instance-dependent noise, particularly LLM-based corruption, and underscore the importance of node-specific parameterization to enhance GNN robustness. By comprehensively evaluating noise-handling strategies, BeGIN provides insights into their effectiveness, efficiency, and key performance factors. We expect that BeGIN will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research on label noise in graphs and fostering the development of robust GNN training methods. The code is available at https://github.com/kimsu55/BeGIN.

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior modeling is fundamental to safe and efficient trajectory prediction, yet remains challenging in complex traffic scenarios. This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that captures human-like decision-making by inferring diverse reward functions, enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability. The learned reward function is utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by the encoder-decoder architecture that combines Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents. Comprehensive evaluations on urban intersections and roundabouts demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms various popular approaches in prediction accuracy but also achieves 2 times higher generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other IRL-based method.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently gained attention in deep learning for their ability to efficiently model long-range dependencies, making them promising candidates for edge-AI applications. In this paper, we analyze the effects of quantization on small-scale SSMs with a focus on reducing memory and computational costs while maintaining task performance. Using the S4D architecture, we first investigate post-training quantization (PTQ) and show that the state matrix A and internal state x are particularly sensitive to quantization. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different quantization techniques applied to the parameters and activations in the S4D architecture. To address the observed performance drop after Post-training Quantization (PTQ), we apply Quantization-aware Training (QAT), significantly improving performance from 40% (PTQ) to 96% on the sequential MNIST benchmark at 8-bit precision. We further demonstrate the potential of QAT in enabling sub-8-bit precisions and evaluate different parameterization schemes for QAT stability. Additionally, we propose a heterogeneous quantization strategy that assigns different precision levels to model components, reducing the overall memory footprint by a factor of 6x without sacrificing performance. Our results provide actionable insights for deploying quantized SSMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed. To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.
  We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.
  Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients, and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40\%, setting a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

Abstract: This paper studies the optimality and complexity of Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy in size-invariant combinatorial semi-bandit problems. Recently, Honda et al. (2023) and Lee et al. (2024) showed that FTPL achieves Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) optimality in standard multi-armed bandit problems with Fr\'{e}chet-type distributions. However, the optimality of FTPL in combinatorial semi-bandit problems remains unclear. In this paper, we consider the regret bound of FTPL with geometric resampling (GR) in size-invariant semi-bandit setting, showing that FTPL respectively achieves $O\left(\sqrt{m^2 d^\frac{1}{\alpha}T}+\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ regret with Fr\'{e}chet distributions, and the best possible regret bound of $O\left(\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ with Pareto distributions in adversarial setting. Furthermore, we extend the conditional geometric resampling (CGR) to size-invariant semi-bandit setting, which reduces the computational complexity from $O(d^2)$ of original GR to $O\left(md\left(\log(d/m)+1\right)\right)$ without sacrificing the regret performance of FTPL.

arXiv:2506.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) entails a variety of approaches for aligning models with human intent to alleviate the burden of reward engineering. However, most previous PbRL work has not investigated the robustness to labeler errors, inevitable with labelers who are non-experts or operate under time constraints. Additionally, PbRL algorithms often target very specific settings (e.g. pairwise ranked preferences or purely offline learning). We introduce Similarity as Reward Alignment (SARA), a simple contrastive framework that is both resilient to noisy labels and adaptable to diverse feedback formats and training paradigms. SARA learns a latent representation of preferred samples and computes rewards as similarities to the learned latent. We demonstrate strong performance compared to baselines on continuous control offline RL benchmarks. We further demonstrate SARA's versatility in applications such as trajectory filtering for downstream tasks, cross-task preference transfer, and reward shaping in online learning.

Abstract: Self-attention scales quadratically with input size, limiting its use for large-scale physical systems. Although sparse attention mechanisms provide a viable alternative, they are primarily designed for regular structures such as text or images, making them inapplicable for irregular geometries. In this work, we present Ball Sparse Attention (BSA), which adapts Native Sparse Attention (NSA) (Yuan et al., 2025) to unordered point sets by imposing regularity using the Ball Tree structure from the Erwin Transformer (Zhdanov et al., 2025). We modify NSA's components to work with ball-based neighborhoods, yielding a global receptive field at sub-quadratic cost. On an airflow pressure prediction task, we achieve accuracy comparable to Full Attention while significantly reducing the theoretical computational complexity. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/britacatalin/bsa.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact "student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger "teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST (arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Adam is known to perform significantly better than Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in language models, a phenomenon for which a number of explanations have been proposed. In this work, we revisit this "optimizer gap" through a series of comprehensively tuned baseline training runs for language modeling with Transformers. We exhaustively study how momentum, gradient clipping, and batch size affect the gap between SGD and Adam. Our empirical findings show that SGD with momentum can actually perform similarly to Adam in small-batch settings, if tuned correctly. We revisit existing explanations for Adam's advantage, including heavy-tailed class imbalance, directional sharpness, and Hessian heterogeneity, which struggle to directly explain this phenomenon. Towards bridging this gap in our understanding, by analyzing our Transformer training runs and simple quadratic settings inspired by the literature, we provide new insights, driven by stochastic differential equation models, into the role of batch size on the training dynamics.

<title>Beyond Laplace and Gaussian: Exploring the Generalized Gaussian Mechanism for Private Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is obtained by randomizing a data analysis algorithm, which necessarily introduces a tradeoff between its utility and privacy. Many DP mechanisms are built upon one of two underlying tools: Laplace and Gaussian additive noise mechanisms. We expand the search space of algorithms by investigating the Generalized Gaussian mechanism, which samples the additive noise term $x$ with probability proportional to $e^{-\frac{| x |}{\sigma}^{\beta} }$ for some $\beta \geq 1$. The Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms are special cases of GG for $\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$, respectively.
  In this work, we prove that all members of the GG family satisfy differential privacy, and provide an extension of an existing numerical accountant (the PRV accountant) for these mechanisms. We show that privacy accounting for the GG Mechanism and its variants is dimension independent, which substantially improves computational costs of privacy accounting.
  We apply the GG mechanism to two canonical tools for private machine learning, PATE and DP-SGD; we show empirically that $\beta$ has a weak relationship with test-accuracy, and that generally $\beta=2$ (Gaussian) is nearly optimal. This provides justification for the widespread adoption of the Gaussian mechanism in DP learning, and can be interpreted as a negative result, that optimizing over $\beta$ does not lead to meaningful improvements in performance.

While current research focuses on assistant tools for ML pipelines to promote fairness within them, we argue that: 1) The significance of properly defined fairness measures remains underestimated; and 2) Fairness research in ML should integrate societal considerations. The reasons include that detecting discrimination is critical due to the widespread deployment of ML systems and that human-AI feedback loops amplify biases, even when only small social and political biases persist.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on knowledge graph tasks such as link prediction. However, interpreting GNN predictions remains a challenging open problem. While many GNN explainability methods have been proposed for node or graph-level tasks, approaches for generating explanations for link predictions in heterogeneous settings are limited. In this paper, we propose RAW-Explainer, a novel framework designed to generate connected, concise, and thus interpretable subgraph explanations for link prediction. Our method leverages the heterogeneous information in knowledge graphs to identify connected subgraphs that serve as patterns of factual explanation via a random walk objective. Unlike existing methods tailored to knowledge graphs, our approach employs a neural network to parameterize the explanation generation process, which significantly speeds up the production of collective explanations. Furthermore, RAW-Explainer is designed to overcome the distribution shift issue when evaluating the quality of an explanatory subgraph which is orders of magnitude smaller than the full graph, by proposing a robust evaluator that generalizes to the subgraph distribution. Extensive quantitative results on real-world knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a balance between explanation quality and computational efficiency.

<title>Are We Really Measuring Progress? Transferring Insights from Evaluating Recommender Systems to Temporal Link Prediction</title>

Abstract: Recent work has questioned the reliability of graph learning benchmarks, citing concerns around task design, methodological rigor, and data suitability. In this extended abstract, we contribute to this discussion by focusing on evaluation strategies in Temporal Link Prediction (TLP). We observe that current evaluation protocols are often affected by one or more of the following issues: (1) inconsistent sampled metrics, (2) reliance on hard negative sampling often introduced as a means to improve robustness, and (3) metrics that implicitly assume equal base probabilities across source nodes by combining predictions. We support these claims through illustrative examples and connections to longstanding concerns in the recommender systems community. Our ongoing work aims to systematically characterize these problems and explore alternatives that can lead to more robust and interpretable evaluation. We conclude with a discussion of potential directions for improving the reliability of TLP benchmarks.

Abstract: We present Sparse Interpolated Mixture-of-Experts (SIMoE) instruction-tuning, an end-to-end algorithm designed to fine-tune a dense pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) into a MoE-style model that possesses capabilities in multiple specialized domains. During instruction-tuning, SIMoE automatically identifies multiple specialized experts under a specified sparsity constraint, with each expert representing a structurally sparse subset of the seed LLM's parameters that correspond to domain-specific knowledge within the data. SIMoE simultaneously learns an input-dependent expert merging strategy via a router network, leveraging rich cross-expert knowledge for superior downstream generalization that surpasses existing baselines. Empirically, SIMoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on common instruction-tuning benchmarks while maintaining an optimal performance-compute trade-off compared to all baselines.

<title>Semivalue-based data valuation is arbitrary and gameable</title>

Abstract: The game-theoretic notion of the semivalue offers a popular framework for credit attribution and data valuation in machine learning. Semivalues have been proposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as determining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or filtering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on the specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar score. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a composition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual instantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this underspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based valuations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can induce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these valuation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial strategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute value among datapoints. Through theoretical constructions and empirical examples, we demonstrate that a bad-faith valuator can manipulate utility specifications to favor preferred datapoints, and that a good-faith valuator is left without principled guidance to justify any particular specification. These vulnerabilities raise ethical and epistemic concerns about the use of semivalues in several applications. We conclude by highlighting the burden of justification that semivalue-based approaches place on modelers and discuss important considerations for identifying appropriate uses.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success, yet its application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by a lack of robustness to environmental uncertainties. To solve this challenge, some robust RL algorithms have been proposed, but most are limited to tabular settings. In this work, we propose Distributionally Robust Soft Actor-Critic (DR-SAC), a novel algorithm designed to enhance the robustness of the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. DR-SAC aims to maximize the expected value with entropy against the worst possible transition model lying in an uncertainty set. A distributionally robust version of the soft policy iteration is derived with a convergence guarantee. For settings where nominal distributions are unknown, such as offline RL, a generative modeling approach is proposed to estimate the required nominal distributions from data. Furthermore, experimental results on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks demonstrate our algorithm achieves up to $9.8$ times the average reward of the SAC baseline under common perturbations. Additionally, compared with existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms, DR-SAC significantly improves computing efficiency and applicability to large-scale problems.

Abstract: Implicit Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HITL-RL) is a methodology that integrates passive human feedback into autonomous agent training while minimizing human workload. However, existing methods often rely on active instruction, requiring participants to teach an agent through unnatural expression or gesture. We introduce NEURO-LOOP, an implicit feedback framework that utilizes the intrinsic human reward system to drive human-agent interaction. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a critical first step in the NEURO-LOOP framework: mapping brain signals to agent performance. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we design a dataset to enable future research using passive Brain-Computer Interfaces for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning. Participants are instructed to observe or guide a reinforcement learning agent in its environment while signals from the prefrontal cortex are collected. We conclude that a relationship between fNIRS data and agent performance exists using classical machine learning techniques. Finally, we highlight the potential that neural interfaces may offer to future applications of human-agent interaction, assistive AI, and adaptive autonomous systems.

Abstract: Many real-world physics and engineering problems arise in geometrically complex domains discretized by meshes for numerical simulations. The nodes of these potentially irregular meshes naturally form point clouds whose limited tractability poses significant challenges for learning mappings via machine learning models. To address this, we introduce a novel and parameter-free encoding scheme that aggregates footprints of points onto grid vertices and yields information-rich grid representations of the topology. Such structured representations are well-suited for standard convolution and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) operations and enable efficient learning of mappings between encoded input-output pairs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we integrate our encoder with a uniquely designed UNet (E-UNet) and benchmark its performance against Fourier- and transformer-based models across diverse 2D and 3D problems where we analyze the performance in terms of predictive accuracy, data efficiency, and noise robustness. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our encoding scheme in various mapping tasks including recovering full point cloud responses from partial observations. Our proposed framework offers a practical alternative to both primitive and computationally intensive encoding schemes; supporting broad adoption in computational science applications involving mesh-based simulations.

<title>TFKAN: Time-Frequency KAN for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting</title>

arXiv:2506.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are highly effective in long-term time series forecasting due to their ability to efficiently represent nonlinear relationships and exhibit local plasticity. However, prior research on KANs has predominantly focused on the time domain, neglecting the potential of the frequency domain. The frequency domain of time series data reveals recurring patterns and periodic behaviors, which complement the temporal information captured in the time domain. To address this gap, we explore the application of KANs in the frequency domain for long-term time series forecasting. By leveraging KANs' adaptive activation functions and their comprehensive representation of signals in the frequency domain, we can more effectively learn global dependencies and periodic patterns. To integrate information from both time and frequency domains, we propose the $\textbf{T}$ime-$\textbf{F}$requency KAN (TFKAN). TFKAN employs a dual-branch architecture that independently processes features from each domain, ensuring that the distinct characteristics of each domain are fully utilized without interference. Additionally, to account for the heterogeneity between domains, we introduce a dimension-adjustment strategy that selectively upscales only in the frequency domain, enhancing efficiency while capturing richer frequency information. Experimental results demonstrate that TFKAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/LcWave/TFKAN.

Abstract: Notification recommendation systems are critical to driving user engagement on professional platforms like LinkedIn. Designing such systems involves integrating heterogeneous signals across domains, capturing temporal dynamics, and optimizing for multiple, often competing, objectives. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex interactions in such environments. In this paper, we present a cross-domain GNN-based system deployed at LinkedIn that unifies user, content, and activity signals into a single, large-scale graph. By training on this cross-domain structure, our model significantly outperforms single-domain baselines on key tasks, including click-through rate (CTR) prediction and professional engagement. We introduce architectural innovations including temporal modeling and multi-task learning, which further enhance performance. Deployed in LinkedIn's notification system, our approach led to a 0.10% lift in weekly active users and a 0.62% improvement in CTR. We detail our graph construction process, model design, training pipeline, and both offline and online evaluations. Our work demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of cross-domain GNNs in real-world, high-impact applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is playing an increasingly important role in fields such as robotic control and autonomous driving. However, the gap between simulation and the real environment remains a major obstacle to the practical deployment of RL. Agents trained in simulators often struggle to maintain performance when transferred to real-world physical environments. In this paper, we propose a latent space based approach to analyze the impact of simulation on real-world policy improvement in model-based settings. As a natural extension of model-based methods, our approach enables an intuitive observation of the challenges faced by model-based methods in sim-to-real transfer. Experiments conducted in the MuJoCo environment evaluate the performance of our method in both measuring and mitigating the sim-to-real gap. The experiments also highlight the various challenges that remain in overcoming the sim-to-real gap, especially for model-based methods.

<title>Free Privacy Protection for Wireless Federated Learning: Enjoy It or Suffer from It?</title>

Abstract: Inherent communication noises have the potential to preserve privacy for wireless federated learning (WFL) but have been overlooked in digital communication systems predominantly using floating-point number standards, e.g., IEEE 754, for data storage and transmission. This is due to the potentially catastrophic consequences of bit errors in floating-point numbers, e.g., on the sign or exponent bits. This paper presents a novel channel-native bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where transmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to collectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The key idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors caused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved by designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only transmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating the need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the catastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the bit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies (\lambda,\epsilon)-R\'enyi DP and does not violate the WFL convergence. Experiments validate privacy and convergence analysis of the proposed mechanism and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art Gaussian mechanisms that are channel-agnostic and add Gaussian noise for privacy protection.

arXiv:2506.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) accelerates training by eliminating the need to wait for stragglers, but its asynchronous nature introduces gradient staleness, where outdated gradients degrade performance. Existing solutions address this issue with gradient buffers, forming a semi-asynchronous framework. However, this approach struggles when buffers accumulate numerous stale gradients, as blindly aggregating all gradients can harm training. To address this, we propose AFBS (Asynchronous FL Buffer Selection), the first algorithm to perform gradient selection within buffers while ensuring privacy protection. Specifically, the client sends the random projection encrypted label distribution matrix before training, and the server performs client clustering based on it. During training, server scores and selects gradients within each cluster based on their informational value, discarding low-value gradients to enhance semi-asynchronous federated learning. Extensive experiments in highly heterogeneous system and data environments demonstrate AFBS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on the most challenging task, CIFAR-100, AFBS improves accuracy by up to 4.8% over the previous best algorithm and reduces the time to reach target accuracy by 75%.

arXiv:2506.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic link prediction remains a central challenge in temporal graph learning, particularly in designing models that are both effective and practical for real-world deployment. Existing approaches often rely on complex neural architectures, which are computationally intensive and difficult to interpret.
  In this work, we build on the strong recurrence-based foundation of the EdgeBank baseline, by supplementing it with inductive capabilities. We do so by leveraging the predictive power of non-learnable signals from two complementary perspectives: historical edge recurrence, as captured by EdgeBank, and global node popularity, as introduced in the PopTrack model. We propose t-CoMem, a lightweight memory module that tracks temporal co-occurrence patterns and neighborhood activity. Building on this, we introduce Base3, an interpolation-based model that fuses EdgeBank, PopTrack, and t-CoMem into a unified scoring framework. This combination effectively bridges local and global temporal dynamics -- repetition, popularity, and context -- without relying on training. Evaluated on the Temporal Graph Benchmark, Base3 achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art deep models, even outperforming them on some datasets. Importantly, it considerably improves on existing baselines' performance under more realistic and challenging negative sampling strategies -- offering a simple yet robust alternative for temporal graph learning.

Abstract: This paper addresses online learning with ``corrupted'' feedback. Our learner is provided with potentially corrupted gradients $\tilde g_t$ instead of the ``true'' gradients $g_t$. We make no assumptions about how the corruptions arise: they could be the result of outliers, mislabeled data, or even malicious interference. We focus on the difficult ``unconstrained'' setting in which our algorithm must maintain low regret with respect to any comparison point $u \in \mathbb{R}^d$. The unconstrained setting is significantly more challenging as existing algorithms suffer extremely high regret even with very tiny amounts of corruption (which is not true in the case of a bounded domain). Our algorithms guarantee regret $ \|u\|G (\sqrt{T} + k) $ when $G \ge \max_t \|g_t\|$ is known, where $k$ is a measure of the total amount of corruption. When $G$ is unknown we incur an extra additive penalty of $(\|u\|^2+G^2) k$.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning often involves representing complex solution fields that exhibit high-frequency features such as sharp transitions, fine-scale oscillations, and localized structures. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have shown promise for continuous function modeling, capturing such high-frequency behavior remains a challenge-especially when modeling multiple solution fields with a shared network. Prior work addressing spectral bias in INRs has primarily focused on single-instance settings, limiting scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose Global Fourier Modulation (GFM), a novel modulation technique that injects high-frequency information at each layer of the INR through Fourier-based reparameterization. This enables compact and accurate representation of multiple solution fields using low-dimensional latent vectors. Building upon GFM, we introduce PDEfuncta, a meta-learning framework designed to learn multi-modal solution fields and support generalization to new tasks. Through empirical studies on diverse scientific problems, we demonstrate that our method not only improves representational quality but also shows potential for forward and inverse inference tasks without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical and practical problem in many real-world applications, especially for industrial scenarios, where load forecasting underpins the intelligent operation of modern systems like clouds, power grids and traffic networks.However, the inherent complexity and dynamics of these systems present significant challenges. Despite advances in methods such as pattern recognition and anti-non-stationarity have led to performance gains, current methods fail to consistently ensure effectiveness across various system scenarios due to the intertwined issues of complex patterns, concept-drift, and few-shot problems. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel scheme centered on fundamental waveform, a.k.a., meta-pattern. Specifically, we develop a unique Meta-pattern Pooling mechanism to purify and maintain meta-patterns, capturing the nuanced nature of system loads. Complementing this, the proposed Echo mechanism adaptively leverages the meta-patterns, enabling a flexible and precise pattern reconstruction. Our Meta-pattern Echo transformer (MetaEformer) seamlessly incorporates these mechanisms with the transformer-based predictor, offering end-to-end efficiency and interpretability of core processes. Demonstrating superior performance across eight benchmarks under three system scenarios, MetaEformer marks a significant advantage in accuracy, with a 37% relative improvement on fifteen state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The long horizon forecasting (LHF) problem has come up in the time series literature for over the last 35 years or so. This review covers aspects of LHF in this period and how deep learning has incorporated variants of trend, seasonality, fourier and wavelet transforms, misspecification bias reduction and bandpass filters while contributing using convolutions, residual connections, sparsity reduction, strided convolutions, attention masks, SSMs, normalization methods, low-rank approximations and gating mechanisms. We highlight time series decomposition techniques, input data preprocessing and dataset windowing schemes that improve performance. Multi-layer perceptron models, recurrent neural network hybrids, self-attention models that improve and/or address the performances of the LHF problem are described, with an emphasis on the feature space construction. Ablation studies are conducted over the ETTm2 dataset in the multivariate and univariate high useful load (HUFL) forecasting contexts, evaluated over the last 4 months of the dataset. The heatmaps of MSE averages per time step over test set series in the horizon show that there is a steady increase in the error proportionate to its length except with xLSTM and Triformer models and motivate LHF as an error propagation problem. The trained models are available here: https://bit.ly/LHFModelZoo

Abstract: Handling regime shifts and non-stationary time series in deep learning systems presents a significant challenge. In the case of online learning, when new information is introduced, it can disrupt previously stored data and alter the model's overall paradigm, especially with non-stationary data sources. Therefore, it is crucial for neural systems to quickly adapt to new paradigms while preserving essential past knowledge relevant to the overall problem. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm for neural networks called \textit{Lyapunov Learning}. This approach leverages the properties of nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems to prepare the model for potential regime shifts. Drawing inspiration from Stuart Kauffman's Adjacent Possible theory, we leverage local unexplored regions of the solution space to enable flexible adaptation. The neural network is designed to operate at the edge of chaos, where the maximum Lyapunov exponent, indicative of a system's sensitivity to small perturbations, evolves around zero over time.
  Our approach demonstrates effective and significant improvements in experiments involving regime shifts in non-stationary systems. In particular, we train a neural network to deal with an abrupt change in Lorenz's chaotic system parameters. The neural network equipped with Lyapunov learning significantly outperforms the regular training, increasing the loss ratio by about $96\%$.

Abstract: We present \textbf{FlowRL}, a novel framework for online reinforcement learning that integrates flow-based policy representation with Wasserstein-2-regularized optimization. We argue that in addition to training signals, enhancing the expressiveness of the policy class is crucial for the performance gains in RL. Flow-based generative models offer such potential, excelling at capturing complex, multimodal action distributions. However, their direct application in online RL is challenging due to a fundamental objective mismatch: standard flow training optimizes for static data imitation, while RL requires value-based policy optimization through a dynamic buffer, leading to difficult optimization landscapes. FlowRL first models policies via a state-dependent velocity field, generating actions through deterministic ODE integration from noise. We derive a constrained policy search objective that jointly maximizes Q through the flow policy while bounding the Wasserstein-2 distance to a behavior-optimal policy implicitly derived from the replay buffer. This formulation effectively aligns the flow optimization with the RL objective, enabling efficient and value-aware policy learning despite the complexity of the policy class. Empirical evaluations on DMControl and Humanoidbench demonstrate that FlowRL achieves competitive performance in online reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Trajectory Optimization (TO) models have achieved remarkable success in offline reinforcement learning. However, their vulnerabilities against backdoor attacks are poorly understood. We find that existing backdoor attacks in reinforcement learning are based on reward manipulation, which are largely ineffective against the TO model due to its inherent sequence modeling nature. Moreover, the complexities introduced by high-dimensional action spaces further compound the challenge of action manipulation. To address these gaps, we propose TrojanTO, the first action-level backdoor attack against TO models. TrojanTO employs alternating training to enhance the connection between triggers and target actions for attack effectiveness. To improve attack stealth, it utilizes precise poisoning via trajectory filtering for normal performance and batch poisoning for trigger consistency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TrojanTO effectively implants backdoor attacks across diverse tasks and attack objectives with a low attack budget (0.3\% of trajectories). Furthermore, TrojanTO exhibits broad applicability to DT, GDT, and DC, underscoring its scalability across diverse TO model architectures.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has traditionally solved black box problems where evaluation is expensive and, therefore, design-evaluation pairs (i.e., observations) are few. Recently, there has been growing interest in applying BO to problems where evaluation is cheaper and, thus, observations are more plentiful. An impediment to scaling BO to many observations, $N$, is the $O(N^3)$ scaling of a na{\"i}ve query of the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. Modern implementations reduce this to $O(N^2)$, but the GP remains a bottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a surrogate that estimates function values and epistemic uncertainty from $K$ nearest-neighbor observations. ENN has $O(N)$ query time and omits hyperparameter fitting, leaving uncertainty uncalibrated. To accommodate the lack of calibration, we employ an acquisition method based on Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between predicted value and uncertainty. Our proposed method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the GP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson sampling acquisition method with our Pareto-based alternative. We demonstrate numerically that TuRBO-ENN can reduce the time to generate proposals by one to two orders of magnitude compared to TuRBO and scales to thousands of observations.

<title>PDCNet: a benchmark and general deep learning framework for activity prediction of peptide-drug conjugates</title>

Abstract: Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) represent a promising therapeutic avenue for human diseases, particularly in cancer treatment. Systematic elucidation of structure-activity relationships (SARs) and accurate prediction of the activity of PDCs are critical for the rational design and optimization of these conjugates. To this end, we carefully design and construct a benchmark PDCs dataset compiled from literature-derived collections and PDCdb database, and then develop PDCNet, the first unified deep learning framework for forecasting the activity of PDCs. The architecture systematically captures the complex factors underlying anticancer decisions of PDCs in real-word scenarios through a multi-level feature fusion framework that collaboratively characterizes and learns the features of peptides, linkers, and payloads. Leveraging a curated PDCs benchmark dataset, comprehensive evaluation results show that PDCNet demonstrates superior predictive capability, with the highest AUC, F1, MCC and BA scores of 0.9213, 0.7656, 0.7071 and 0.8388 for the test set, outperforming eight established traditional machine learning models. Multi-level validations, including 5-fold cross-validation, threshold testing, ablation studies, model interpretability analysis and external independent testing, further confirm the superiority, robustness, and usability of the PDCNet architecture. We anticipate that PDCNet represents a novel paradigm, incorporating both a benchmark dataset and advanced models, which can accelerate the design and discovery of new PDC-based therapeutic agents.

<title>Enhancing Rating-Based Reinforcement Learning to Effectively Leverage Feedback from Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), as it often requires extensive human effort and domain expertise. While RL from human feedback has been successful in aligning agents with human intent, acquiring high-quality feedback is costly and labor-intensive, limiting its scalability. Recent advancements in foundation models present a promising alternative--leveraging AI-generated feedback to reduce reliance on human supervision in reward learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce ERL-VLM, an enhanced rating-based RL method that effectively learns reward functions from AI feedback. Unlike prior methods that rely on pairwise comparisons, ERL-VLM queries large vision-language models (VLMs) for absolute ratings of individual trajectories, enabling more expressive feedback and improved sample efficiency. Additionally, we propose key enhancements to rating-based RL, addressing instability issues caused by data imbalance and noisy labels. Through extensive experiments across both low-level and high-level control tasks, we demonstrate that ERL-VLM significantly outperforms existing VLM-based reward generation methods. Our results demonstrate the potential of AI feedback for scaling RL with minimal human intervention, paving the way for more autonomous and efficient reward learning.

<title>Private List Learnability vs. Online List Learnability</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12856</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.12856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the connection between differential privacy (DP) and online learning in the context of PAC list learning. In this setting, a $k$-list learner outputs a list of $k$ potential predictions for an instance $x$ and incurs a loss if the true label of $x$ is not included in the list. A basic result in the multiclass PAC framework with a finite number of labels states that private learnability is equivalent to online learnability [Alon, Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019); Bun, Livni, and Moran (2020); Jung, Kim, and Tewari (2020)]. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this equivalence does not hold in the context of list learning. Specifically, we prove that, unlike in the multiclass setting, a finite $k$-Littlestone dimensio--a variant of the classical Littlestone dimension that characterizes online $k$-list learnability--is not a sufficient condition for DP $k$-list learnability. However, similar to the multiclass case, we prove that it remains a necessary condition.
  To demonstrate where the equivalence breaks down, we provide an example showing that the class of monotone functions with $k+1$ labels over $\mathbb{N}$ is online $k$-list learnable, but not DP $k$-list learnable. This leads us to introduce a new combinatorial dimension, the \emph{$k$-monotone dimension}, which serves as a generalization of the threshold dimension. Unlike the multiclass setting, where the Littlestone and threshold dimensions are finite together, for $k>1$, the $k$-Littlestone and $k$-monotone dimensions do not exhibit this relationship. We prove that a finite $k$-monotone dimension is another necessary condition for DP $k$-list learnability, alongside finite $k$-Littlestone dimension. Whether the finiteness of both dimensions implies private $k$-list learnability remains an open question.

<title>MaskPro: Linear-Space Probabilistic Learning for Strict (N:M)-Sparsity on Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made inference efficiency a primary bottleneck in the practical deployment. To address this, semi-structured sparsity offers a promising solution by strategically retaining $N$ elements out of every $M$ weights, thereby enabling hardware-friendly acceleration and reduced memory. However, existing (N:M)-compatible approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based layerwise greedy search, which suffers from considerable errors, and gradient-driven combinatorial learning, which incurs prohibitive training costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel linear-space probabilistic framework named MaskPro, which aims to learn a prior categorical distribution for every $M$ consecutive weights and subsequently leverages this distribution to generate the (N:M)-sparsity throughout an $N$-way sampling without replacement. Furthermore, to mitigate the training instability induced by the high variance of policy gradients in the super large combinatorial space, we propose a novel update method by introducing a moving average tracker of loss residuals instead of vanilla loss. Finally, we conduct comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to validate the superior performance of MaskPro, as well as its excellent scalability in memory efficiency and exceptional robustness to data samples. Our code is available at https://github.com/woodenchild95/Maskpro.git.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning task with numerous applications across diverse fields. Popular algorithms such as k-means often struggle with outliers or imbalances, leading to distorted centroids and suboptimal partitions. We introduce K-Sil, a silhouette-guided refinement of the k-means algorithm that weights points based on their silhouette scores, prioritizing well-clustered instances while suppressing borderline or noisy regions. The algorithm emphasizes user-specified silhouette aggregation metrics: macro-, micro-averaged or a combination, through self-tuning weighting schemes, supported by appropriate sampling strategies and scalable approximations. These components ensure computational efficiency and adaptability to diverse dataset geometries. Theoretical guarantees establish centroid convergence, and empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates statistically significant improvements in silhouette scores over k-means and two other instance-weighted k-means variants. These results establish K-Sil as a principled alternative for applications demanding high-quality, well-separated clusters.

<title>Logit Dynamics in Softmax Policy Gradient Methods</title>

Abstract: We analyzes the logit dynamics of softmax policy gradient methods. We derive the exact formula for the L2 norm of the logit update vector: $$ \|\Delta \mathbf{z}\|_2 \propto \sqrt{1-2P_c + C(P)} $$ This equation demonstrates that update magnitudes are determined by the chosen action's probability ($P_c$) and the policy's collision probability ($C(P)$), a measure of concentration inversely related to entropy. Our analysis reveals an inherent self-regulation mechanism where learning vigor is automatically modulated by policy confidence, providing a foundational insight into the stability and convergence of these methods.

<title>Jailbreak Strength and Model Similarity Predict Transferability</title>

Abstract: Jailbreaks pose an imminent threat to ensuring the safety of modern AI systems by enabling users to disable safeguards and elicit unsafe information. Sometimes, jailbreaks discovered for one model incidentally transfer to another model, exposing a fundamental flaw in safeguarding. Unfortunately, there is no principled approach to identify when jailbreaks will transfer from a source model to a target model. In this work, we observe that transfer success from a source model to a target model depends on quantifiable measures of both jailbreak strength with respect to the source model and the contextual representation similarity of the two models. Furthermore, we show transferability can be increased by distilling from the target model into the source model where the only target model responses used to train the source model are those to benign prompts. We show that the distilled source model can act as a surrogate for the target model, yielding more transferable attacks against the target model. These results suggest that the success of jailbreaks is not merely due to exploitation of safety training failing to generalize out-of-distribution, but instead a consequence of a more fundamental flaw in contextual representations computed by models.

arXiv:2506.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) based algorithm is used for simulation of nonlinear 1D and 2D Burgers' type models. This scheme relies on a neural network built to approximate the problem solution and use a trial function that meets the initial data and boundary criteria. First of all, a brief mathematical formulation of the problem and the structure of PINNs, including the neural network architecture, loss construction, and training methodology is described. Finally, the algorithm is demonstrated with five test problems involving variations of the 1D coupled, 2D single and 2D coupled Burgers' models. We compare the PINN-based solutions with exact results to assess accuracy and convergence of the developed algorithm. The results demonstrate that PINNs may faithfully replicate nonlinear PDE solutions and offer competitive performance in terms of inaccuracy and flexibility. This work demonstrates the potential of PINNs as a reliable approach to solving complex time-dependent PDEs.

<title>Complexity Scaling Laws for Neural Models using Combinatorial Optimization</title>

Abstract: Recent work on neural scaling laws demonstrates that model performance scales predictably with compute budget, model size, and dataset size. In this work, we develop scaling laws based on problem complexity. We analyze two fundamental complexity measures: solution space size and representation space size. Using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study, we show that combinatorial optimization promotes smooth cost trends, and therefore meaningful scaling laws can be obtained even in the absence of an interpretable loss. We then show that suboptimality grows predictably for fixed-size models when scaling the number of TSP nodes or spatial dimensions, independent of whether the model was trained with reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on a static dataset. We conclude with an analogy to problem complexity scaling in local search, showing that a much simpler gradient descent of the cost landscape produces similar trends.

Abstract: Risk stratification is a key tool in clinical decision-making, yet current approaches often fail to translate sophisticated survival analysis into actionable clinical criteria. We present a novel method for unsupervised machine learning that directly optimizes for survival heterogeneity across patient clusters through a differentiable adaptation of the multivariate logrank statistic. Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the methods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable advancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel prognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable results that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical decision-making in oncology and beyond.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated new possibilities for accurate and efficient time series analysis, but prior work often required heavy fine-tuning and/or ignored inter-series correlations. In this work, we explore simple and flexible prompt-based strategies that enable LLMs to perform time series forecasting without extensive retraining or the use of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own method, PatchInstruct, which enables LLMs to make precise and effective predictions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across disciplines due to their advanced reasoning and problem solving capabilities. To measure their effectiveness, various benchmarks have been developed that measure aspects of LLM reasoning, comprehension, and problem-solving. While several surveys address LLM evaluation and benchmarks, a domain-specific analysis remains underexplored in the literature. This paper introduces a taxonomy of seven key disciplines, encompassing various domains and application areas where LLMs are extensively utilized. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM benchmarks and survey papers within each domain, highlighting the unique capabilities of LLMs and the challenges faced in their application. Finally, we compile and categorize these benchmarks by domain to create an accessible resource for researchers, aiming to pave the way for advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI)

Abstract: Randomness is an unavoidable part of training deep learning models, yet something that traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to rigorously account for. They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing distributional training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon the dataset. We demonstrate the practical significance of d-TDA in experiments, e.g. by identifying training examples that drastically change the distribution of some target measurement without necessarily changing the mean. Intriguingly, we also find that influence functions (IFs), a popular but poorly-understood data attribution tool, emerge naturally from our distributional framework as the limit to unrolled differentiation; without requiring restrictive convexity assumptions. This provides a new mathematical motivation for their efficacy in deep learning, and helps to characterise their limitations.

arXiv:2506.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization, in which one optimization problem is nested inside another, underlies many machine learning applications with a hierarchical structure -- such as meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization. Such applications often involve sensitive training data, raising pressing concerns about individual privacy. Motivated by this, we study differentially private bilevel optimization. We first focus on settings where the outer-level objective is \textit{convex}, and provide novel upper and lower bounds on the excess risk for both pure and approximate differential privacy, covering both empirical and population-level loss. These bounds are nearly tight and essentially match the optimal rates for standard single-level differentially private ERM and stochastic convex optimization (SCO), up to additional terms that capture the intrinsic complexity of the nested bilevel structure. The bounds are achieved in polynomial time via efficient implementations of the exponential and regularized exponential mechanisms. A key technical contribution is a new method and analysis of log-concave sampling under inexact function evaluations, which may be of independent interest. In the \textit{non-convex} setting, we develop novel algorithms with state-of-the-art rates for privately finding approximate stationary points. Notably, our bounds do not depend on the dimension of the inner problem.

Abstract: With the growing prominence of antibody-based therapeutics, antibody engineering has gained increasing attention as a critical area of research and development. Recent progress in transformer-based protein large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated promising applications in protein sequence design and structural prediction. Moreover, the availability of large-scale antibody datasets such as the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database has opened new avenues for the development of LLMs specialized for processing antibody sequences. Among these, RoBERTa has demonstrated improved performance relative to BERT, while maintaining a smaller parameter count (125M) compared to the BERT-based protein model, ProtBERT (420M). This reduced model size enables more efficient deployment in antibody-related applications. However, despite the numerous advantages of the RoBERTa architecture, antibody-specific foundational models built upon it have remained inaccessible to the research community. In this study, we introduce Ab-RoBERTa, a RoBERTa-based antibody-specific LLM, which is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/mogam-ai/Ab-RoBERTa. This resource is intended to support a wide range of antibody-related research applications including paratope prediction or humanness assessment.

Abstract: Geometrical interpretations of deep learning models offer insightful perspectives into their underlying mathematical structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages differential geometry, particularly concepts from Riemannian geometry, to integrate multiple models into a unified transfer learning framework. By aligning the Ricci curvature of latent space of individual models, we construct an interrelated architecture, namely Geometric Embedding Alignment via cuRvature matching in transfer learning (GEAR), which ensures comprehensive geometric representation across datapoints. This framework enables the effective aggregation of knowledge from diverse sources, thereby improving performance on target tasks. We evaluate our model on 23 molecular task pairs sourced from various domains and demonstrate significant performance gains over existing benchmark model under both random (14.4%) and scaffold (8.3%) data splits.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models are highly overparameterized, resulting in large sets of parameter configurations that yield the same outputs. A significant portion of this redundancy is explained by symmetries in the parameter space--transformations that leave the network function unchanged. These symmetries shape the loss landscape and constrain learning dynamics, offering a new lens for understanding optimization, generalization, and model complexity that complements existing theory of deep learning. This survey provides an overview of parameter space symmetry. We summarize existing literature, uncover connections between symmetry and learning theory, and identify gaps and opportunities in this emerging field.

Abstract: Sequential recommender systems aim to model users' evolving preferences by capturing patterns in their historical interactions. Recent advances in this area have leveraged deep neural networks and attention mechanisms to effectively represent sequential behaviors and time-sensitive interests. In this work, we propose C-TLSAN (Content-Enhanced Time-Aware Long- and Short-Term Attention Network), an extension of the TLSAN architecture that jointly models long- and short-term user preferences while incorporating semantic content associated with items, such as product descriptions.
  C-TLSAN enriches the recommendation pipeline by embedding textual content linked to users' historical interactions directly into both long-term and short-term attention layers. This allows the model to learn from both behavioral patterns and rich item content, enhancing user and item representations across temporal dimensions. By fusing sequential signals with textual semantics, our approach improves the expressiveness and personalization capacity of recommendation systems.
  We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Amazon datasets, benchmarking C-TLSAN against state-of-the-art baselines, including recent sequential recommenders based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent interaction history and predictions in text form. Empirical results demonstrate that C-TLSAN consistently outperforms strong baselines in next-item prediction tasks. Notably, it improves AUC by 1.66%, Recall@10 by 93.99%, and Precision@10 by 94.80% on average over the best-performing baseline (TLSAN) across 10 Amazon product categories. These results highlight the value of integrating content-aware enhancements into temporal modeling frameworks for sequential recommendation.

Abstract: Time series forecasting underpins vital decision-making across various sectors, yet raw predictions from sophisticated models often harbor systematic errors and biases. We examine the Forecast-Then-Optimize (FTO) framework, pioneering its systematic synopsis. Unlike conventional Predict-Then-Optimize (PTO) methods, FTO explicitly refines forecasts through optimization techniques such as ensemble methods, meta-learners, and uncertainty adjustments. Furthermore, deep learning and large language models have established superiority over traditional parametric forecasting models for most enterprise applications. This paper surveys significant advancements from 2016 to 2025, analyzing mainstream deep learning FTO architectures.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative models, including large language models, multimodal large language models, vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, offering deeper insights into the field.

<title>The Space Complexity of Learning-Unlearning Algorithms</title>

Abstract: We study the memory complexity of machine unlearning algorithms that provide strong data deletion guarantees to the users. Formally, consider an algorithm for a particular learning task that initially receives a training dataset. Then, after learning, it receives data deletion requests from a subset of users (of arbitrary size), and the goal of unlearning is to perform the task as if the learner never received the data of deleted users. In this paper, we ask how many bits of storage are needed to be able to delete certain training samples at a later time. We focus on the task of realizability testing, where the goal is to check whether the remaining training samples are realizable within a given hypothesis class \(\mathcal{H}\).
  Toward that end, we first provide a negative result showing that the VC dimension is not a characterization of the space complexity of unlearning. In particular, we provide a hypothesis class with constant VC dimension (and Littlestone dimension), but for which any unlearning algorithm for realizability testing needs to store \(\Omega(n)\)-bits, where \(n\) denotes the size of the initial training dataset. In fact, we provide a stronger separation by showing that for any hypothesis class \(\mathcal{H}\), the amount of information that the learner needs to store, so as to perform unlearning later, is lower bounded by the \textit{eluder dimension} of \(\mathcal{H}\), a combinatorial notion always larger than the VC dimension. We complement the lower bound with an upper bound in terms of the star number of the underlying hypothesis class, albeit in a stronger ticketed-memory model proposed by Ghazi et al. (2023). Since the star number for a hypothesis class is never larger than its Eluder dimension, our work highlights a fundamental separation between central and ticketed memory models for machine unlearning.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. Reformulating this reverse process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) enables efficient sampling using high-order solvers, often requiring only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ steps. Since the score function is typically approximated by a neural network, analyzing the interaction between its regularity, approximation error, and numerical integration error is key to understanding the overall sampling accuracy. In this work, we continue our analysis of the convergence properties of the deterministic sampling methods derived from probability flow ODEs [25], focusing on $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes for any integer $p \geq 1$. Under the assumption that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function are bounded, we develop $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes and demonstrate that the total variation distance between the target distribution and the generated data distribution can be bounded above by \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}} +d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$ denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data dimension and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum step size used in the solver. We numerically verify the regularity assumption on benchmark datasets, confirming that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function remain bounded in practice. Our theoretical guarantees hold for general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules.

<title>CoIFNet: A Unified Framework for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13064</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a critical task with broad applications in domains such as meteorology, transportation, and economics. Nevertheless, pervasive missing values caused by sensor failures or human errors significantly degrade forecasting accuracy. Prior efforts usually employ an impute-then-forecast paradigm, leading to suboptimal predictions due to error accumulation and misaligned objectives between the two stages. To address this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network (CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion (CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values. Through extensive experiments on challenging MSTF benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed approach across diverse missing-data scenarios, e.g., CoIFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art method by $\underline{\textbf{24.40}}$% ($\underline{\textbf{23.81}}$%) at a point (block) missing rate of 0.6, while improving memory and time efficiency by $\underline{\boldsymbol{4.3\times}}$ and $\underline{\boldsymbol{2.1\times}}$, respectively.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel in graph representation learning by integrating graph structure and node features. Existing GNNs, unfortunately, fail to account for the uncertainty of class probabilities that vary with the depth of the model, leading to unreliable and risky predictions in real-world scenarios. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Evidence Fusing Graph Neural Network (EFGNN for short) to achieve trustworthy prediction, enhance node classification accuracy, and make explicit the risk of wrong predictions. In particular, we integrate the evidence theory with multi-hop propagation-based GNN architecture to quantify the prediction uncertainty of each node with the consideration of multiple receptive fields. Moreover, a parameter-free cumulative belief fusion (CBF) mechanism is developed to leverage the changes in prediction uncertainty and fuse the evidence to improve the trustworthiness of the final prediction. To effectively optimize the EFGNN model, we carefully design a joint learning objective composed of evidence cross-entropy, dissonance coefficient, and false confident penalty. The experimental results on various datasets and theoretical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of accuracy and trustworthiness, as well as its robustness to potential attacks. The source code of EFGNN is available at https://github.com/Shiy-Li/EFGNN.

<title>Fast and Furious Symmetric Learning in Zero-Sum Games: Gradient Descent as Fictitious Play</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the sublinear regret guarantees of two non-no-regret algorithms in zero-sum games: Fictitious Play, and Online Gradient Descent with constant stepsizes. In general adversarial online learning settings, both algorithms may exhibit instability and linear regret due to no regularization (Fictitious Play) or small amounts of regularization (Gradient Descent). However, their ability to obtain tighter regret bounds in two-player zero-sum games is less understood. In this work, we obtain strong new regret guarantees for both algorithms on a class of symmetric zero-sum games that generalize the classic three-strategy Rock-Paper-Scissors to a weighted, n-dimensional regime. Under symmetric initializations of the players' strategies, we prove that Fictitious Play with any tiebreaking rule has $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret, establishing a new class of games for which Karlin's Fictitious Play conjecture holds. Moreover, by leveraging a connection between the geometry of the iterates of Fictitious Play and Gradient Descent in the dual space of payoff vectors, we prove that Gradient Descent, for almost all symmetric initializations, obtains a similar $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when its stepsize is a sufficiently large constant. For Gradient Descent, this establishes the first "fast and furious" behavior (i.e., sublinear regret without time-vanishing stepsizes) for zero-sum games larger than 2x2.

Abstract: Recent research on deep graph learning has shifted from static to dynamic graphs, motivated by the evolving behaviors observed in complex real-world systems. However, the temporal extension in dynamic graphs poses significant data efficiency challenges, including increased data volume, high spatiotemporal redundancy, and reliance on costly dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs). To alleviate the concerns, we pioneer the study of dynamic graph condensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic graphs for data-efficient DGNN training. Accordingly, we propose DyGC, a novel framework that condenses the real dynamic graph into a compact version while faithfully preserving the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics. Specifically, to endow synthetic graphs with realistic evolving structures, a novel spiking structure generation mechanism is introduced. It draws on the dynamic behavior of spiking neurons to model temporally-aware connectivity in dynamic graphs. Given the tightly coupled spatiotemporal dependencies, DyGC proposes a tailored distribution matching approach that first constructs a semantically rich state evolving field for dynamic graphs, and then performs fine-grained spatiotemporal state alignment to guide the optimization of the condensed graph. Experiments across multiple dynamic graph datasets and representative DGNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of DyGC. Notably, our method retains up to 96.2% DGNN performance with only 0.5% of the original graph size, and achieves up to 1846 times training speedup.

<title>Equitable Electronic Health Record Prediction with FAME: Fairness-Aware Multimodal Embedding</title>

Abstract: Electronic Health Record (EHR) data encompass diverse modalities -- text, images, and medical codes -- that are vital for clinical decision-making. To process these complex data, multimodal AI (MAI) has emerged as a powerful approach for fusing such information. However, most existing MAI models optimize for better prediction performance, potentially reinforcing biases across patient subgroups. Although bias-reduction techniques for multimodal models have been proposed, the individual strengths of each modality and their interplay in both reducing bias and optimizing performance remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce FAME (Fairness-Aware Multimodal Embeddings), a framework that explicitly weights each modality according to its fairness contribution. FAME optimizes both performance and fairness by incorporating a combined loss function. We leverage the Error Distribution Disparity Index (EDDI) to measure fairness across subgroups and propose a sign-agnostic aggregation method to balance fairness across subgroups, ensuring equitable model outcomes. We evaluate FAME with BEHRT and BioClinicalBERT, combining structured and unstructured EHR data, and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of performance and fairness compared with other baselines across multiple EHR prediction tasks.

<title>Honesty in Causal Forests: When It Helps and When It Hurts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13107</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal forests are increasingly used to personalize decisions based on estimated treatment effects. A distinctive modeling choice in this method is honest estimation: using separate data for splitting and for estimating effects within leaves. This practice is the default in most implementations and is widely seen as desirable for causal inference. But we show that honesty can hurt the accuracy of individual-level effect estimates. The reason is a classic bias-variance trade-off: honesty reduces variance by preventing overfitting, but increases bias by limiting the model's ability to discover and exploit meaningful heterogeneity in treatment effects. This trade-off depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): honesty helps when effect heterogeneity is hard to detect (low SNR), but hurts when the signal is strong (high SNR). In essence, honesty acts as a form of regularization, and like any regularization choice, it should be guided by out-of-sample performance, not adopted by default.

Abstract: One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under normal conditions.

Abstract: Crime hotspot prediction is critical for ensuring urban safety and effective law enforcement, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatial dependencies inherent in criminal activity. The previous approaches tended to use classical algorithms such as the KDE and SVM to model data distributions and decision boundaries. The methods often fail to capture these spatial relationships, treating crime events as independent and ignoring geographical interactions. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which explicitly model spatial dependencies by representing crime data as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent discrete geographic grid cells and edges capture proximity relationships. Using the Chicago Crime Dataset, we engineer spatial features and train a multi-layer GCN model to classify crime types and predict high-risk zones. Our approach achieves 88% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Additionally, the model generates interpretable heat maps of crime hotspots, demonstrating the practical utility of graph-based learning for predictive policing and spatial criminology.

Abstract: Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant challenge in precision medicine, with important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders. We propose a novel graph-based approach for predicting causative genes from patient phenotypes, with or without an available list of candidate genes, by integrating a rare disease knowledge graph (KG). Our model, combining graph neural networks and transformers, achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\% and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.

Abstract: PDE-Constrained Optimization (PDECO) problems can be accelerated significantly by employing gradient-based methods with surrogate models like neural operators compared to traditional numerical solvers. However, this approach faces two key challenges: (1) **Data inefficiency**: Lack of efficient data sampling and effective training for neural operators, particularly for optimization purpose. (2) **Instability**: High risk of optimization derailment due to inaccurate neural operator predictions and gradients. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework: (1) **Optimization-oriented training**: we leverage data from full steps of traditional optimization algorithms and employ a specialized training method for neural operators. (2) **Enhanced derivative learning**: We introduce a *Virtual-Fourier* layer to enhance derivative learning within the neural operator, a crucial aspect for gradient-based optimization. (3) **Hybrid optimization**: We implement a hybrid approach that integrates neural operators with numerical solvers, providing robust regularization for the optimization process. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in accurately learning operators and their derivatives. Furthermore, our hybrid optimization approach exhibits robust convergence.

Abstract: Data scarcity in African agriculture hampers machine learning (ML) model performance, limiting innovations in precision agriculture. The Synthetic Agriculture Data for Africa (SAGDA) library, a Python-based open-source toolkit, addresses this gap by generating, augmenting, and validating synthetic agricultural datasets. We present SAGDA's design and development practices, highlighting its core functions: generate, model, augment, validate, visualize, optimize, and simulate, as well as their roles in applications of ML for agriculture. Two use cases are detailed: yield prediction enhanced via data augmentation, and multi-objective NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) fertilizer recommendation. We conclude with future plans for expanding SAGDA's capabilities, underscoring the vital role of open-source, data-driven practices for African agriculture.

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems are widely applied to online optimization tasks that require balancing exploration and exploitation. In practical scenarios, these tasks often involve multiple conflicting objectives, giving rise to multi-objective multi-armed bandits (MO-MAB). Existing MO-MAB approaches predominantly rely on the Pareto regret metric introduced in \cite{drugan2013designing}. However, this metric has notable limitations, particularly in accounting for all Pareto-optimal arms simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and comprehensive regret metric that ensures balanced performance across conflicting objectives. Additionally, we introduce the concept of \textit{Efficient Pareto-Optimal} arms, which are specifically designed for online optimization. Based on our new metric, we develop a two-phase MO-MAB algorithm that achieves sublinear regret for both Pareto-optimal and efficient Pareto-optimal arms.

Abstract: ADMM is a popular method for federated deep learning which originated in the 1970s and, even though many new variants of it have been proposed since then, its core algorithmic structure has remained unchanged. Here, we take a major departure from the old structure and present a fundamentally new way to derive and extend federated ADMM. We propose to use a structure called Bayesian Duality which exploits a duality of the posterior distributions obtained by solving a variational-Bayesian reformulation of the original problem. We show that this naturally recovers the original ADMM when isotropic Gaussian posteriors are used, and yields non-trivial extensions for other posterior forms. For instance, full-covariance Gaussians lead to Newton-like variants of ADMM, while diagonal covariances result in a cheap Adam-like variant. This is especially useful to handle heterogeneity in federated deep learning, giving up to 7% accuracy improvements over recent baselines. Our work opens a new Bayesian path to improve primal-dual methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) rely heavily on high-quality open-source datasets (e.g., ImageNet) for their success, making dataset ownership verification (DOV) crucial for protecting public dataset copyrights. In this paper, we find existing DOV methods (implicitly) assume that the verification process is faithful, where the suspicious model will directly verify ownership by using the verification samples as input and returning their results. However, this assumption may not necessarily hold in practice and their performance may degrade sharply when subjected to intentional or unintentional perturbations. To address this limitation, we propose the first certified dataset watermark (i.e., CertDW) and CertDW-based certified dataset ownership verification method that ensures reliable verification even under malicious attacks, under certain conditions (e.g., constrained pixel-level perturbation). Specifically, inspired by conformal prediction, we introduce two statistical measures, including principal probability (PP) and watermark robustness (WR), to assess model prediction stability on benign and watermarked samples under noise perturbations. We prove there exists a provable lower bound between PP and WR, enabling ownership verification when a suspicious model's WR value significantly exceeds the PP values of multiple benign models trained on watermark-free datasets. If the number of PP values smaller than WR exceeds a threshold, the suspicious model is regarded as having been trained on the protected dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our CertDW method and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks. Our codes are at \href{https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/CertDW}{GitHub}.

Abstract: We study the Logistic Contextual Slate Bandit problem, where, at each round, an agent selects a slate of $N$ items from an exponentially large set (of size $2^{\Omega(N)}$) of candidate slates provided by the environment. A single binary reward, determined by a logistic model, is observed for the chosen slate. Our objective is to develop algorithms that maximize cumulative reward over $T$ rounds while maintaining low per-round computational costs. We propose two algorithms, Slate-GLM-OFU and Slate-GLM-TS, that accomplish this goal. These algorithms achieve $N^{O(1)}$ per-round time complexity via local planning (independent slot selections), and low regret through global learning (joint parameter estimation). We provide theoretical and empirical evidence supporting these claims. Under a well-studied diversity assumption, we prove that Slate-GLM-OFU incurs only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Extensive experiments across a wide range of synthetic settings demonstrate that our algorithms consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines, achieving both the lowest regret and the fastest runtime. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to select in-context examples in prompts of Language Models for solving binary classification tasks such as sentiment analysis. Our approach achieves competitive test accuracy, making it a viable alternative in practical scenarios.

Abstract: The pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm has driven significant advances across domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision, with representative pretraining paradigms such as masked language modeling and next-token prediction. However, in molecular representation learning, the task design remains largely limited to node-level denoising, which is effective at modeling local atomic environments, yet maybe insufficient for capturing the global molecular structure required by graph-level property prediction tasks, such as energy estimation and molecular regression. In this work, we present GeoRecon, a novel graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from individual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon introduces a graph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to generate an informative graph representation capable of accurately guiding reconstruction of the molecular geometry. This encourages the model to learn coherent, global structural features rather than isolated atomic details. Without relying on additional supervision or external data, GeoRecon outperforms node-centric baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks (e.g., QM9, MD17), demonstrating the benefit of incorporating graph-level reconstruction for learning more holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings.

Abstract: Conventional low-rank adaptation methods build adapters without considering data context, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning performance and severe forgetting of inherent world knowledge. In this paper, we propose context-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that initializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop context-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance matrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the target task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its corresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is compacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our method enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM) and instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between freezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or adapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by deriving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal components, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank allocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each layer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank allocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a significant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning performance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained knowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM, our method exhibits faster convergence, \emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA, and improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong baseline methods. Our method has been integrated into the PEFT library developed by Hugging Face.

<title>KEPLA: A Knowledge-Enhanced Deep Learning Framework for Accurate Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction</title>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is critical for drug discovery. While recent deep learning approaches have demonstrated promising results, they often rely solely on structural features, overlooking valuable biochemical knowledge associated with binding affinity. To address this limitation, we propose KEPLA, a novel deep learning framework that explicitly integrates prior knowledge from Gene Ontology and ligand properties of proteins and ligands to enhance prediction performance. KEPLA takes protein sequences and ligand molecular graphs as input and optimizes two complementary objectives: (1) aligning global representations with knowledge graph relations to capture domain-specific biochemical insights, and (2) leveraging cross attention between local representations to construct fine-grained joint embeddings for prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that KEPLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, interpretability analyses based on knowledge graph relations and cross attention maps provide valuable insights into the underlying predictive mechanisms.

Abstract: Wearable devices, such as smartwatches and head-mounted displays, are increasingly used for prolonged tasks like remote learning and work, but sustained interaction often leads to user fatigue, reducing efficiency and engagement. This study proposes a fatigue-aware adaptive interface system for wearable devices that leverages deep learning to analyze physiological data (e.g., heart rate, eye movement) and dynamically adjust interface elements to mitigate cognitive load. The system employs multimodal learning to process physiological and contextual inputs and reinforcement learning to optimize interface features like text size, notification frequency, and visual contrast. Experimental results show a 18% reduction in cognitive load and a 22% improvement in user satisfaction compared to static interfaces, particularly for users engaged in prolonged tasks. This approach enhances accessibility and usability in wearable computing environments.

<title>Thought Crime: Backdoors and Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13206</link>

arXiv:2506.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick the user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.
  Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes broad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find that reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable.
  In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.

Abstract: We propose Polyra Swarms, a novel machine-learning approach that approximates shapes instead of functions. Our method enables general-purpose learning with very low bias. In particular, we show that depending on the task, Polyra Swarms can be preferable compared to neural networks, especially for tasks like anomaly detection. We further introduce an automated abstraction mechanism that simplifies the complexity of a Polyra Swarm significantly, enhancing both their generalization and transparency. Since Polyra Swarms operate on fundamentally different principles than neural networks, they open up new research directions with distinct strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Neural network training is inherently sensitive to initialization and the randomness induced by stochastic gradient descent. However, it is unclear to what extent such effects lead to meaningfully different networks, either in terms of the models' weights or the underlying functions that were learned. In this work, we show that during the initial "chaotic" phase of training, even extremely small perturbations reliably causes otherwise identical training trajectories to diverge-an effect that diminishes rapidly over training time. We quantify this divergence through (i) $L^2$ distance between parameters, (ii) the loss barrier when interpolating between networks, (iii) $L^2$ and barrier between parameters after permutation alignment, and (iv) representational similarity between intermediate activations; revealing how perturbations across different hyperparameter or fine-tuning settings drive training trajectories toward distinct loss minima. Our findings provide insights into neural network training stability, with practical implications for fine-tuning, model merging, and diversity of model ensembles.

<title>Lightweight Task-Oriented Semantic Communication Empowered by Large-Scale AI Models</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have focused on leveraging large-scale artificial intelligence (LAI) models to improve semantic representation and compression capabilities. However, the substantial computational demands of LAI models pose significant challenges for real-time communication scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes utilizing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to extract and condense knowledge from LAI models, effectively reducing model complexity and computation latency. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of LAI models leads to prolonged inference times during distillation, while their lack of channel awareness compromises the distillation performance. These limitations make standard KD methods unsuitable for task-oriented semantic communication scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a fast distillation method featuring a pre-stored compression mechanism that eliminates the need for repetitive inference, significantly improving efficiency. Furthermore, a channel adaptive module is incorporated to dynamically adjust the transmitted semantic information based on varying channel conditions, enhancing communication reliability and adaptability. In addition, an information bottleneck-based loss function is derived to guide the fast distillation process. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperform baselines in term of task accuracy, model size, computation latency, and training data requirements.

<title>No-Regret Learning Under Adversarial Resource Constraints: A Spending Plan Is All You Need!</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13244</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online decision making problems under resource constraints, where both reward and cost functions are drawn from distributions that may change adversarially over time. We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution of the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our methods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly imbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing against benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) research often considers learning a function in-context through a uniform sample of input-output pairs. Here, we investigate how presenting a compositional subtask curriculum in context may alter the computations a transformer learns. We design a compositional algorithmic task based on the modular exponential-a double exponential task composed of two single exponential subtasks and train transformer models to learn the task in-context. We compare (a) models trained using an in-context curriculum consisting of single exponential subtasks and, (b) models trained directly on the double exponential task without such a curriculum. We show that models trained with a subtask curriculum can perform zero-shot inference on unseen compositional tasks and are more robust given the same context length. We study how the task and subtasks are represented across the two training regimes. We find that the models employ diverse strategies modulated by the specific curriculum design.

<title>An Explainable and Interpretable Composite Indicator Based on Decision Rules</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13259</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13259</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite indicators are widely used to score or classify units evaluated on multiple criteria. Their construction involves aggregating criteria evaluations, a common practice in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). In MCDA, various methods have been proposed to address key aspects of multiple criteria evaluations, such as the measurement scales of the criteria, the degree of acceptable compensation between them, and their potential interactions. However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is essential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well as the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing explainable and interpretable composite indicators using "if..., then..." decision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of composite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical scores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal qualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into quantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in the form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is constructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units results from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision rules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach. The resulting decision rules relate the class assignment or unit's score to threshold conditions on values of selected indicators in an intelligible way, clarifying the underlying rationale. Moreover, they serve to recommend composite indicator assessment for new units of interest.

Abstract: Learning rate is widely regarded as crucial for effective foundation model pretraining. Recent research explores and demonstrates the transferability of learning rate configurations across varying model and dataset sizes, etc. Nevertheless, these approaches are constrained to specific training scenarios and typically necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on proxy models. In this work, we propose \textbf{AdaLRS}, a plug-in-and-play adaptive learning rate search algorithm that conducts online optimal learning rate search via optimizing loss descent velocities. We provide experiment results to show that the optimization of training loss and loss descent velocity in foundation model pretraining are both convex and share the same optimal learning rate. Relying solely on training loss dynamics, AdaLRS involves few extra computations to guide the search process, and its convergence is guaranteed via theoretical analysis. Experiments on both LLM and VLM pretraining show that AdaLRS adjusts suboptimal learning rates to the neighborhood of optimum with marked efficiency and effectiveness, with model performance improved accordingly. We also show the robust generalizability of AdaLRS across varying training scenarios, such as different model sizes, training paradigms, and base learning rate scheduler choices.

<title>SeqPE: Transformer with Sequential Position Encoding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities, underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding framework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual architectural redesign. We release our code, data, and checkpoints at https://github.com/ghrua/seqpe.

Abstract: Vine copulas are sophisticated models for multivariate distributions and are increasingly used in machine learning. To facilitate their integration into modern ML pipelines, we introduce the vine computational graph, a DAG that abstracts the multilevel vine structure and associated computations. On this foundation, we devise new algorithms for conditional sampling, efficient sampling-order scheduling, and constructing vine structures for customized conditioning variables. We implement these ideas in torchvinecopulib, a GPU-accelerated Python library built upon PyTorch, delivering improved scalability for fitting, sampling, and density evaluation. Our experiments illustrate how gradient flowing through the vine can improve Vine Copula Autoencoders and that incorporating vines for uncertainty quantification in deep learning can outperform MC-dropout, deep ensembles, and Bayesian Neural Networks in sharpness, calibration, and runtime. By recasting vine copula models as computational graphs, our work connects classical dependence modeling with modern deep-learning toolchains and facilitates the integration of state-of-the-art copula methods in modern machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Human intelligence emerges from the interaction of specialized brain networks, each dedicated to distinct cognitive functions such as language processing, logical reasoning, social understanding, and memory retrieval. Inspired by this biological observation, we introduce the Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo) architecture and training paradigm: a modular transformer-based language model with a training curriculum that encourages the emergence of functional specialization among different modules. Inspired by studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks. And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance, and controllability.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks. We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs) to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust tool for various downstream biological applications.

<title>Learning to Explore in Diverse Reward Settings via Temporal-Difference-Error Maximization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous heuristics and advanced approaches have been proposed for exploration in different settings for deep reinforcement learning. Noise-based exploration generally fares well with dense-shaped rewards and bonus-based exploration with sparse rewards. However, these methods usually require additional tuning to deal with undesirable reward settings by adjusting hyperparameters and noise distributions. Rewards that actively discourage exploration, i.e., with an action cost and no other dense signal to follow, can pose a major challenge. We propose a novel exploration method, Stable Error-seeking Exploration (SEE), that is robust across dense, sparse, and exploration-adverse reward settings. To this endeavor, we revisit the idea of maximizing the TD-error as a separate objective. Our method introduces three design choices to mitigate instability caused by far-off-policy learning, the conflict of interest of maximizing the cumulative TD-error in an episodic setting, and the non-stationary nature of TD-errors. SEE can be combined with off-policy algorithms without modifying the optimization pipeline of the original objective. In our experimental analysis, we show that a Soft-Actor Critic agent with the addition of SEE performs robustly across three diverse reward settings in a variety of tasks without hyperparameter adjustments.

Abstract: We propose two new methods based/inspired by machine learning for tabular data and distance-free localization to enhance the covariance estimations in an ensemble data assimilation. The main goal is to enhance the data assimilation results by mitigating loss of variance due to sampling errors. We also analyze the suitability of several machine learning models and the balance between accuracy and computational cost of the covariance estimations. We introduce two distance-free localization techniques leveraging machine learning methods specifically tailored for tabular data. The methods are integrated into the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework. The results show that the proposed localizations improve covariance accuracy and enhance data assimilation and uncertainty quantification results. We observe reduced variance loss for the input variables using the proposed methods. Furthermore, we compare several machine learning models, assessing their suitability for the problem in terms of computational cost, and quality of the covariance estimation and data match. The influence of ensemble size is also investigated, providing insights into balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that certain machine learning models are more suitable for this problem. This study introduces two novel methods that mitigate variance loss for model parameters in ensemble-based data assimilation, offering practical solutions that are easy to implement and do not require any additional numerical simulation or hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Intra-cortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) present a promising solution to restoring and decoding brain activity lost due to injury. However, patients with such neuroprosthetics suffer from permanent skull openings resulting from the devices' bulky wiring. This drives the development of wireless iBMIs, which demand low power consumption and small device footprint. Most recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been researched as potential candidates for low-power neural decoding. In this work, we present the next step of utilizing SNNs for such tasks, building on the recently published results of the 2024 Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding Challenge for Motor Control of non-Human Primates. We optimize our model architecture to exceed the existing state of the art on the Primate Reaching dataset while maintaining similar resource demand through various compression techniques. We further focus on implementing a realtime-capable version of the model and discuss the implications of this architecture. With this, we advance one step towards latency-free decoding of cortical spike trains using neuromorphic technology, ultimately improving the lives of millions of paralyzed patients.

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate the strengths of multiple fine-tuned models into a unified model while preserving task-specific capabilities. Existing methods, represented by task arithmetic, are typically classified into global- and local-aware methods. However, global-aware methods inevitably cause parameter interference, while local-aware methods struggle to maintain the effectiveness of task-specific details in the merged model. To address these limitations, we propose a Consensus-Aware Localized Merging (CALM) method which incorporates localized information aligned with global task consensus, ensuring its effectiveness post-merging. CALM consists of three key components: (1) class-balanced entropy minimization sampling, providing a more flexible and reliable way to leverage unsupervised data; (2) an efficient-aware framework, selecting a small set of tasks for sequential merging with high scalability; (3) a consensus-aware mask optimization, aligning localized binary masks with global task consensus and merging them conflict-free. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our CALM, significantly outperforming existing methods and achieving performance close to traditional MTL.

arXiv:2506.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high computational complexity and increasing parameter counts of deep neural networks pose significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or real-time systems. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient neural architecture where neurons are embedded in Euclidean space. During training, their positions are optimized and synaptic weights are determined as the inverse of the spatial distance between connected neurons. These distance-dependent wiring rules replace traditional learnable weight matrices and significantly reduce the number of parameters while introducing a biologically inspired inductive bias: connection strength decreases with spatial distance, reflecting the brain's embedding in three-dimensional space where connections tend to minimize wiring length. We validate this approach for both multi-layer perceptrons and spiking neural networks. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that these spatially embedded neural networks achieve a performance competitive with conventional architectures on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, the models maintain performance even at pruning rates exceeding 80% sparsity, outperforming traditional networks with the same number of parameters under similar conditions. Finally, the spatial embedding framework offers an intuitive visualization of the network structure.

Abstract: Advancements in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors enable sophisticated Predictive Maintenance (PM) with high temporal resolution. For cost-efficient solutions, vibration-based condition monitoring is especially of interest. However, analyzing high-resolution vibration data via traditional cloud approaches incurs significant energy and communication costs, hindering battery-powered edge deployments. This necessitates shifting intelligence to the sensor edge. Due to their event-driven nature, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising pathway toward energy-efficient on-device processing. This paper investigates a recurrent SNN for simultaneous regression (flow, pressure, pump speed) and multi-label classification (normal, overpressure, cavitation) for an industrial progressing cavity pump (PCP) using 3-axis vibration data. Furthermore, we provide energy consumption estimates comparing the SNN approach on conventional (x86, ARM) and neuromorphic (Loihi) hardware platforms. Results demonstrate high classification accuracy (>97%) with zero False Negative Rates for critical Overpressure and Cavitation faults. Smoothed regression outputs achieve Mean Relative Percentage Errors below 1% for flow and pump speed, approaching industrial sensor standards, although pressure prediction requires further refinement. Energy estimates indicate significant power savings, with the Loihi consumption (0.0032 J/inf) being up to 3 orders of magnitude less compared to the estimated x86 CPU (11.3 J/inf) and ARM CPU (1.18 J/inf) execution. Our findings underscore the potential of SNNs for multi-task PM directly on resource-constrained edge devices, enabling scalable and energy-efficient industrial monitoring solutions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been shown to achieve exceptional performance for computer vision tasks like image recognition, segmentation, and reconstruction or denoising. Here, we evaluate the ultimate performance limits of deep convolutional neural network models for image reconstruction, by comparing them against the standard quantum limit set by shot-noise and the Heisenberg limit on precision. We train U-Net models on images of natural objects illuminated with coherent states of light, and find that the average mean-squared error of the reconstructions can surpass the standard quantum limit, and in some cases reaches the Heisenberg limit. Further, we train models on well-parameterized images for which we can calculate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound to determine the minimum possible measurable variance of an estimated parameter for a given probe state. We find the mean-squared error of the model predictions reaches these bounds calculated for the parameters, across a variety of parameterized images. These results suggest that deep convolutional neural networks can learn to become the optimal estimators allowed by the laws of physics, performing parameter estimation and image reconstruction at the ultimate possible limits of precision for the case of classical illumination of the object.

<title>The Price of Freedom: Exploring Expressivity and Runtime Tradeoffs in Equivariant Tensor Products</title>

Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have demonstrated success across a wide range of 3D modelling tasks. A fundamental operation in these networks is the tensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner to create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor product, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this operation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor product (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a careful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In particular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the same operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of expressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to characterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original implementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical grid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster on our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by 30\%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various tensor product operations. We find that the theoretical runtime guarantees can differ wildly from empirical performance, demonstrating the need for careful application-specific benchmarking.

<title>Seismic Acoustic Impedance Inversion Framework Based on Conditional Latent Generative Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Seismic acoustic impedance plays a crucial role in lithological identification and subsurface structure interpretation. However, due to the inherently ill-posed nature of the inversion problem, directly estimating impedance from post-stack seismic data remains highly challenging. Recently, diffusion models have shown great potential in addressing such inverse problems due to their strong prior learning and generative capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing methods operate in the pixel domain and require multiple iterations, limiting their applicability to field data. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel seismic acoustic impedance inversion framework based on a conditional latent generative diffusion model, where the inversion process is made in latent space. To avoid introducing additional training overhead when embedding conditional inputs, we design a lightweight wavelet-based module into the framework to project seismic data and reuse an encoder trained on impedance to embed low-frequency impedance into the latent space. Furthermore, we propose a model-driven sampling strategy during the inversion process of this framework to enhance accuracy and reduce the number of required diffusion steps. Numerical experiments on a synthetic model demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high inversion accuracy and strong generalization capability within only a few diffusion steps. Moreover, application to field data reveals enhanced geological detail and higher consistency with well-log measurements, validating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning. Previous research has focused on learning-augmented $k$-means in Euclidean metrics, limiting its applicability to complex data representations. In this paper, we generalize learning-augmented $k$-clustering to operate on general metrics, enabling its application to graph-structured and non-Euclidean domains. Our framework also relaxes restrictive cluster size constraints, providing greater flexibility for datasets with imbalanced or unknown cluster distributions. Furthermore, we extend the hardness of query complexity to general metrics: under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), we show that any polynomial-time algorithm must perform approximately $\Omega(k / \alpha)$ queries to achieve a $(1 + \alpha)$-approximation. These contributions strengthen both the theoretical foundations and practical applicability of learning-augmented clustering, bridging gaps between traditional methods and real-world challenges.

Abstract: We develop a rigorous stability framework for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) grounded in variational analysis, operator coercivity, and explicit perturbation theory. PINNs approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing residual-based losses over sampled collocation points. We derive deterministic stability bounds that quantify how bounded perturbations in the network output propagate through both residual and supervised loss components. Probabilistic stability is established via McDiarmid's inequality, yielding non-asymptotic concentration bounds that link sampling variability to empirical loss fluctuations under minimal assumptions. Generalization from Sobolev-norm training loss to uniform approximation is analyzed using coercivity and Sobolev embeddings, leading to pointwise error control. The theoretical results apply to both scalar and vector-valued PDEs and cover composite loss formulations. Numerical experiments validate the perturbation sensitivity, sample complexity estimates, and Sobolev-to-uniform generalization bounds. This work provides a mathematically grounded and practically applicable stability framework for PINNs, clarifying the role of operator structure, sampling design, and functional regularity in robust training.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) shows great promise in large-scale machine learning but introduces new privacy and security challenges. We propose ByITFL and LoByITFL, two novel FL schemes that enhance resilience against Byzantine users while keeping the users' data private from eavesdroppers. To ensure privacy and Byzantine resilience, our schemes build on having a small representative dataset available to the federator and crafting a discriminator function allowing the mitigation of corrupt users' contributions. ByITFL employs Lagrange coded computing and re-randomization, making it the first Byzantine-resilient FL scheme with perfect Information-Theoretic (IT) privacy, though at the cost of a significant communication overhead. LoByITFL, on the other hand, achieves Byzantine resilience and IT privacy at a significantly reduced communication cost, but requires a Trusted Third Party, used only in a one-time initialization phase before training. We provide theoretical guarantees on privacy and Byzantine resilience, along with convergence guarantees and experimental results validating our findings.

<title>A Production Scheduling Framework for Reinforcement Learning Under Real-World Constraints</title>

Abstract: The classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) focuses on optimizing makespan under deterministic constraints. Real-world production environments introduce additional complexities that cause traditional scheduling approaches to be less effective. Reinforcement learning (RL) holds potential in addressing these challenges, as it allows agents to learn adaptive scheduling strategies. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive, general-purpose frameworks for effectively training and evaluating RL agents under real-world constraints. To address this gap, we propose a modular framework that extends classical JSSP formulations by incorporating key \mbox{real-world} constraints inherent to the shopfloor, including transport logistics, buffer management, machine breakdowns, setup times, and stochastic processing conditions, while also supporting multi-objective optimization. The framework is a customizable solution that offers flexibility in defining problem instances and configuring simulation parameters, enabling adaptation to diverse production scenarios. A standardized interface ensures compatibility with various RL approaches, providing a robust environment for training RL agents and facilitating the standardized comparison of different scheduling methods under dynamic and uncertain conditions. We release JobShopLab as an open-source tool for both research and industrial applications, accessible at: https://github.com/proto-lab-ro/jobshoplab

<title>Flexible-length Text Infilling for Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling), the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements in training efficiency and flexibility.

<title>Calibrated Predictive Lower Bounds on Time-to-Unsafe-Sampling in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13593</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework to quantify the time-to-unsafe-sampling - the number of large language model (LLM) generations required to trigger an unsafe (e.g., toxic) response. Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive, per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.

Abstract: Generating rational and generally accurate responses to tasks, often accompanied by example demonstrations, highlights Large Language Model's (LLM's) remarkable In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities without requiring updates to the model's parameter space. Despite having an ongoing exploration focused on the inference from a document-level concept, its behavior in learning well-defined functions or relations in context needs a careful investigation. In this article, we present the performance of ICL on partially ordered relation by introducing the notion of inductively increasing complexity in prompts. In most cases, the saturated performance of the chosen metric indicates that while ICL offers some benefits, its effectiveness remains constrained as we increase the complexity in the prompts even in presence of sufficient demonstrative examples. The behavior is evident from our empirical findings and has further been theoretically justified in term of its implicit optimization process. The code is available \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ICLonPartiallyOrderSet}{here}.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in medical research by mitigating privacy concerns and enabling large-scale patient data analysis. This study presents a beta-Variational Autoencoder Graph Convolutional Neural Network framework for generating synthetic Abdominal Aorta Aneurysms (AAA). Using a small real-world dataset, our approach extracts key anatomical features and captures complex statistical relationships within a compact disentangled latent space. To address data limitations, low-impact data augmentation based on Procrustes analysis was employed, preserving anatomical integrity. The generation strategies, both deterministic and stochastic, manage to enhance data diversity while ensuring realism. Compared to PCA-based approaches, our model performs more robustly on unseen data by capturing complex, nonlinear anatomical variations. This enables more comprehensive clinical and statistical analyses than the original dataset alone. The resulting synthetic AAA dataset preserves patient privacy while providing a scalable foundation for medical research, device testing, and computational modeling.

Abstract: Many engineering and scientific fields have recently become interested in modeling terms in partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks. The resulting neural-network PDE model, being a function of the neural network parameters, can be calibrated to available data by optimizing over the PDE using gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated in a computationally efficient manner by solving an adjoint PDE. These neural-network PDE models have emerged as an important research area in scientific machine learning. In this paper, we study the convergence of the adjoint gradient descent optimization method for training neural-network PDE models in the limit where both the number of hidden units and the training time tend to infinity. Specifically, for a general class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs with a neural network embedded in the source term, we prove convergence of the trained neural-network PDE solution to the target data (i.e., a global minimizer). The global convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not encountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to (1) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network kernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks a spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (2) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE system, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem, even in the infinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neual network training cases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit). The theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical studies.

Abstract: We introduce xbench, a dynamic, profession-aligned evaluation suite designed to bridge the gap between AI agent capabilities and real-world productivity. While existing benchmarks often focus on isolated technical skills, they may not accurately reflect the economic value agents deliver in professional settings. To address this, xbench targets commercially significant domains with evaluation tasks defined by industry professionals. Our framework creates metrics that strongly correlate with productivity value, enables prediction of Technology-Market Fit (TMF), and facilitates tracking of product capabilities over time. As our initial implementations, we present two benchmarks: Recruitment and Marketing. For Recruitment, we collect 50 tasks from real-world headhunting business scenarios to evaluate agents' abilities in company mapping, information retrieval, and talent sourcing. For Marketing, we assess agents' ability to match influencers with advertiser needs, evaluating their performance across 50 advertiser requirements using a curated pool of 836 candidate influencers. We present initial evaluation results for leading contemporary agents, establishing a baseline for these professional domains. Our continuously updated evalsets and evaluations are available at https://xbench.org.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are essential for supporting a wide range of activities and decision-making processes, as well as mitigating the impacts of adverse weather events. While traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) remains the cornerstone of operational forecasting, machine learning is emerging as a powerful alternative for fast, flexible, and scalable predictions. We introduce PeakWeather, a high-quality dataset of surface weather observations collected every 10 minutes over more than 8 years from the ground stations of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss's measurement network. The dataset includes a diverse set of meteorological variables from 302 station locations distributed across Switzerland's complex topography and is complemented with topographical indices derived from digital height models for context. Ensemble forecasts from the currently operational high-resolution NWP model are provided as a baseline forecast against which to evaluate new approaches. The dataset's richness supports a broad spectrum of spatiotemporal tasks, including time series forecasting at various scales, graph structure learning, imputation, and virtual sensing. As such, PeakWeather serves as a real-world benchmark to advance both foundational machine learning research, meteorology, and sensor-based applications.

<title>We Should Identify and Mitigate Third-Party Safety Risks in MCP-Powered Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has entered in a experience-driven era, flagged by the emergence of environment feedback-driven learning via reinforcement learning and tool-using agents. This encourages the emergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how should a LLM interact with external services, such as \api and data. However, as MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces new safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are not controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party MCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic incentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In this position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay close attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop new techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our position, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \framework, a controlled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2) We then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks in MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial. (3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the following research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP safety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP safe ecosystem construction. We hope this position paper can raise the awareness of the research community in MCP safety and encourage more researchers to join this important research direction.

Abstract: Off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) typically leverages replay buffers for reusing past experiences during learning. This can help improve sample efficiency when the collected data is informative and aligned with the learning objectives; when that is not the case, it can have the effect of "polluting" the replay buffer with data which can exacerbate optimization challenges in addition to wasting environment interactions due to wasteful sampling. We argue that sampling these uninformative and wasteful transitions can be avoided by addressing the sunk cost fallacy, which, in the context of deep RL, is the tendency towards continuing an episode until termination. To address this, we propose learn to stop (LEAST), a lightweight mechanism that enables strategic early episode termination based on Q-value and gradient statistics, which helps agents recognize when to terminate unproductive episodes early. We demonstrate that our method improves learning efficiency on a variety of RL algorithms, evaluated on both the MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks.

<title>A Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer for Human Activity Intensity Prediction</title>

Abstract: Human activity intensity prediction is a crucial to many location-based services. Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints of spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial correlation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to integrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating constraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two spatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the likelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial interactions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon in transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be explicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws. This work provides a novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for spatiotemporal predictive learning.

<title>Hybrid Meta-learners for Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title>

Abstract: Estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) from observational data involves modeling decisions that differ from supervised learning, particularly concerning how to regularize model complexity. Previous approaches can be grouped into two primary "meta-learner" paradigms that impose distinct inductive biases. Indirect meta-learners first fit and regularize separate potential outcome (PO) models and then estimate CATE by taking their difference, whereas direct meta-learners construct and directly regularize estimators for the CATE function itself. Neither approach consistently outperforms the other across all scenarios: indirect learners perform well when the PO functions are simple, while direct learners outperform when the CATE is simpler than individual PO functions. In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid Learner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between the direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand. The H-learner achieves this by learning intermediate functions whose difference closely approximates the CATE without necessarily requiring accurate individual approximations of the POs themselves. We demonstrate empirically that intentionally allowing suboptimal fits to the POs improves the bias-variance tradeoff in estimating CATE. Experiments conducted on semi-synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets illustrate that the H-learner consistently operates at the Pareto frontier, effectively combining the strengths of both direct and indirect meta-learners.

Abstract: Training Transformers on algorithmic tasks frequently demonstrates an intriguing abrupt learning phenomenon: an extended performance plateau followed by a sudden, sharp improvement. This work investigates the underlying mechanisms for such dynamics, primarily in shallow Transformers. We reveal that during the plateau, the model often develops an interpretable partial solution while simultaneously exhibiting a strong repetition bias in their outputs. This output degeneracy is accompanied by internal representation collapse, where hidden states across different tokens become nearly parallel. We further identify the slow learning of optimal attention maps as a key bottleneck. Hidden progress in attention configuration during the plateau precedes the eventual rapid convergence, and directly intervening on attention significantly alters plateau duration and the severity of repetition bias and representational collapse. We validate that these identified phenomena-repetition bias and representation collapse-are not artifacts of toy setups but also manifest in the early pre-training stage of large language models like Pythia and OLMo.

<title>Meta-learning how to Share Credit among Macro-Actions</title>

Abstract: One proposed mechanism to improve exploration in reinforcement learning is through the use of macro-actions. Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the naive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather the opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful macros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively environment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different perspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between reducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size of the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action as independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and making typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we propose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between actions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by reducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving exploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned jointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy looking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment. Our results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all environments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is transferable to related environments. We believe this work is a small but important step towards understanding how the similarity-imposed geometry on the action space can be exploited to improve credit assignment and exploration, therefore making learning more effective.

<title>Value-Free Policy Optimization via Reward Partitioning</title>

Abstract: Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for single-trajectory policy optimization.

<title>TimeMaster: Training Time-Series Multimodal LLMs to Reason via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.

Abstract: We characterize the effectiveness of Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) under machine unlearning scheme, where unlearning forget signals interferes with learning retain signals. While previous work prove that SAM improves generalization with noise memorization prevention, we show that SAM abandons such denoising property when fitting the forget set, leading to various test error bounds depending on signal strength. We further characterize the signal surplus of SAM in the order of signal strength, which enables learning from less retain signals to maintain model performance and putting more weight on unlearning the forget set. Empirical studies show that SAM outperforms SGD with relaxed requirement for retain signals and can enhance various unlearning methods either as pretrain or unlearn algorithm. Observing that overfitting can benefit more stringent sample-specific unlearning, we propose Sharp MinMax, which splits the model into two to learn retain signals with SAM and unlearn forget signals with sharpness maximization, achieving best performance. Extensive experiments show that SAM enhances unlearning across varying difficulties measured by data memorization, yielding decreased feature entanglement between retain and forget sets, stronger resistance to membership inference attacks, and a flatter loss landscape.

<title>Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning As Neural Manifold Packing</title>

Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem. We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine learning.

<title>Attribution-guided Pruning for Compression, Circuit Discovery, and Targeted Correction in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI applications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments. Recent works in eXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that interpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing components irrelevant to inference. In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs. While LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend it to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially reduce model size with minimal performance loss. Our method is especially effective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' -- which can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification). Building on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively removing circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). All in all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase its effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for compression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models, highlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using video-inpainting diffusion transformer models. Unlike existing methods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse problems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks under a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward prediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states from initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based architecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer missing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video diffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning, while enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling. Extensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model offers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and problem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>MARCO: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Conformal Prediction Filtering</title>

arXiv:2506.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces MARCO (Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning with Conformal Optimization), a novel hardware-aware framework for efficient neural architecture search (NAS) targeting resource-constrained edge devices. By significantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict hardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and CAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its unique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal Prediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for deploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet approaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task into a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The HCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer bit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal within a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key innovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides statistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune unpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial training or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the search space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high probability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared to an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%). Furthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency. Validation on a MAX78000 evaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with simulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%.

<title>AI reconstruction of European weather from the Euro-Atlantic regimes</title>

Abstract: We present a non-linear AI-model designed to reconstruct monthly mean anomalies of the European temperature and precipitation based on the Euro-Atlantic Weather regimes (WR) indices. WR represent recurrent, quasi-stationary, and persistent states of the atmospheric circulation that exert considerable influence over the European weather, therefore offering an opportunity for sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting. While much research has focused on studying the correlation and impacts of the WR on European weather, the estimation of ground-level climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, from Euro-Atlantic WR remains largely unexplored and is currently limited to linear methods. The presented AI model can capture and introduce complex non-linearities in the relation between the WR indices, describing the state of the Euro-Atlantic atmospheric circulation and the corresponding surface temperature and precipitation anomalies in Europe. We discuss the AI-model performance in reconstructing the monthly mean two-meter temperature and total precipitation anomalies in the European winter and summer, also varying the number of WR used to describe the monthly atmospheric circulation. We assess the impact of errors on the WR indices in the reconstruction and show that a mean absolute relative error below 80% yields improved seasonal reconstruction compared to the ECMWF operational seasonal forecast system, SEAS5. As a demonstration of practical applicability, we evaluate the model using WR indices predicted by SEAS5, finding slightly better or comparable skill relative to the SEAS5 forecast itself. Our findings demonstrate that WR-based anomaly reconstruction, powered by AI tools, offers a promising pathway for sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasting.

<title>Discrete Diffusion in Large Language and Multimodal Models: A Survey</title>

Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. Despite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of absolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero but unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient model capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss value for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the optimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models, and develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant scalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this tool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of mainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training schedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B parameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting the optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled setting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.

Abstract: Comparison-based preference learning has become central to the alignment of AI models with human preferences. However, these methods may behave counterintuitively. After empirically observing that, when accounting for a preference for response $y$ over $z$, the model may actually decrease the probability (and reward) of generating $y$ (an observation also made by others), this paper investigates the root causes of (non) monotonicity, for a general comparison-based preference learning framework that subsumes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Generalized Preference Optimization (GPO) and Generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT). Under mild assumptions, we prove that such methods still satisfy what we call local pairwise monotonicity. We also provide a bouquet of formalizations of monotonicity, and identify sufficient conditions for their guarantee, thereby providing a toolbox to evaluate how prone learning models are to monotonicity violations. These results clarify the limitations of current methods and provide guidance for developing more trustworthy preference learning algorithms.

Abstract: We prove that any Turing machine running on inputs of arbitrary length can be simulated by a constant bit-size transformer, as long as the context window is sufficiently long. This improves previous works, which require scaling up either the model's precision or the number of parameters on longer inputs. Furthermore, we prove that the complexity class SPACE$[s(n)]$ exactly characterizes the expressive power of a constant bit-size transformer with a context window of length $s(n)$. Our approach relies on simulating Post machines, a Turing-complete computational model. Post machines can be modeled as automata equipped with a queue, exhibiting computational behaviors naturally aligned with those of transformers. The behavioral similarity between transformers and Post machines may offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying the reasoning abilities of transformers.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of traffic accidents is essential for improving city safety and informing policy decisions. In this study, we analyze traffic incidents in Munich to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish different types of accidents. The dataset consists of both structured tabular features, such as location, time, and weather conditions, as well as unstructured free-text descriptions detailing the circumstances of each accident. Each incident is categorized into one of seven predefined classes. To assess the reliability of these labels, we apply NLP methods, including topic modeling and few-shot learning, which reveal inconsistencies in the labeling process. These findings highlight potential ambiguities in accident classification and motivate a refined predictive approach. Building on these insights, we develop a classification model that achieves high accuracy in assigning accidents to their respective categories. Our results demonstrate that textual descriptions contain the most informative features for classification, while the inclusion of tabular data provides only marginal improvements. These findings emphasize the critical role of free-text data in accident analysis and highlight the potential of transformer-based models in improving classification reliability.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific information, e.g. sensitive or undesirable content, from large language models (LLMs) while preserving overall performance. We propose an inference-time unlearning algorithm that uses contrastive decoding, leveraging two auxiliary smaller models, one trained without the forget set and one trained with it, to guide the outputs of the original model using their difference during inference. Our strategy substantially improves the tradeoff between unlearning effectiveness and model utility. We evaluate our approach on two unlearning benchmarks, TOFU and MUSE. Results show notable gains in both forget quality and retained performance in comparison to prior approaches, suggesting that incorporating contrastive decoding can offer an efficient, practical avenue for unlearning concepts in large-scale models.

Abstract: Real-time continuous learning over streaming data remains a central challenge in deep learning and AI systems. Traditional gradient-based models such as backpropagation through time (BPTT) face computational and stability limitations when dealing with temporally unbounded data. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture, Quantum-Inspired Differentiable Integral Neural Networks (QIDINNs), which leverages the Feynman technique of differentiation under the integral sign to formulate neural updates as integrals over historical data. This reformulation allows for smoother, more stable learning dynamics that are both physically interpretable and computationally tractable. Inspired by Feynman's path integral formalism and compatible with quantum gradient estimation frameworks, QIDINNs open a path toward hybrid classical-quantum neural computation. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness on synthetic and real-world streaming tasks, and we propose directions for quantum extensions and scalable implementations.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid variational framework that enhances Neural Quantum States (NQS) with a Normalising Flow-based sampler to improve the expressivity and trainability of quantum many-body wavefunctions. Our approach decouples the sampling task from the variational ansatz by learning a continuous flow model that targets a discretised, amplitude-supported subspace of the Hilbert space. This overcomes limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and autoregressive methods, especially in regimes with long-range correlations and volume-law entanglement. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths, including regimes where competing methods fail. Our results showcase the utility of flow-assisted sampling as a scalable tool for quantum simulation and offer a new approach toward learning expressive quantum states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Abstract: Evaluating anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) requires careful consideration of temporal dependencies, particularly when detecting subsequence anomalies common in fault detection scenarios. While time series cross-validation (TSCV) techniques aim to preserve temporal ordering during model evaluation, their impact on classifier performance remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates the effect of TSCV strategy on the precision-recall characteristics of classifiers trained to detect fault-like anomalies in MTS datasets. We compare walk-forward (WF) and sliding window (SW) methods across a range of validation partition configurations and classifier types, including shallow learners and deep learning (DL) classifiers. Results show that SW consistently yields higher median AUC-PR scores and reduced fold-to-fold performance variance, particularly for deep architectures sensitive to localized temporal continuity. Furthermore, we find that classifier generalization is sensitive to the number and structure of temporal partitions, with overlapping windows preserving fault signatures more effectively at lower fold counts. A classifier-level stratified analysis reveals that certain algorithms, such as random forests (RF), maintain stable performance across validation schemes, whereas others exhibit marked sensitivity.

Abstract: The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the rise of deep learning have enabled the development of powerful predictive models for a wide range of diagnostic tasks in MRI, such as image classification or object segmentation. However, training models for specific new tasks often requires large amounts of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain due to high annotation costs and data privacy concerns. To circumvent this issue, we introduce MRI-CORE (MRI COmprehensive Representation Encoder), a vision foundation model pre-trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110,000 MRI volumes across 18 main body locations. Experiments on five diverse object segmentation tasks in MRI demonstrate that MRI-CORE can significantly improve segmentation performance in realistic scenarios with limited labeled data availability, achieving an average gain of 6.97% 3D Dice Coefficient using only 10 annotated slices per task. We further demonstrate new model capabilities in MRI such as classification of image properties including body location, sequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation. These results highlight the value of MRI-CORE as a generalist vision foundation model for MRI, potentially lowering the data annotation resource barriers for many applications.

Abstract: Quantum communication is poised to become a foundational element of next-generation networking, offering transformative capabilities in security, entanglement-based connectivity, and computational offloading. However, the classical OSI model-designed for deterministic and error-tolerant systems-cannot support quantum-specific phenomena such as coherence fragility, probabilistic entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and proposes an architectural redesign of the OSI model for quantum networks in the context of 7G. We introduce a Quantum-Converged OSI stack by extending the classical model with Layer 0 (Quantum Substrate) and Layer 8 (Cognitive Intent), supporting entanglement, teleportation, and semantic orchestration via LLMs and QML. Each layer is redefined to incorporate quantum mechanisms such as enhanced MAC protocols, fidelity-aware routing, and twin-based applications. This survey consolidates over 150 research works from IEEE, ACM, MDPI, arXiv, and Web of Science (2018-2025), classifying them by OSI layer, enabling technologies such as QKD, QEC, PQC, and RIS, and use cases such as satellite QKD, UAV swarms, and quantum IoT. A taxonomy of cross-layer enablers-such as hybrid quantum-classical control, metadata-driven orchestration, and blockchain-integrated quantum trust-is provided, along with simulation tools including NetSquid, QuNetSim, and QuISP. We present several domain-specific applications, including quantum healthcare telemetry, entangled vehicular networks, and satellite mesh overlays. An evaluation framework is proposed based on entropy throughput, coherence latency, and entanglement fidelity. Key future directions include programmable quantum stacks, digital twins, and AI-defined QNet agents, laying the groundwork for a scalable, intelligent, and quantum-compliant OSI framework for 7G and beyond.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as agents, calling external tools adaptively to solve tasks. Rather than directly calling tools, it can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls, enabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as conditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python code, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the ideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and reliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called Quasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve performance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate hallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate actions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically transpiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question answering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with Quasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while reducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing user approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by applying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) inference on power-constrained edge devices is bottlenecked by costly weight storage and data movement. We introduce MIWEN, a radio-frequency (RF) analog architecture that ``disaggregates'' memory by streaming weights wirelessly and performing classification in the analog front end of standard transceivers. By encoding weights and activations onto RF carriers and using native mixers as computation units, MIWEN eliminates local weight memory and the overhead of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion. We derive the effective number of bits of radio-frequency analog computation under thermal noise, quantify the energy--precision trade-off, and demonstrate digital-comparable MNIST accuracy at orders-of-magnitude lower energy, unlocking real-time inference on low-power, memory-free edge devices.

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are central to science and engineering applications including causal inference, scheduling, and neural architecture search. In this work, we introduce the DAG Convolutional Network (DCN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed specifically for convolutional learning from signals supported on DAGs. The DCN leverages causal graph filters to learn nodal representations that account for the partial ordering inherent to DAGs, a strong inductive bias does not present in conventional GNNs. Unlike prior art in machine learning over DAGs, DCN builds on formal convolutional operations that admit spectral-domain representations. We further propose the Parallel DCN (PDCN), a model that feeds input DAG signals to a parallel bank of causal graph-shift operators and processes these DAG-aware features using a shared multilayer perceptron. This way, PDCN decouples model complexity from graph size while maintaining satisfactory predictive performance. The architectures' permutation equivariance and expressive power properties are also established. Comprehensive numerical tests across several tasks, datasets, and experimental conditions demonstrate that (P)DCN compares favorably with state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. These results position (P)DCN as a viable framework for deep learning from DAG-structured data that is designed from first (graph) signal processing principles.

<title>SSLAM: Enhancing Self-Supervised Models with Audio Mixtures for Polyphonic Soundscapes</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-trained audio networks have seen widespread adoption in real-world systems, particularly in multi-modal large language models. These networks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the SSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio. However, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform in real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex, involving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are often benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as environmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to generalize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios, remains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical robustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap, we introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel direction in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the model's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong performance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio SSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of high-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves model performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds performance on standard audio SSL benchmarks. Notably, it achieves up to a 3.9\% improvement on the AudioSet-2M (AS-2M), reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 50.2. For polyphonic datasets, SSLAM sets new SOTA in both linear evaluation and fine-tuning regimes with performance improvements of up to 9.1\% (mAP).

Abstract: This textbook provides a systematic treatment of statistical machine learning for astronomical research through the lens of Bayesian inference, developing a unified framework that reveals connections between modern data analysis techniques and traditional statistical methods. We show how these techniques emerge from familiar statistical foundations. The consistently Bayesian perspective prioritizes uncertainty quantification and statistical rigor essential for scientific inference in astronomy. The textbook progresses from probability theory and Bayesian inference through supervised learning including linear regression with measurement uncertainties, logistic regression, and classification. Unsupervised learning topics cover Principal Component Analysis and clustering methods. We then introduce computational techniques through sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, followed by Gaussian Processes as probabilistic nonparametric methods and neural networks within the broader statistical context. Our theory-focused pedagogical approach derives each method from first principles with complete mathematical development, emphasizing statistical insight and complementing with astronomical applications. We prioritize understanding why algorithms work, when they are appropriate, and how they connect to broader statistical principles. The treatment builds toward modern techniques including neural networks through a solid foundation in classical methods and their theoretical underpinnings. This foundation enables thoughtful application of these methods to astronomical research, ensuring proper consideration of assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty propagation essential for advancing astronomical knowledge in the era of large astronomical surveys.

Abstract: We study the ability of language models to reason about appropriate information disclosure - a central aspect of the evolving field of agentic privacy. Whereas previous works have focused on evaluating a model's ability to align with human decisions, we examine the role of ambiguity and missing context on model performance when making information-sharing decisions. We identify context ambiguity as a crucial barrier for high performance in privacy assessments. By designing Camber, a framework for context disambiguation, we show that model-generated decision rationales can reveal ambiguities and that systematically disambiguating context based on these rationales leads to significant accuracy improvements (up to 13.3\% in precision and up to 22.3\% in recall) as well as reductions in prompt sensitivity. Overall, our results indicate that approaches for context disambiguation are a promising way forward to enhance agentic privacy reasoning.

Abstract: Collaborative robots must quickly adapt to their partner's intent and preferences to proactively identify helpful actions. This is especially true in situated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new high-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through demonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work together to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should be able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this information to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from the user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large language models, we introduce ProVox ("Proactive Voice"), a novel framework that enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual collaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to communicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors ahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized prompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a user's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to suggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the amount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot. We evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation tasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the collaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use, and reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity are critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less user burden relative to non-active baselines.

Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware. To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop driving simulations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have significantly impacted Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODS) but continue to face notable performance challenges, especially in zero-shot scenarios. While prior work has noted this performance gap, the behavioral factors driving the performance gap remain under-explored. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework to quantify the behavior gap between AI agents and human experts, focusing on discrepancies in dialog acts, tool usage, and knowledge utilization. Our findings reveal that this behavior gap is a critical factor negatively impacting the performance of LLM agents. Notably, as task complexity increases, the behavior gap widens (correlation: 0.963), leading to a degradation of agent performance on complex task-oriented dialogs. For the most complex task in our study, even the GPT-4o-based agent exhibits low alignment with human behavior, with low F1 scores for dialog acts (0.464), excessive and often misaligned tool usage with a F1 score of 0.139, and ineffective usage of external knowledge. Reducing such behavior gaps leads to significant performance improvement (24.3% on average). This study highlights the importance of comprehensive behavioral evaluations and improved alignment strategies to enhance the effectiveness of LLM-based TODS in handling complex tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification, pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models, ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture, chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in music-aware LLMs.

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency, and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties? In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy all three.

Abstract: We propose Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD), an extension of ARD for linearly probabilistic models, to simultaneously model sparse relationships between inputs $X \in \mathbb R^{d \times N}$ and outputs $Y \in \mathbb R^{m \times N}$, while capturing the correlation structure among the $Y$. NARD employs a matrix normal prior which contains a sparsity-inducing parameter to identify and discard irrelevant features, thereby promoting sparsity in the model. Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the precision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To mitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost per iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features sequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient approximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of determinant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential update with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs. The computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced to $\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$, respectively, where $p \ll d$ is the final number of features in the model. Our methods demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency with comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) at the wrists could enable natural, keyboard-free text entry, yet the state-of-the-art emg2qwerty baseline still misrecognizes $51.8\%$ of characters in the zero-shot setting on unseen users and $7.0\%$ after user-specific fine-tuning. We trace many of these errors to mismatched cross-user signal statistics, fragile reliance on high-order feature dependencies, and the absence of architectural inductive biases aligned with the bilateral nature of typing. To address these issues, we introduce three simple modifications: (i) Rolling Time Normalization, which adaptively aligns input distributions across users; (ii) Aggressive Channel Masking, which encourages reliance on low-order feature combinations more likely to generalize across users; and (iii) a Split-and-Share encoder that processes each hand independently with weight-shared streams to reflect the bilateral symmetry of the neuromuscular system. Combined with a five-fold reduction in spectral resolution ($33\!\rightarrow\!6$ frequency bands), these components yield a compact Split-and-Share model, SplashNet-mini, which uses only $\tfrac14$ the parameters and $0.6\times$ the FLOPs of the baseline while reducing character-error rate (CER) to $36.4\%$ zero-shot and $5.9\%$ after fine-tuning. An upscaled variant, SplashNet ($\tfrac12$ the parameters, $1.15\times$ the FLOPs of the baseline), further lowers error to $35.7\%$ and $5.5\%$, representing relative improvements of $31\%$ and $21\%$ in the zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, respectively. SplashNet therefore establishes a new state of the art without requiring additional data.

Abstract: Modern AI clusters, which host diverse workloads like data pre-processing, training and inference, often store the large-volume data in cloud storage and employ caching frameworks to facilitate remote data access. To avoid code-intrusion complexity and minimize cache space wastage, it is desirable to maintain a unified cache shared by all the workloads. However, existing cache management strategies, designed for specific workloads, struggle to handle the heterogeneous AI workloads in a cluster -- which usually exhibit heterogeneous access patterns and item storage granularities. In this paper, we propose IGTCache, a unified, high-efficacy cache for modern AI clusters. IGTCache leverages a hierarchical access abstraction, AccessStreamTree, to organize the recent data accesses in a tree structure, facilitating access pattern detection at various granularities. Using this abstraction, IGTCache applies hypothesis testing to categorize data access patterns as sequential, random, or skewed. Based on these detected access patterns and granularities, IGTCache tailors optimal cache management strategies including prefetching, eviction, and space allocation accordingly. Experimental results show that IGTCache increases the cache hit ratio by 55.6% over state-of-the-art caching frameworks, reducing the overall job completion time by 52.2%.

Abstract: This paper introduces Spectral Fault Receptive Fields (SFRFs), a biologically inspired technique for degradation state assessment in bearing fault diagnosis and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Drawing on the center-surround organization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a frequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of fault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic spectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory surrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under variable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization strategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field parameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing feature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method is demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its suitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring applications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs, inspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary optimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria; and (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults and their precursors. Furthermore, we confirm that our diagnosis-informed spectral representation achieves accurate RUL prediction using a bagging regressor. The results highlight the interpretability and principled design of SFRFs, bridging signal processing, biological sensing principles, and data-driven prognostics in rotating machinery.

Abstract: Explainable ML algorithms are designed to provide transparency and insight into their decision-making process. Explaining how ML models come to their prediction is critical in fields such as healthcare and finance, as it provides insight into how models can help detect bias in predictions and help comply with GDPR compliance in these fields. QML leverages quantum phenomena such as entanglement and superposition, offering the potential for computational speedup and greater insights compared to classical ML. However, QML models also inherit the black-box nature of their classical counterparts, requiring the development of explainability techniques to be applied to these QML models to help understand why and how a particular output was generated.
  This paper will explore the idea of creating a modular, explainable QML framework that splits QML algorithms into their core components, such as feature maps, variational circuits (ansatz), optimizers, kernels, and quantum-classical loops. Each component will be analyzed using explainability techniques, such as ALE and SHAP, which have been adapted to analyse the different components of these QML algorithms. By combining insights from these parts, the paper aims to infer explainability to the overall QML model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The release of open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen has triggered the development of numerous fine-tuned models tailored for various tasks and languages. In this paper, we explore an important question: is it possible to combine these specialized models to create a unified model with multi-task capabilities. We introduces Hierarchical Iterative Merging (Hi-Merging), a training-free method for unifying different specialized LLMs into a single model. Specifically, Hi-Merging employs model-wise and layer-wise pruning and scaling, guided by contribution analysis, to mitigate parameter conflicts. Extensive experiments on multiple-choice and question-answering tasks in both Chinese and English validate Hi-Merging's ability for multi-task learning. The results demonstrate that Hi-Merging consistently outperforms existing merging techniques and surpasses the performance of models fine-tuned on combined datasets in most scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require continuous updates to maintain accurate and current knowledge as the world evolves. While existing knowledge editing approaches offer various solutions for knowledge updating, they often struggle with sequential editing scenarios and harm the general capabilities of the model, thereby significantly hampering their practical applicability. This paper proposes a two-stage framework combining robust supervised fine-tuning (R-SFT) with model merging for knowledge editing. Our method first fine-tunes the LLM to internalize new knowledge fully, then merges the fine-tuned model with the original foundation model to preserve newly acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in sequential editing while better preserving the original performance of the model, all without requiring any architectural changes.

Abstract: The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to find a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This approach also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have experienced rapid advancements in recent years due to their ability to learn meaningful representations from graph data structures. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a viable machine learning approach for training a shared model on decentralized data, addressing privacy concerns while leveraging parallelism. Existing methods that address the unique requirements of federated GNN training using remote embeddings to enhance convergence accuracy are limited by their diminished performance due to large communication costs with a shared embedding server. In this paper, we present OpES, an optimized federated GNN training framework that uses remote neighbourhood pruning, and overlaps pushing of embeddings to the server with local training to reduce the network costs and training time. The modest drop in per-round accuracy due to pre-emptive push of embeddings is out-stripped by the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like Reddit and Products, converging up to $\approx2\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art technique using an embedding server and giving up to $20\%$ better accuracy than vanilla federated GNN learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Adjusted Shuffling SARAH, a novel algorithm that integrates shuffling techniques with the well-known variance-reduced algorithm SARAH while dynamically adjusting the stochastic gradient weights in each update to enhance exploration. Our method achieves the best-known gradient complexity for shuffling variance reduction methods in a strongly convex setting. This result applies to any shuffling technique, which narrows the gap in the complexity analysis of variance reduction methods between uniform sampling and shuffling data. Furthermore, we introduce Inexact Adjusted Reshuffling SARAH, an inexact variant of Adjusted Shuffling SARAH that eliminates the need for full-batch gradient computations. This algorithm retains the same linear convergence rate as Adjusted Shuffling SARAH while showing an advantage in total complexity when the sample size is very large.

Abstract: What fundamentally distinguishes an adversarial attack from a misclassification due to limited model expressivity or finite data? In this work, we investigate this question in the setting of high-dimensional binary classification, where statistical effects due to limited data availability play a central role. We introduce a new error metric that precisely capture this distinction, quantifying model vulnerability to consistent adversarial attacks -- perturbations that preserve the ground-truth labels. Our main technical contribution is an exact and rigorous asymptotic characterization of these metrics in both well-specified models and latent space models, revealing different vulnerability patterns compared to standard robust error measures. The theoretical results demonstrate that as models become more overparameterized, their vulnerability to label-preserving perturbations grows, offering theoretical insight into the mechanisms underlying model sensitivity to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Link prediction in multilayer networks is a key challenge in applications such as recommendation systems and protein-protein interaction prediction. While many techniques have been developed, most rely on assumptions about shared structures and require access to raw auxiliary data, limiting their practicality. To address these issues, we propose a novel transfer learning framework for multilayer networks using a bi-level model averaging method. A $K$-fold cross-validation criterion based on edges is used to automatically weight inter-layer and intra-layer candidate models. This enables the transfer of information from auxiliary layers while mitigating model uncertainty, even without prior knowledge of shared structures. Theoretically, we prove the optimality and weight convergence of our method under mild conditions. Computationally, our framework is efficient and privacy-preserving, as it avoids raw data sharing and supports parallel processing across multiple servers. Simulations show our method outperforms others in predictive accuracy and robustness. We further demonstrate its practical value through two real-world recommendation system applications.

Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) transmit delicate quantum information across noisy quantum channels. Crucial applications, like quantum key distribution (QKD) and distributed quantum computation (DQC), rely on efficient quantum information transmission. Learning the best path between a pair of end nodes in a QN is key to enhancing such applications. This paper addresses learning the best path in a QN in the online learning setting. We explore two types of feedback: "link-level" and "path-level". Link-level feedback pertains to QNs with advanced quantum switches that enable link-level benchmarking. Path-level feedback, on the other hand, is associated with basic quantum switches that permit only path-level benchmarking. We introduce two online learning algorithms, BeQuP-Link and BeQuP-Path, to identify the best path using link-level and path-level feedback, respectively. To learn the best path, BeQuP-Link benchmarks the critical links dynamically, while BeQuP-Path relies on a subroutine, transferring path-level observations to estimate link-level parameters in a batch manner. We analyze the quantum resource complexity of these algorithms and demonstrate that both can efficiently and, with high probability, determine the best path. Finally, we perform NetSquid-based simulations and validate that both algorithms accurately and efficiently identify the best path.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to boost the generalization capability of a trained model by conducting self-/unsupervised learning during the testing phase. While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual supervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent audio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates audio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic content of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the context of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping method by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals extracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video label spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection between the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the generated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines the optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes in loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized adaptation process for each sample. Experimental results on two widely used datasets (UCF101-C and Kinetics-Sounds-C), as well as on two newly constructed audio-video TTA datasets (AVE-C and AVMIT-C) with various corruption types, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method consistently improves adaptation performance across different video classification models and represents a significant step forward in integrating audio information into video TTA.

Abstract: This thesis deals with neural networks that respect symmetries and presents the advantages in applying them to lattice field theory problems. The concept of equivariance is explained, together with the reason why such a property is crucial for the network to preserve the desired symmetry. The benefits of choosing equivariant networks are first illustrated for translational symmetry on a complex scalar field toy model. The discussion is then extended to gauge theories, for which Lattice Gauge Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks (L-CNNs) are specifically designed ad hoc. Regressions of physical observables such as Wilson loops are successfully solved by L-CNNs, whereas traditional architectures which are not gauge symmetric perform significantly worse. Finally, we introduce the technique of neural gradient flow, which is an ordinary differential equation solved by neural networks, and propose it as a method to generate lattice gauge configurations.

Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized materials design, yet predicting complex properties like alloy ductility remains challenging due to the influence of processing conditions and microstructural features that resist quantification through traditional reductionist approaches. Here, we present an innovative information fusion architecture that integrates domain-specific texts from materials science literature with quantitative physical descriptors to overcome these limitations. Our framework employs MatSciBERT for advanced textual comprehension and incorporates contrastive learning to automatically extract implicit knowledge regarding processing parameters and microstructural characteristics. Through rigorous ablation studies and comparative experiments, the model demonstrates superior performance, achieving coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.849 and 0.680 on titanium alloy validation set and refractory multi-principal-element alloy test set. This systematic approach provides a holistic framework for property prediction in complex material systems where quantitative descriptors are incomplete and establishes a foundation for knowledge-guided materials design and informatics-driven materials discovery.

Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic, inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i) Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement, which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.

Abstract: In an age characterized by the proliferation of mis- and disinformation online, it is critical to empower readers to understand the content they are reading. Important efforts in this direction rely on manual or automatic fact-checking, which can be challenging for emerging claims with limited information. Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the political bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news outlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but understudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic and social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in social media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the criteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and political bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of prompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models (LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating sizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with multiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media popularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation study to highlight the key components of our dataset that contribute to these improvements. To facilitate future research, we released our dataset and code at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/llm-media-profiling.

Abstract: Inorganic synthesis planning currently relies primarily on heuristic approaches or machine-learning models trained on limited datasets, which constrains its generality. We demonstrate that language models, without task-specific fine-tuning, can recall synthesis conditions. Off-the-shelf models, such as GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0 Flash and Llama 4 Maverick, achieve a Top-1 precursor-prediction accuracy of up to 53.8 % and a Top-5 performance of 66.1 % on a held-out set of 1,000 reactions. They also predict calcination and sintering temperatures with mean absolute errors below 126 {\deg}C, matching specialized regression methods. Ensembling these language models further enhances predictive accuracy and reduces inference cost per prediction by up to 70 %. We subsequently employ language models to generate 28,548 synthetic reaction recipes, which we combine with literature-mined examples to pretrain a transformer-based model, SyntMTE. After fine-tuning on the combined dataset, SyntMTE reduces mean-absolute error in sintering temperature prediction to 73 {\deg}C and in calcination temperature to 98 {\deg}C. This strategy improves models by up to 8.7 % compared with baselines trained exclusively on experimental data. Finally, in a case study on Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state electrolytes, we demonstrate that SyntMTE reproduces the experimentally observed dopant-dependent sintering trends. Our hybrid workflow enables scalable, data-efficient inorganic synthesis planning.

Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that investing computing resources in searching for good initial noise for a text-to-image diffusion model helps improve performance. However, previous studies required external models to evaluate the resulting images, which is impossible on GPUs with small VRAM. For these reasons, we apply Best-of-N inference-time scaling to algorithms that optimize the initial noise of a diffusion model without external models across multiple datasets and backbones. We demonstrate that inference-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models in this setting quickly reaches a performance plateau, and a relatively small number of optimization steps suffices to achieve the maximum achievable performance with each algorithm.

Abstract: Our research addresses the critical challenge of managing blood transfusions and optimizing allocation in resource-constrained regions. We present heuristic matching algorithms for donor-patient and blood bank selection, alongside machine learning methods to analyze blood transfusion acceptance data and predict potential shortages. We developed simulations to optimize blood bank operations, progressing from random allocation to a system incorporating proximity-based selection, blood type compatibility, expiration prioritization, and rarity scores. Moving from blind matching to a heuristic-based approach yielded a 28.6% marginal improvement in blood request acceptance, while a multi-level heuristic matching resulted in a 47.6% improvement. For shortage prediction, we compared Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Linear Regression, and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, trained on 170 days of historical data. Linear Regression slightly outperformed others with a 1.40% average absolute percentage difference in predictions. Our solution leverages a Cassandra NoSQL database, integrating heuristic optimization and shortage prediction to proactively manage blood resources. This scalable approach, designed for resource-constrained environments, considers factors such as proximity, blood type compatibility, inventory expiration, and rarity. Future developments will incorporate real-world data and additional variables to improve prediction accuracy and optimization performance.

arXiv:2506.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iteration complexities for first-order optimization algorithms are typically stated in terms of a global Lipschitz constant of the gradient, and near-optimal results are achieved using fixed step sizes. But many objective functions that arise in practice have regions with small Lipschitz constants where larger step sizes can be used. Many local Lipschitz assumptions have been proposed, which have lead to results showing that adaptive step sizes and/or line searches yield improved convergence rates over fixed step sizes. However, these faster rates tend to depend on the iterates of the algorithm, which makes it difficult to compare the iteration complexities of different methods. We consider a simple characterization of global and local ("glocal") smoothness that only depends on properties of the function. This allows upper bounds on iteration complexities in terms of iterate-independent constants and enables us to compare iteration complexities between algorithms. Under this assumption it is straightforward to show the advantages of line searches over fixed step sizes, and that in some settings, gradient descent with line search has a better iteration complexity than accelerated methods with fixed step sizes. We further show that glocal smoothness can lead to improved complexities for the Polyak and AdGD step sizes, as well other algorithms including coordinate optimization, stochastic gradient methods, accelerated gradient methods, and non-linear conjugate gradient methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel statistical inference framework for streaming principal component analysis (PCA) using Oja's algorithm, enabling the construction of confidence intervals for individual entries of the estimated eigenvector. Most existing works on streaming PCA focus on providing sharp sin-squared error guarantees. Recently, there has been some interest in uncertainty quantification for the sin-squared error. However, uncertainty quantification or sharp error guarantees for entries of the estimated eigenvector in the streaming setting remains largely unexplored. We derive a sharp Bernstein-type concentration bound for elements of the estimated vector matching the optimal error rate up to logarithmic factors. We also establish a Central Limit Theorem for a suitably centered and scaled subset of the entries. To efficiently estimate the coordinate-wise variance, we introduce a provably consistent subsampling algorithm that leverages the median-of-means approach, empirically achieving similar accuracy to multiplier bootstrap methods while being significantly more computationally efficient. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in providing reliable uncertainty estimates with a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods.

Abstract: The mobile app market has expanded exponentially, offering millions of apps with diverse functionalities, yet research in mobile app recommendation remains limited. Traditional sequential recommender systems utilize the order of items in users' historical interactions to predict the next item for the users. Position embeddings, well-established in transformer-based architectures for natural language processing tasks, effectively distinguish token positions in sequences. In sequential recommendation systems, position embeddings can capture the order of items in a user's historical interaction sequence. Nevertheless, this ordering does not consider the time elapsed between two interactions of the same user (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month), referred to as "user rhythm". In mobile app recommendation datasets, the time between consecutive user interactions is notably longer compared to other domains like movies, posing significant challenges for sequential recommender systems. To address this phenomenon in the mobile app domain, we introduce INTERPOS, an Interaction Rhythm Guided Positional Morphing strategy for autoregressive mobile app recommender systems. INTERPOS incorporates rhythm-guided position embeddings, providing a more comprehensive representation that considers both the sequential order of interactions and the temporal gaps between them. This approach enables a deep understanding of users' rhythms at a fine-grained level, capturing the intricacies of their interaction patterns over time. We propose three strategies to incorporate the morphed positional embeddings in two transformer-based sequential recommendation system architectures. Our extensive evaluations show that INTERPOS outperforms state-of-the-art models using 7 mobile app recommendation datasets on NDCG@K and HIT@K metrics. The source code of INTERPOS is available at https://github.com/dlgrad/INTERPOS.

Abstract: Numerous tools for neural network inference are currently available, yet many do not meet the requirements of real-time audio applications. In response, we introduce anira, an efficient cross-platform library. To ensure compatibility with a broad range of neural network architectures and frameworks, anira supports ONNX Runtime, LibTorch, and TensorFlow Lite as backends. Each inference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by decoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The library incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking capabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different neural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to benchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to identify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate that for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For stateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance. Our results also indicate that for certain model-engine combinations, the initial inferences take longer, particularly when these inferences exhibit a higher incidence of real-time violations.

Abstract: Policymakers in resource-constrained settings require experimental designs that satisfy strict budget limits while ensuring precise estimation of treatment effects. We propose a framework that applies a dependent randomized rounding procedure to convert assignment probabilities into binary treatment decisions. Our proposed solution preserves the marginal treatment probabilities while inducing negative correlations among assignments, leading to improved estimator precision through variance reduction. We establish theoretical guarantees for the inverse propensity weighted and general linear estimators, and demonstrate through empirical studies that our approach yields efficient and accurate inference under fixed budget constraints.

<title>Adapting by Analogy: OOD Generalization of Visuomotor Policies via Functional Correspondence</title>

Abstract: End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors. However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds, or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil. The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator. Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and environment conditions with low feedback.

<title>MGDFIS: Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy for Small Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks, achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Abstract: This work addresses the task of self-supervised learning (SSL) on a long-tailed dataset that aims to learn balanced and well-separated representations for downstream tasks such as image classification. This task is crucial because the real world contains numerous object categories, and their distributions are inherently imbalanced. Towards robust SSL on a class-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online. We first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by back-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a domain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are designed to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently, we further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning while using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding network is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the strengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning. We also distil and transfer its embedding space to the training network to maintain balancedness and separability. Through experiments on four publicly available long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure. Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910C NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of 6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models. However, existing methods typically allocate compute uniformly across all queries, overlooking variation in query difficulty. To address this inefficiency, we formulate test-time compute allocation as a novel bandit learning problem and propose adaptive algorithms that estimate query difficulty on the fly and allocate compute accordingly. Compared to uniform allocation, our algorithms allocate more compute to challenging queries while maintaining accuracy on easier ones. Among challenging queries, our algorithms further learn to prioritize solvable instances, effectively reducing excessive computing on unsolvable queries. We theoretically prove that our algorithms achieve better compute efficiency than uniform allocation and empirically validate their effectiveness on math and code benchmarks. Specifically, our algorithms achieve up to an 11.10% performance improvement (15.04% relative) on the MATH-500 dataset and up to a 7.41% performance improvement (14.40% relative) on LiveCodeBench.

<title>Single Index Bandits: Generalized Linear Contextual Bandits with Unknown Reward Functions</title>

Abstract: Generalized linear bandits have been extensively studied due to their broad applicability in real-world online decision-making problems. However, these methods typically assume that the expected reward function is known to the users, an assumption that is often unrealistic in practice. Misspecification of this link function can lead to the failure of all existing algorithms. In this work, we address this critical limitation by introducing a new problem of generalized linear bandits with unknown reward functions, also known as single index bandits. We first consider the case where the unknown reward function is monotonically increasing, and propose two novel and efficient algorithms, STOR and ESTOR, that achieve decent regrets under standard assumptions. Notably, our ESTOR can obtain the nearly optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$ in terms of the time horizon $T$. We then extend our methods to the high-dimensional sparse setting and show that the same regret rate can be attained with the sparsity index. Next, we introduce GSTOR, an algorithm that is agnostic to general reward functions, and establish regret bounds under a Gaussian design assumption. Finally, we validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<title>Hierarchical Group-wise Ranking Framework for Recommendation Models</title>

Abstract: In modern recommender systems, CTR/CVR models are increasingly trained with ranking objectives to improve item ranking quality. While this shift aligns training more closely with serving goals, most existing methods rely on in-batch negative sampling, which predominantly surfaces easy negatives. This limits the model's ability to capture fine-grained user preferences and weakens overall ranking performance. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Group-wise Ranking Framework with two key components. First, we apply residual vector quantization to user embeddings to generate hierarchical user codes that partition users into hierarchical, trie-structured clusters. Second, we apply listwise ranking losses to user-item pairs at each level of the hierarchy, where shallow levels group loosely similar users and deeper levels group highly similar users, reinforcing learning-to-rank signals through progressively harder negatives. Since users with similar preferences and content exposure tend to yield more informative negatives, applying ranking losses within these hierarchical user groups serves as an effective approximation of hard negative mining. Our approach improves ranking performance without requiring complex real-time context collection or retrieval infrastructure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances both model calibration and ranking accuracy, offering a scalable and practical solution for industrial recommender systems.

Abstract: In autonomous underwater missions, the successful completion of predefined paths mainly depends on the ability of underwater vehicles to recognise their surroundings. In this study, we apply the concept of Fast Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (FIT2-FELM) to train a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang IT2 Fuzzy Inference System (TSK IT2-FIS) for on-board sonar data classification using an underwater vehicle called BlueROV2. The TSK IT2-FIS is integrated into a Hierarchical Navigation Strategy (HNS) as the main navigation engine to infer local motions and provide the BlueROV2 with full autonomy to follow an obstacle-free trajectory in a water container of 2.5m x 2.5m x 3.5m. Compared to traditional navigation architectures, using the proposed method, we observe a robust path following behaviour in the presence of uncertainty and noise. We found that the proposed approach provides the BlueROV with a more complete sensory picture about its surroundings while real-time navigation planning is performed by the concurrent execution of two or more tasks.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a critical challenge in robotics: translating text-driven human motions into executable actions for humanoid robots, enabling efficient and cost-effective learning of new behaviors. While existing text-to-motion generation methods achieve semantic alignment between language and motion, they often produce kinematically or physically infeasible motions unsuitable for real-world deployment. To bridge this sim-to-real gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework that integrates physics-aware motion evaluation with text-conditioned motion generation. RLPF employs a motion tracking policy to assess feasibility in a physics simulator, generating rewards for fine-tuning the motion generator. Furthermore, RLPF introduces an alignment verification module to preserve semantic fidelity to text instructions. This joint optimization ensures both physical plausibility and instruction alignment. Extensive experiments show that RLPF greatly outperforms baseline methods in generating physically feasible motions while maintaining semantic correspondence with text instruction, enabling successful deployment on real humanoid robots.

<title>From Experts to a Generalist: Toward General Whole-Body Control for Humanoid Robots</title>

Abstract: Achieving general agile whole-body control on humanoid robots remains a major challenge due to diverse motion demands and data conflicts. While existing frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid performance in the real world.

Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate enough dynamical models are vital for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review state-of-the-art nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a theoretical comparison of method properties. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for (chemical) process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction (reduction of FLOPS). Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.

Abstract: Generalization under distribution shift remains a core challenge in modern machine learning, yet existing learning bound theory is limited to narrow, idealized settings and is non-estimable from samples. In this paper, we bridge the gap between theory and practical applications. We first show that existing bounds become loose and non-estimable because their concept shift definition breaks when the source and target supports mismatch. Leveraging entropic optimal transport, we propose new support-agnostic definitions for covariate and concept shifts, and derive a novel unified error bound that applies to broad loss functions, label spaces, and stochastic labeling. We further develop estimators for these shifts with concentration guarantees, and the DataShifts algorithm, which can quantify distribution shifts and estimate the error bound in most applications -- a rigorous and general tool for analyzing learning error under distribution shift.

Abstract: Fair clustering has become a socially significant task with the advancement of machine learning technologies and the growing demand for trustworthy AI. Group fairness ensures that the proportions of each sensitive group are similar in all clusters. Most existing group-fair clustering methods are based on the $K$-means clustering and thus require the distance between instances and the number of clusters to be given in advance. To resolve this limitation, we propose a fair Bayesian model-based clustering called Fair Bayesian Clustering (FBC). We develop a specially designed prior which puts its mass only on fair clusters, and implement an efficient MCMC algorithm. Advantages of FBC are that it can infer the number of clusters and can be applied to any data type as long as the likelihood is defined (e.g., categorical data). Experiments on real-world datasets show that FBC (i) reasonably infers the number of clusters, (ii) achieves a competitive utility-fairness trade-off compared to existing fair clustering methods, and (iii) performs well on categorical data.

Abstract: The emergence of online social platforms, such as social networks and social media, has drastically affected the way people apprehend the information flows to which they are exposed. In such platforms, various information cascades spreading among users is the main force creating complex dynamics of opinion formation, each user being characterized by their own behavior adoption mechanism. Moreover, the spread of multiple pieces of information or beliefs in a networked population is rarely uncorrelated. In this paper, we introduce the Mixture of Interacting Cascades (MIC), a model of marked multidimensional Hawkes processes with the capacity to model jointly non-trivial interaction between cascades and users. We emphasize on the interplay between information cascades and user activity, and use a mixture of temporal point processes to build a coupled user/cascade point process model. Experiments on synthetic and real data highlight the benefits of this approach and demonstrate that MIC achieves superior performance to existing methods in modeling the spread of information cascades. Finally, we demonstrate how MIC can provide, through its learned parameters, insightful bi-layered visualizations of real social network activity data.

Abstract: Due to advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, the boundary between human-written text and AI-generated text has become blurred. Nevertheless, recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to reliably detect GPT-generated text. In this paper, we adopt a novel strategy to adversarially transform GPT-generated text using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, with the goal of making the text more human-like. We experiment with the Seq2Seq models T5-small and BART which serve to modify GPT-generated sentences to include linguistic, structural, and semantic components that may be more typical of human-authored text. Experiments show that classification models trained to distinguish GPT-generated text are significantly less accurate when tested on text that has been modified by these Seq2Seq models. However, after retraining classification models on data generated by our Seq2Seq technique, the models are able to distinguish the transformed GPT-generated text from human-generated text with high accuracy. This work adds to the accumulating knowledge of text transformation as a tool for both attack -- in the sense of defeating classification models -- and defense -- in the sense of improved classifiers -- thereby advancing our understanding of AI-generated text.

Abstract: Adversarial examples have attracted significant attention over the years, yet understanding their frequency-based characteristics remains insufficient. In this paper, we investigate the intriguing properties of adversarial examples in the frequency domain for the image classification task, with the following key findings. (1) As the high-frequency components increase, the performance gap between adversarial and natural examples becomes increasingly pronounced. (2) The model performance against filtered adversarial examples initially increases to a peak and declines to its inherent robustness. (3) In Convolutional Neural Networks, mid- and high-frequency components of adversarial examples exhibit their attack capabilities, while in Transformers, low- and mid-frequency components of adversarial examples are particularly effective. These results suggest that different network architectures have different frequency preferences and that differences in frequency components between adversarial and natural examples may directly influence model robustness. Based on our findings, we further conclude with three useful proposals that serve as a valuable reference to the AI model security community.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), propelled by advancements in machine learning, has made significant strides in solving complex tasks. However, the current neural network-based paradigm, while effective, is heavily constrained by inherent limitations, primarily a lack of structural organization and a progression of learning that displays undesirable properties. As AI research progresses without a unifying framework, it either tries to patch weaknesses heuristically or draws loosely from biological mechanisms without strong theoretical foundations. Meanwhile, the recent paradigm shift in evolutionary understanding -- driven primarily by evolutionary developmental biology (EDB) -- has been largely overlooked in AI literature, despite a striking analogy between the Modern Synthesis and contemporary machine learning, evident in their shared assumptions, approaches, and limitations upon careful analysis. Consequently, the principles of adaptation from EDB that reshaped our understanding of the evolutionary process can also form the foundation of a unifying conceptual framework for the next design philosophy in AI, going beyond mere inspiration and grounded firmly in biology's first principles. This article provides a detailed overview of the analogy between the Modern Synthesis and modern machine learning, and outlines the core principles of a new AI design paradigm based on insights from EDB. To exemplify our analysis, we also present two learning system designs grounded in specific developmental principles -- regulatory connections, somatic variation and selection, and weak linkage -- that resolve multiple major limitations of contemporary machine learning in an organic manner, while also providing deeper insights into the role of these mechanisms in biological evolution.

Abstract: Variational Learning (VL) has recently gained popularity for training deep neural networks and is competitive to standard learning methods. Part of its empirical success can be explained by theories such as PAC-Bayes bounds, minimum description length and marginal likelihood, but there are few tools to unravel the implicit regularization in play. Here, we analyze the implicit regularization of VL through the Edge of Stability (EoS) framework. EoS has previously been used to show that gradient descent can find flat solutions and we extend this result to VL to show that it can find even flatter solutions. This is obtained by controlling the posterior covariance and the number of Monte Carlo samples from the posterior. These results are derived in a similar fashion as the standard EoS literature for deep learning, by first deriving a result for a quadratic problem and then extending it to deep neural networks. We empirically validate these findings on a wide variety of large networks, such as ResNet and ViT, to find that the theoretical results closely match the empirical ones. Ours is the first work to analyze the EoS dynamics in VL.

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning tasks require outputs that satisfy hard constraints, such as physical conservation laws, structured dependencies in graphs, or column-level relationships in tabular data. Existing approaches rely either on domain-specific architectures and losses or on strong assumptions on the constraint space, restricting their applicability to linear or convex constraints. We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware refinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting from a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a deterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by constraint gradient corrections. The approach accommodates a wide class of non-convex and nonlinear equality constraints and can be applied post hoc to any base model. We demonstrate the method in two representative domains: constrained adversarial attack generation on tabular data with column-level dependencies and in AC power flow prediction under Kirchhoff's laws. Across both settings, our diffusion-guided refinement improves both constraint satisfaction and performance while remaining lightweight and model-agnostic.

Abstract: This work presents a formal framework for quantifying the internal dependencies between functional subsystems within artificial agents whose belief states are composed of structured linguistic fragments. Building on the Semantic Manifold framework, which organizes belief content into functional sectors and stratifies them across hierarchical levels of abstraction, we introduce a system of sectoral coupling constants that characterize how one cognitive sector influences another within a fixed level of abstraction. The complete set of these constants forms an agent-specific coupling profile that governs internal information flow, shaping the agent's overall processing tendencies and cognitive style. We provide a detailed taxonomy of these intra-level coupling roles, covering domains such as perceptual integration, memory access and formation, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and affective modulation. We also explore how these coupling profiles generate feedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive behavior. Methodologies for inferring these profiles from behavioral or internal agent data are outlined, along with a discussion of how these couplings evolve across abstraction levels. This framework contributes a mechanistic and interpretable approach to modeling complex cognition, with applications in AI system design, alignment diagnostics, and the analysis of emergent agent behavior.

<title>Reasoning Model Unlearning: Forgetting Traces, Not Just Answers, While Preserving Reasoning Skills</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled strong chain-of-thought (CoT) generation through test-time computation. While these multi-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model performance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the first systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the context of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the influence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained model without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms, originally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In particular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive information often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT trajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and propose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a novel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and prevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the model's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$ significantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and achieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks, evaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B.

Abstract: Data discovery and table unionability in particular became key tasks in modern Data Science. However, the human perspective for these tasks is still under-explored. Thus, this research investigates the human behavior in determining table unionability within data discovery. We have designed an experimental survey and conducted a comprehensive analysis, in which we assess human decision-making for table unionability. We use the observations from the analysis to develop a machine learning framework to boost the (raw) performance of humans. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary study on how LLM performance is compared to humans indicating that it is typically better to consider a combination of both. We believe that this work lays the foundations for developing future Human-in-the-Loop systems for efficient data discovery.

Abstract: Coupling of physics across length and time scales plays an important role in the response of microstructured materials to external loads. In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.

Abstract: Existing work in automatic music generation has primarily focused on end-to-end systems that produce complete compositions or continuations. However, because musical composition is typically an iterative process, such systems make it difficult to engage in the back-and-forth between human and machine that is essential to computer-assisted creativity. In this study, we address the task of personalizable, multi-track, long-context, and controllable symbolic music infilling to enhance the process of computer-assisted composition. We present MIDI-RWKV, a novel model based on the RWKV-7 linear architecture, to enable efficient and coherent musical cocreation on edge devices. We also demonstrate that MIDI-RWKV admits an effective method of finetuning its initial state for personalization in the very-low-sample regime. We evaluate MIDI-RWKV and its state tuning on several quantitative and qualitative metrics, and release model weights and code at https://github.com/christianazinn/MIDI-RWKV.

Abstract: Machine unlearning focuses on efficiently removing specific data from trained models, addressing privacy and compliance concerns with reasonable costs. Although exact unlearning ensures complete data removal equivalent to retraining, it is impractical for large-scale models, leading to growing interest in inexact unlearning methods. However, the lack of formal guarantees in these methods necessitates the need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess their privacy and effectiveness. In this work, we first identify several key pitfalls of the existing unlearning evaluation frameworks, e.g., focusing on average-case evaluation or targeting random samples for evaluation, incomplete comparisons with the retraining baseline. Then, we propose RULI (Rectified Unlearning Evaluation Framework via Likelihood Inference), a novel framework to address critical gaps in the evaluation of inexact unlearning methods. RULI introduces a dual-objective attack to measure both unlearning efficacy and privacy risks at a per-sample granularity. Our findings reveal significant vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art unlearning methods, where RULI achieves higher attack success rates, exposing privacy risks underestimated by existing methods. Built on a game-based foundation and validated through empirical evaluations on both image and text data (spanning tasks from classification to generation), RULI provides a rigorous, scalable, and fine-grained methodology for evaluating unlearning techniques.

Abstract: Wind energy significantly contributes to the global shift towards renewable energy, yet operational challenges, such as Leading-Edge Erosion on wind turbine blades, notably reduce energy output. This study introduces an advanced, scalable machine learning framework for condition monitoring of wind turbines, specifically targeting improved detection of anomalies using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. The framework effectively isolates normal turbine behavior through rigorous preprocessing, incorporating domain-specific rules and anomaly detection filters, including Gaussian Mixture Models and a predictive power score. The data cleaning and feature selection process enables identification of deviations indicative of performance degradation, facilitating estimates of annual energy production losses. The data preprocessing methods resulted in significant data reduction, retaining on average 31% of the original SCADA data per wind farm. Notably, 24 out of 35 turbines exhibited clear performance declines. At the same time, seven improved, and four showed no significant changes when employing the power curve feature set, which consisted of wind speed and ambient temperature. Models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN consistently captured subtle but persistent declines in turbine performance. The developed framework provides a novel approach to existing condition monitoring methodologies by isolating normal operational data and estimating annual energy loss, which can be a key part in reducing maintenance expenditures and mitigating economic impacts from turbine downtime.

Abstract: In recent years, embedding alignment has become the state-of-the-art machine translation approach, as it can yield high-quality translation without training on parallel corpora. However, existing research and application of embedding alignment mostly focus on high-resource languages with high-quality monolingual embeddings. It is unclear if and how low-resource languages may be similarly benefited. In this study, we implement an established supervised embedding alignment method for word translation from English to Yoruba, the latter a low-resource language. We found that higher embedding quality and normalizing embeddings increase word translation precision, with, additionally, an interaction effect between the two. Our results demonstrate the limitations of the state-of-the-art supervised embedding alignment when it comes to low-resource languages, for which there are additional factors that need to be taken into consideration, such as the importance of curating high-quality monolingual embeddings. We hope our work will be a starting point for further machine translation research that takes into account the challenges that low-resource languages face.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have led to remarkable interest in using systems that rely on large language models (LLMs) for practical applications. However, meaningful evaluation of these systems in real-world scenarios comes with a distinct set of challenges, which are not well-addressed by synthetic benchmarks and de-facto metrics that are often seen in the literature. We present a practical evaluation framework which outlines how to proactively curate representative datasets, select meaningful evaluation metrics, and employ meaningful evaluation methodologies that integrate well with practical development and deployment of LLM-reliant systems that must adhere to real-world requirements and meet user-facing needs.

Abstract: While certified robustness is widely promoted as a solution to adversarial examples in Artificial Intelligence systems, significant challenges remain before these techniques can be meaningfully deployed in real-world applications. We identify critical gaps in current research, including the paradox of detection without distinction, the lack of clear criteria for practitioners to evaluate certification schemes, and the potential security risks arising from users' expectations surrounding ``guaranteed" robustness claims. This position paper is a call to arms for the certification research community, proposing concrete steps to address these fundamental challenges and advance the field toward practical applicability.

Abstract: Evaluating foundation models for crystallographic reasoning requires benchmarks that isolate generalization behavior while enforcing physical constraints. This work introduces a multiscale multicrystal dataset with two physically grounded evaluation protocols to stress-test multimodal generative models. The Spatial-Exclusion benchmark withholds all supercells of a given radius from a diverse dataset, enabling controlled assessments of spatial interpolation and extrapolation. The Compositional-Exclusion benchmark omits all samples of a specific chemical composition, probing generalization across stoichiometries. Nine vision--language foundation models are prompted with crystallographic images and textual context to generate structural annotations. Responses are evaluated via (i) relative errors in lattice parameters and density, (ii) a physics-consistency index penalizing volumetric violations, and (iii) a hallucination score capturing geometric outliers and invalid space-group predictions. These benchmarks establish a reproducible, physically informed framework for assessing generalization, consistency, and reliability in large-scale multimodal models. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/StressTestingMMFMinCR.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/MultipoleAttention.

Abstract: While multimodal AI systems (models jointly trained on heterogeneous data types such as text, time series, graphs, and images) have become ubiquitous and achieved remarkable performance across high-stakes applications, transparent and accurate explanation algorithms are crucial for their safe deployment and ensure user trust. However, most existing explainability techniques remain unimodal, generating modality-specific feature attributions, concepts, or circuit traces in isolation and thus failing to capture cross-modal interactions. This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically misrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives multimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for interpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key principles for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style modality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality changes the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations capture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified stability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal perturbations). This targeted shift to multimodal explanations will help the community uncover hidden shortcuts, mitigate modality bias, improve model reliability, and enhance safety in high-stakes settings where incomplete explanations can have serious consequences.

Our system aims to improve the accuracy of translating named entities by combining two key approaches: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative self-refinement techniques using Large Language Models (LLMs). A distinctive feature of our system is its self-evaluation mechanism, where the LLM assesses its own translations based on two key criteria: the accuracy of entity translations and overall translation quality. We demonstrate how these methods work together and effectively improve entity handling while maintaining high-quality translations.

Abstract: Solving Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems is fundamental to robotics, but has primarily been successful with single serial manipulators. For multi-arm robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy, precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Adaptive Curriculum Sequencing (ACS) is essential for personalized online learning, yet current approaches struggle to balance complex educational constraints and maintain optimization stability. This paper proposes a Memetic Walrus Optimizer (MWO) that enhances optimization performance through three key innovations: (1) an expert-guided strategy with aging mechanism that improves escape from local optima; (2) an adaptive control signal framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation; and (3) a three-tier priority mechanism for generating educationally meaningful sequences. We formulate ACS as a multi-objective optimization problem considering concept coverage, time constraints, and learning style compatibility. Experiments on the OULAD dataset demonstrate MWO's superior performance, achieving 95.3% difficulty progression rate (compared to 87.2% in baseline methods) and significantly better convergence stability (standard deviation of 18.02 versus 28.29-696.97 in competing algorithms). Additional validation on benchmark functions confirms MWO's robust optimization capability across diverse scenarios. The results demonstrate MWO's effectiveness in generating personalized learning sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: In this white paper, we present AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent that substantially enhances capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on highly challenging tasks such as tackling open scientific problems or optimizing critical pieces of computational infrastructure. AlphaEvolve orchestrates an autonomous pipeline of LLMs, whose task is to improve an algorithm by making direct changes to the code. Using an evolutionary approach, continuously receiving feedback from one or more evaluators, AlphaEvolve iteratively improves the algorithm, potentially leading to new scientific and practical discoveries. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach by applying it to a number of important computational problems. When applied to optimizing critical components of large-scale computational stacks at Google, AlphaEvolve developed a more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers, found a functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of hardware accelerators, and accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning AlphaEvolve itself. Furthermore, AlphaEvolve discovered novel, provably correct algorithms that surpass state-of-the-art solutions on a spectrum of problems in mathematics and computer science, significantly expanding the scope of prior automated discovery methods (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023). Notably, AlphaEvolve developed a search algorithm that found a procedure to multiply two $4 \times 4$ complex-valued matrices using $48$ scalar multiplications; offering the first improvement, after 56 years, over Strassen's algorithm in this setting. We believe AlphaEvolve and coding agents like it can have a significant impact in improving solutions of problems across many areas of science and computation.

Abstract: Modern Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often operate on high-dimensional data and rely on overparameterized models, where classical low-dimensional intuitions break down. In particular, the proportional regime where the data dimension, sample size, and number of model parameters are all large and comparable, gives rise to novel and sometimes counterintuitive behaviors. This paper extends traditional Random Matrix Theory (RMT) beyond eigenvalue-based analysis of linear models to address the challenges posed by nonlinear ML models such as DNNs in this regime. We introduce the concept of High-dimensional Equivalent, which unifies and generalizes both Deterministic Equivalent and Linear Equivalent, to systematically address three technical challenges: high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and the need to analyze generic eigenspectral functionals. Leveraging this framework, we provide precise characterizations of the training and generalization performance of linear models, nonlinear shallow networks, and deep networks. Our results capture rich phenomena, including scaling laws, double descent, and nonlinear learning dynamics, offering a unified perspective on the theoretical understanding of deep learning in high dimensions.

To achieve these objectives, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) algorithm has been proposed to train its network management agent. Usually, their algorithms optimize their agents with respect to a single static reward formulation consisting of multiple objectives with fixed importance factors, which we call preferences. However, in practice, the preference could vary according to network status, external concerns and so on. For example, when a server shuts down and it can cause other servers' traffic overloads leading to additional shutdowns, it is plausible to reduce the preference of QoS while increasing the preference of minimum computing resource usages. In this paper, we propose new RL-based network management agents that can select actions based on both states and preferences. With our proposed approach, we expect a single agent to generalize on various states and preferences. Furthermore, we propose a numerical method that can estimate the distribution of preference that is advantageous for unbiased training. Our experiment results show that the RL agents trained based on our proposed approach significantly generalize better with various preferences than the previous RL approaches, which assume static preference during training. Moreover, we demonstrate several analyses that show the advantages of our numerical estimation method.

<title>Machine Learning as Iterated Belief Change a la Darwiche and Pearl</title>

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work, we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously, the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured, gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction -- that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.

<title>Efficient Approximate Temporal Triangle Counting in Streaming with Predictions</title>

Abstract: Triangle counting is a fundamental and widely studied problem on static graphs, and recently on temporal graphs, where edges carry information on the timings of the associated events. Streaming processing and resource efficiency are crucial requirements for counting triangles in modern massive temporal graphs, with millions of nodes and up to billions of temporal edges. However, current exact and approximate algorithms are unable to handle large-scale temporal graphs. To fill such a gap, we introduce STEP, a scalable and efficient algorithm to approximate temporal triangle counts from a stream of temporal edges. STEP combines predictions to the number of triangles a temporal edge is involved in, with a simple sampling strategy, leading to scalability, efficiency, and accurate approximation of all eight temporal triangle types simultaneously. We analytically prove that, by using a sublinear amount of memory, STEP obtains unbiased and very accurate estimates. In fact, even noisy predictions can significantly reduce the variance of STEP's estimates. Our extensive experiments on massive temporal graphs with up to billions of edges demonstrate that STEP outputs high-quality estimates and is more efficient than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets, they have raised significant privacy and ethical concerns due to their potential to inadvertently retain sensitive information. Unlearning seeks to selectively remove specific data from trained models, such as personal information or copyrighted content. Current approaches targeting specific output sequences at the token level often fail to achieve complete forgetting and remain susceptible to prompt rephrasing. We propose Align-then-Unlearn, a novel framework that performs unlearning in the semantic embedding space rather than directly on output tokens. Align-then-Unlearn first augments the LLM with an embedding prediction module trained to anticipate future context representations. Unlearning is then achieved by fine-tuning the model to minimize the similarity between these predicted embeddings and a target embedding that represents the concept to be removed. Initial results show that Align-then-Unlearn effectively removes targeted knowledge with minimal degradation in overall model utility. These findings suggest that embedding-based unlearning offers a promising and robust approach to removing conceptual knowledge. Our code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/align-then-unlearn.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is extensively employed in medical diagnostics and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to its non-invasive nature and high temporal resolution. However, EEG analysis faces significant challenges, including noise, nonstationarity, and inter-subject variability, which hinder its clinical utility. Traditional neural networks often lack integration with biophysical knowledge, limiting their interpretability, robustness, and potential for medical translation. To address these limitations, this study introduces NeuroPhysNet, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework tailored for EEG signal analysis and motor imagery classification in medical contexts. NeuroPhysNet incorporates the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, embedding neurodynamical principles to constrain predictions and enhance model robustness. Evaluated on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset, the framework achieved superior accuracy and generalization compared to conventional methods, especially in data-limited and cross-subject scenarios, which are common in clinical settings. By effectively integrating biophysical insights with data-driven techniques, NeuroPhysNet not only advances BCI applications but also holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and reliability of clinical diagnostics, such as motor disorder assessments and neurorehabilitation planning.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

<title>The impact of uncertainty on regularized learning in games</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how randomness and uncertainty influence learning in games. Specifically, we examine a perturbed variant of the dynamics of "follow-the-regularized-leader" (FTRL), where the players' payoff observations and strategy updates are continually impacted by random shocks. Our findings reveal that, in a fairly precise sense, "uncertainty favors extremes": in any game, regardless of the noise level, every player's trajectory of play reaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a pure strategy in finite time (which we estimate). Moreover, even if the player does not ultimately settle at this strategy, they return arbitrarily close to some (possibly different) pure strategy infinitely often. This prompts the question of which sets of pure strategies emerge as robust predictions of learning under uncertainty. We show that (a) the only possible limits of the FTRL dynamics under uncertainty are pure Nash equilibria; and (b) a span of pure strategies is stable and attracting if and only if it is closed under better replies. Finally, we turn to games where the deterministic dynamics are recurrent - such as zero-sum games with interior equilibria - and we show that randomness disrupts this behavior, causing the stochastic dynamics to drift toward the boundary on average.

Abstract: We introduce the task of Audible Action Temporal Localization, which aims to identify the spatio-temporal coordinates of audible movements. Unlike conventional tasks such as action recognition and temporal action localization, which broadly analyze video content, our task focuses on the distinct kinematic dynamics of audible actions. It is based on the premise that key actions are driven by inflectional movements; for example, collisions that produce sound often involve abrupt changes in motion. To capture this, we propose $TA^{2}Net$, a novel architecture that estimates inflectional flow using the second derivative of motion to determine collision timings without relying on audio input. $TA^{2}Net$ also integrates a self-supervised spatial localization strategy during training, combining contrastive learning with spatial analysis. This dual design improves temporal localization accuracy and simultaneously identifies sound sources within video frames. To support this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, $Audible623$, derived from Kinetics and UCF101 by removing non-essential vocalization subsets. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach on $Audible623$ and show strong generalizability to other domains, such as repetitive counting and sound source localization. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/WenlongWan/Audible623.

Abstract: Disassembly is a crucial yet challenging step in binary analysis. While emerging neural disassemblers show promise for efficiency and accuracy, they frequently generate outputs violating fundamental structural constraints, which significantly compromise their practical usability. To address this critical problem, we regularize the disassembly solution space by formalizing and applying key structural constraints based on post-dominance relations. This approach systematically detects widespread errors in existing neural disassemblers' outputs. These errors often originate from models' limited context modeling and instruction-level decoding that neglect global structural integrity. We introduce Tady, a novel neural disassembler featuring an improved model architecture and a dedicated post-processing algorithm, specifically engineered to address these deficiencies. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse binaries demonstrate that Tady effectively eliminates structural constraint violations and functions with high efficiency, while maintaining instruction-level accuracy.

Abstract: Fact verification is essential for ensuring the reliability of LLM applications. In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one specialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning LLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share three findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact verifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\% of ambiguous or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations, and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help identify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with few-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve top-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small models still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require complex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with synthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in such instances. We release our code, model, and dataset at https://github.com/just1nseo/verifying-the-verifiers

<title>Direct Reasoning Optimization: LLMs Can Reward And Refine Their Own Reasoning for Open-Ended Tasks</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming, largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended, particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level. Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized, enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks, reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and structured domains.

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic, outcome-based reward signals (e.g., final answer correctness), which limits the depth of learning from each interaction. This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel, process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation. Socratic-RL operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process itself. The framework employs a decoupled "Teacher-Student" architecture, where a "Teacher AI" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and formulates them into structured "viewpoints." These viewpoints, acting as distilled guidance, are then used by a "Student AI" to enhance its subsequent reasoning. A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning loop. To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters. By focusing on process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable architecture for self-improving AI systems. This paper details the foundational concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research roadmap for this proposed framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel retrieval approach that integrates textual knowledge graphs into the LLM reasoning process via query decomposition. Our method decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, retrieves relevant textual subgraphs, and composes a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. For that, we use a weighted similarity function that focuses on both the complex question and the generated subquestions to extract a relevant subgraph, which allows efficient and precise retrieval for complex questions and improves the performance of LLMs on multi-hop QA tasks. This structured reasoning pipeline enhances factual grounding and interpretability while leveraging the generative strengths of LLMs. We evaluate our method on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

Abstract: We study finite-armed semiparametric bandits, where each arm's reward combines a linear component with an unknown, potentially adversarial shift. This model strictly generalizes classical linear bandits and reflects complexities common in practice. We propose the first experimental-design approach that simultaneously offers a sharp regret bound, a PAC bound, and a best-arm identification guarantee. Our method attains the minimax regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT})$, matching the known lower bound for finite-armed linear bandits, and further achieves logarithmic regret under a positive suboptimality gap condition. These guarantees follow from our refined non-asymptotic analysis of orthogonalized regression that attains the optimal $\sqrt{d}$ rate, paving the way for robust and efficient learning across a broad class of semiparametric bandit problems.

Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is critical for high-performance Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing systems such as 5G New Radio, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio and stringent latency constraints. This letter presents HELENA, a compact deep learning model that combines a lightweight convolutional backbone with two efficient attention mechanisms: patch-wise multi-head self-attention for capturing global dependencies and a squeeze-and-excitation block for local feature refinement. Compared to CEViT, a state-of-the-art vision transformer-based estimator, HELENA reduces inference time by 45.0\% (0.175\,ms vs.\ 0.318\,ms), achieves comparable accuracy ($-16.78$\,dB vs.\ $-17.30$\,dB), and requires $8\times$ fewer parameters (0.11M vs.\ 0.88M), demonstrating its suitability for low-latency, real-time deployment.

Abstract: As DBS technology advances toward directional leads and optimization-based current steering, this study aims to improve the selection of electrode contact configurations using the recently developed L1-norm regularized L1-norm fitting (L1L1) method. The focus is in particular on L1L1's capability to incorporate a priori lead field uncertainty, offering a potential advantage over conventional approaches that do not account for such variability. Our optimization framework incorporates uncertainty by constraining the solution space based on lead field attenuation. This reflects physiological expectations about the VTA and serves to avoid overfitting. By applying this method to 8- and 40-contact electrode configurations, we optimize current distributions within a discretized finite element (FE) model, focusing on the lead field's characteristics. The model accounts for uncertainty through these explicit constraints, enhancing the feasibility, focality, and robustness of the resulting solutions. The L1L1 method was validated through a series of numerical experiments using both noiseless and noisy lead fields, where the noise level was selected to reflect attenuation within VTA. It successfully fits and regularizes the current distribution across target structures, with hyperparameter optimization extracting either bipolar or multipolar electrode configurations. These configurations aim to maximize focused current density or prioritize a high gain field ratio in a discretized FE model. Compared to traditional methods, the L1L1 approach showed competitive performance in concentrating stimulation within the target region while minimizing unintended current spread, particularly under noisy conditions. By incorporating uncertainty directly into the optimization process, we obtain a noise-robust framework for current steering, allowing for variations in lead field models and simulation parameters.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Peptide sequencing-the process of identifying amino acid sequences from mass spectrometry data-is a fundamental task in proteomics. Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have proven highly effective for this task, outperforming traditional methods. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate tokens sequentially, NATs predict all positions simultaneously, leveraging bidirectional context through unmasked self-attention. However, existing NAT approaches often rely on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, which presents significant optimization challenges due to CTC's complexity and increases the risk of training failures. To address these issues, we propose an improved non-autoregressive peptide sequencing model that incorporates a structured protein sequence curriculum learning strategy. This approach adjusts protein's learning difficulty based on the model's estimated protein generational capabilities through a sampling process, progressively learning peptide generation from simple to complex sequences. Additionally, we introduce a self-refining inference-time module that iteratively enhances predictions using learned NAT token embeddings, improving sequence accuracy at a fine-grained level. Our curriculum learning strategy reduces NAT training failures frequency by more than 90% based on sampled training over various data distributions. Evaluations on nine benchmark species demonstrate that our approach outperforms all previous methods across multiple metrics and species.

Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents' hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing") into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models, which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments with limited hardware.

Abstract: This paper comprehensively surveys research trends in imitation learning for contact-rich robotic tasks. Contact-rich tasks, which require complex physical interactions with the environment, represent a central challenge in robotics due to their nonlinear dynamics and sensitivity to small positional deviations. The paper examines demonstration collection methodologies, including teaching methods and sensory modalities crucial for capturing subtle interaction dynamics. We then analyze imitation learning approaches, highlighting their applications to contact-rich manipulation. Recent advances in multimodal learning and foundation models have significantly enhanced performance in complex contact tasks across industrial, household, and healthcare domains. Through systematic organization of current research and identification of challenges, this survey provides a foundation for future advancements in contact-rich robotic manipulation.

<title>TensorSLM: Energy-efficient Embedding Compression of Sub-billion Parameter Language Models on Low-end Devices</title>

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, or on-device LMs) have significantly fewer parameters than Large Language Models (LLMs). They are typically deployed on low-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs, which rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed for edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment environments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints, which are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these two requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State (MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across compression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption on a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion parameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our approach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model with around $2.0\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy consumption of a single query drops by half.

Abstract: Imitation learning from large multi-task demonstration datasets has emerged as a promising path for building generally-capable robots. As a result, 1000s of hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the globe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a systematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the utility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In this work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this question. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common sources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object types and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with controlled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that would be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical settings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future researchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should current practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets to maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study yields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and spatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection and alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that not only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval strategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently outperform existing training strategies by up to 70%.

Abstract: Transformer models face scalability challenges in causal language modeling (CLM) due to inefficient memory allocation for growing key-value (KV) caches, which strains compute and storage resources. Existing methods like Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and token-level KV optimization improve efficiency but rely on rigid resource allocation, often discarding "low-priority" tokens or statically grouping them, failing to address the dynamic spectrum of token importance. We propose mixSGA, a novel mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach that dynamically optimizes token-wise computation and memory allocation. Unlike prior approaches, mixSGA retains all tokens while adaptively routing them to specialized experts with varying KV group sizes, balancing granularity and efficiency. Our key novelties include: (1) a token-wise expert-choice routing mechanism guided by learned importance scores, enabling proportional resource allocation without token discard; (2) weight-sharing across grouped attention projections to minimize parameter overhead; and (3) an auxiliary loss to ensure one-hot routing decisions for training-inference consistency in CLMs. Extensive evaluations across Llama3, TinyLlama, OPT, and Gemma2 model families show mixSGA's superiority over static baselines. On instruction-following and continued pretraining tasks, mixSGA achieves higher ROUGE-L and lower perplexity under the same KV budgets.

Abstract: We present an experimental study of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogator based on a silicon oxynitride (SiON) photonic integrated arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). While AWG-based interrogators are compact and scalable, their practical performance is limited by non-ideal spectral responses. To address this, two calibration strategies within a 2.4 nm spectral region were compared: (1) a segmented analytical model based on a sigmoid fitting function, and (2) a machine learning (ML)-based regression model. The analytical method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.11 pm within the calibrated range, while the ML approach based on exponential regression achieves 3.17 pm. Moreover, the ML model demonstrates generalization across an extended 2.9 nm wavelength span, maintaining sub-5 pm accuracy without re-fitting. Residual and error distribution analyses further illustrate the trade-offs between the two approaches. ML-based calibration provides a robust, data-driven alternative to analytical methods, delivering enhanced accuracy for non-ideal channel responses, reduced manual calibration effort, and improved scalability across diverse FBG sensor configurations.

Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.

<title>MiniMax-M1: Scaling Test-Time Compute Efficiently with Lightning Attention</title>

Abstract: We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale hybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model, which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1 million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants. Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on 512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just $534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly release MiniMax-M1 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1.

Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach in Bayesian inference, that looks for the best approximation of the posterior distribution within a parametric family, minimizing a loss that is typically the (reverse) Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this paper, we focus on the following parametric family: mixtures of isotropic Gaussians (i.e., with diagonal covariance matrices proportional to the identity) and uniform weights. We develop a variational framework and provide efficient algorithms suited for this family. In contrast with mixtures of Gaussian with generic covariance matrices, this choice presents a balance between accurate approximations of multimodal Bayesian posteriors, while being memory and computationally efficient. Our algorithms implement gradient descent on the location of the mixture components (the modes of the Gaussians), and either (an entropic) Mirror or Bures descent on their variance parameters. We illustrate the performance of our algorithms on numerical experiments.

<title>Exploiting the Exact Denoising Posterior Score in Training-Free Guidance of Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has driven interest in performing conditional sampling via training-free guidance of the denoising process to solve image restoration and other inverse problems. A popular class of methods, based on Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity, this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.

Abstract: The EUNIS habitat classification is crucial for categorising European habitats, supporting European policy on nature conservation and implementing the Nature Restoration Law. To meet the growing demand for detailed and accurate habitat information, we provide spatial predictions for 260 EUNIS habitat types at hierarchical level 3, together with independent validation and uncertainty analyses.
  Using ensemble machine learning models, together with high-resolution satellite imagery and ecologically meaningful climatic, topographic and edaphic variables, we produced a European habitat map indicating the most probable EUNIS habitat at 100-m resolution across Europe. Additionally, we provide information on prediction uncertainty and the most probable habitats at level 3 within each EUNIS level 1 formation. This product is particularly useful for both conservation and restoration purposes.
  Predictions were cross-validated at European scale using a spatial block cross-validation and evaluated against independent data from France (forests only), the Netherlands and Austria. The habitat maps obtained strong predictive performances on the validation datasets with distinct trade-offs in terms of recall and precision across habitat formations.

Abstract: We introduce the Lecture Video Visual Objects (LVVO) dataset, a new benchmark for visual object detection in educational video content. The dataset consists of 4,000 frames extracted from 245 lecture videos spanning biology, computer science, and geosciences. A subset of 1,000 frames, referred to as LVVO_1k, has been manually annotated with bounding boxes for four visual categories: Table, Chart-Graph, Photographic-image, and Visual-illustration. Each frame was labeled independently by two annotators, resulting in an inter-annotator F1 score of 83.41%, indicating strong agreement. To ensure high-quality consensus annotations, a third expert reviewed and resolved all cases of disagreement through a conflict resolution process. To expand the dataset, a semi-supervised approach was employed to automatically annotate the remaining 3,000 frames, forming LVVO_3k. The complete dataset offers a valuable resource for developing and evaluating both supervised and semi-supervised methods for visual content detection in educational videos. The LVVO dataset is publicly available to support further research in this domain.

Abstract: Inference and prediction under partial knowledge of a physical system is challenging, particularly when multiple confounding sources influence the measured response. Explicitly accounting for these influences in physics-based models is often infeasible due to epistemic uncertainty, cost, or time constraints, resulting in models that fail to accurately describe the behavior of the system. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning models such as variational autoencoders are not guaranteed to identify a parsimonious representation. As a result, they can suffer from poor generalization performance and reconstruction accuracy in the regime of limited and noisy data. We propose a physics-informed variational autoencoder architecture that combines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven models. To promote disentanglement of the known physics and confounding influences, the latent space is partitioned into physically meaningful variables that parametrize a physics-based model, and data-driven variables that capture variability in the domain and class of the physical system. The encoder is coupled with a decoder that integrates physics-based and data-driven components, and constrained by an adversarial training objective that prevents the data-driven components from overriding the known physics, ensuring that the physics-grounded latent variables remain interpretable. We demonstrate that the model is able to disentangle features of the input signal and separate the known physics from confounding influences using supervision in the form of class and domain observables. The model is evaluated on a series of synthetic case studies relevant to engineering structures, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs, affecting both research and real-world applications. Recently, Nguyen et al. 2024's "Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM Outputs" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p sampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection for an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the original paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task, and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve over baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the number of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported. Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars) were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised adoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasts are typically obtained using state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models, with model parameters estimated by optimizing a proper scoring rule over a set of training data. If the model class is not correctly specified, then the learned model will not necessarily issue forecasts that are calibrated. Calibrated forecasts allow users to appropriately balance risks in decision making, and it is particularly important that forecast models issue calibrated predictions for extreme events, since such outcomes often generate large socio-economic impacts. In this work, we study how the loss function used to train probabilistic forecast models can be adapted to improve the reliability of forecasts made for extreme events. We investigate loss functions based on weighted scoring rules, and additionally propose regularizing loss functions using a measure of tail miscalibration. We apply these approaches to a hierarchy of increasingly flexible forecast models for UK wind speeds, including simple parametric models, distributional regression networks, and conditional generative models. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art models do not issue calibrated forecasts for extreme wind speeds, and that the calibration of forecasts for extreme events can be improved by suitable adaptations to the loss function during model training. This, however, introduces a trade-off between calibrated forecasts for extreme events and calibrated forecasts for more common outcomes.

Abstract: In this work, we develop new optimization algorithms that use approximate second-order information combined with the gradient regularization technique to achieve fast global convergence rates for both convex and non-convex objectives. The key innovation of our analysis is a novel notion called Gradient-Normalized Smoothness, which characterizes the maximum radius of a ball around the current point that yields a good relative approximation of the gradient field. Our theory establishes a natural intrinsic connection between Hessian approximation and the linearization of the gradient. Importantly, Gradient-Normalized Smoothness does not depend on the specific problem class of the objective functions, while effectively translating local information about the gradient field and Hessian approximation into the global behavior of the method. This new concept equips approximate second-order algorithms with universal global convergence guarantees, recovering state-of-the-art rates for functions with H\"older-continuous Hessians and third derivatives, quasi-self-concordant functions, as well as smooth classes in first-order optimization. These rates are achieved automatically and extend to broader classes, such as generalized self-concordant functions. We demonstrate direct applications of our results for global linear rates in logistic regression and softmax problems with approximate Hessians, as well as in non-convex optimization using Fisher and Gauss-Newton approximations.

Abstract: We introduce a frequency-domain framework for convergence analysis of hyperparameters in game optimization, leveraging High-Resolution Differential Equations (HRDEs) and Laplace transforms. Focusing on the Lookahead algorithm--characterized by gradient steps $k$ and averaging coefficient $\alpha$--we transform the discrete-time oscillatory dynamics of bilinear games into the frequency domain to derive precise convergence criteria. Our higher-precision $O(\gamma^2)$-HRDE models yield tighter criteria, while our first-order $O(\gamma)$-HRDE models offer practical guidance by prioritizing actionable hyperparameter tuning over complex closed-form solutions. Empirical validation in discrete-time settings demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which may further extend to locally linear operators, offering a scalable framework for selecting hyperparameters for learning in games.

Abstract: Equivariant and invariant machine learning models exploit symmetries and structural patterns in data to improve sample efficiency. While empirical studies suggest that data-driven methods such as regularization and data augmentation can perform comparably to explicitly invariant models, theoretical insights remain scarce. In this paper, we provide a theoretical comparison of three approaches for achieving invariance: data augmentation, regularization, and hard-wiring. We focus on mean squared error regression with deep linear networks, which parametrize rank-bounded linear maps and can be hard-wired to be invariant to specific group actions. We show that the critical points of the optimization problems for hard-wiring and data augmentation are identical, consisting solely of saddles and the global optimum. By contrast, regularization introduces additional critical points, though they remain saddles except for the global optimum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the regularization path is continuous and converges to the hard-wired solution.

Abstract: The introduction of advanced reasoning capabilities have improved the problem-solving performance of large language models, particularly on math and coding benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these reasoning models are more or less vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks than their non-reasoning counterparts. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of weaknesses in advanced reasoning models compared to similar non-reasoning models across a diverse set of prompt-based attack categories. Using experimental data, we find that on average the reasoning-augmented models are \emph{slightly more robust} than non-reasoning models (42.51\% vs 45.53\% attack success rate, lower is better). However, this overall trend masks significant category-specific differences: for certain attack types the reasoning models are substantially \emph{more vulnerable} (e.g., up to 32 percentage points worse on a tree-of-attacks prompt), while for others they are markedly \emph{more robust} (e.g., 29.8 points better on cross-site scripting injection). Our findings highlight the nuanced security implications of advanced reasoning in language models and emphasize the importance of stress-testing safety across diverse adversarial techniques.

Abstract: Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central challenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting (InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions. Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both traditional prompting and latent steering.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning behaviors from human feedback without predefined reward functions. However, current PbRL methods face a critical challenge in effectively exploring the preference space, often converging prematurely to suboptimal policies that satisfy only a narrow subset of human preferences. In this work, we identify and address this preference exploration problem through population-based methods. We demonstrate that maintaining a diverse population of agents enables more comprehensive exploration of the preference landscape compared to single-agent approaches. Crucially, this diversity improves reward model learning by generating preference queries with clearly distinguishable behaviors, a key factor in real-world scenarios where humans must easily differentiate between options to provide meaningful feedback. Our experiments reveal that current methods may fail by getting stuck in local optima, requiring excessive feedback, or degrading significantly when human evaluators make errors on similar trajectories, a realistic scenario often overlooked by methods relying on perfect oracle teachers. Our population-based approach demonstrates robust performance when teachers mislabel similar trajectory segments and shows significantly enhanced preference exploration capabilities,particularly in environments with complex reward landscapes.

<title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Phishing Detection, Self-Consistency, Faithfulness, and Explainability</title>

Abstract: Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent cybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying tactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, faithfully reproducing the interpretable reasoning with classification and explainability that underpin phishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction and potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks. However, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models requires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and trustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key question remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but also generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and internally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned transformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve domain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions, using Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in phishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure based on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token alignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover the rationale behind its predictions and reasoning. Overall, our findings show that Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with higher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy, whereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables a set of client devices to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data. This process, though, operates under the constrained computation and communication resources of edge devices. These constraints combined with systems heterogeneity force some participating clients to perform fewer local updates than expected by the server, thus slowing down convergence. Exhaustive tuning of hyperparameters in FL, furthermore, can be resource-intensive, without which the convergence is adversely affected. In this work, we propose GEL, the guess and learn algorithm. GEL enables constrained edge devices to perform additional learning through guessed updates on top of gradient-based steps. These guesses are gradientless, i.e., participating clients leverage them for free. Our generic guessing algorithm (i) can be flexibly combined with several state-of-the-art algorithms including FEDPROX, FEDNOVA, FEDYOGI or SCALEFL; and (ii) achieves significantly improved performance when the learning rates are not best tuned. We conduct extensive experiments and show that GEL can boost empirical convergence by up to 40% in resource constrained networks while relieving the need for exhaustive learning rate tuning.

Abstract: An abundance of recent impossibility results establish that regret minimization in Markov games with adversarial opponents is both statistically and computationally intractable. Nevertheless, none of these results preclude the possibility of regret minimization under the assumption that all parties adopt the same learning procedure. In this work, we present the first (to our knowledge) algorithm for learning in general-sum Markov games that provides sublinear regret guarantees when executed by all agents. The bounds we obtain are for swap regret, and thus, along the way, imply convergence to a correlated equilibrium. Our algorithm is decentralized, computationally efficient, and does not require any communication between agents. Our key observation is that online learning via policy optimization in Markov games essentially reduces to a form of weighted regret minimization, with unknown weights determined by the path length of the agents' policy sequence. Consequently, controlling the path length leads to weighted regret objectives for which sufficiently adaptive algorithms provide sublinear regret guarantees.

Abstract: We derive a set of causal deep neural networks whose architectures are a consequence of tensor (multilinear) factor analysis, a framework that facilitates causal inference. Forward causal questions are addressed with a neural network architecture composed of causal capsules and a tensor transformer. Causal capsules compute a set of invariant causal factor representations, whose interactions are governed by a tensor transformation. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements the multilinear projection algorithm. The architecture reverses the order of operations of a forward neural network and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse questions may be addressed with shallow architectures, but for computationally scalable solutions, we derive a set of deep neural networks by taking advantage of block algebra. An interleaved kernel hierarchy results in doubly non-linear tensor factor models. The causal neural networks that are a consequence of tensor factor analysis are data agnostic, but are illustrated with facial images. Sequential, parallel and asynchronous parallel computation strategies are described.

Abstract: Complementary-label learning (CLL) is a weakly-supervised learning paradigm that aims to train a multi-class classifier using only complementary labels, which indicate classes to which an instance does not belong. Despite numerous algorithmic proposals for CLL, their practical applicability remains unverified for two reasons. Firstly, these algorithms often rely on assumptions about the generation of complementary labels, and it is not clear how far the assumptions are from reality. Secondly, their evaluation has been limited to synthetically labeled datasets. To gain insights into the real-world performance of CLL algorithms, we developed a protocol to collect complementary labels from human annotators. Our efforts resulted in the creation of four datasets: CLCIFAR10, CLCIFAR20, CLMicroImageNet10, and CLMicroImageNet20, derived from well-known classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet200. These datasets represent the very first real-world CLL datasets, namely CLImage, which are publicly available at: https://github.com/ntucllab/CLImage\_Dataset. Through extensive benchmark experiments, we discovered a notable decrease in performance when transitioning from synthetically labeled datasets to real-world datasets. We investigated the key factors contributing to the decrease with a thorough dataset-level ablation study. Our analyses highlight annotation noise as the most influential factor in the real-world datasets. In addition, we discover that the biased-nature of human-annotated complementary labels and the difficulty to validate with only complementary labels are two outstanding barriers to practical CLL. These findings suggest that the community focus more research efforts on developing CLL algorithms and validation schemes that are robust to noisy and biased complementary-label distributions.

<title>Computing the Distance between unbalanced Distributions -- The flat Metric</title>

Abstract: We provide an implementation to compute the flat metric in any dimension. The flat metric, also called dual bounded Lipschitz distance, generalizes the well-known Wasserstein distance $W_1$ to the case that the distributions are of unequal total mass. Thus, our implementation adapts very well to mass differences and uses them to distinguish between different distributions. This is of particular interest for unbalanced optimal transport tasks and for the analysis of data distributions where the sample size is important or normalization is not possible. The core of the method is based on a neural network to determine an optimal test function realizing the distance between two given measures. Special focus was put on achieving comparability of pairwise computed distances from independently trained networks. We tested the quality of the output in several experiments where ground truth was available as well as with simulated data.

Abstract: One of the most significant challenges in Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation is the statistical discrepancy between distinct treatment groups. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic data augmentation method for CATE estimation. First, we derive regret bounds for general data augmentation methods suggesting that a small imputation error may be necessary for accurate CATE estimation. Inspired by this idea, we propose a contrastive learning approach that reliably imputes missing potential outcomes for a selected subset of individuals formed using a similarity measure. We augment the original dataset with these reliable imputations to reduce the discrepancy between different treatment groups while inducing minimal imputation error. The augmented dataset can subsequently be employed to train standard CATE estimation models. We provide both theoretical guarantees and extensive numerical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in improving the accuracy and robustness of numerous CATE estimation models.

Abstract: In the rapidly growing literature on explanation algorithms, it often remains unclear what precisely these algorithms are for and how they should be used. In this position paper, we argue for a novel and pragmatic perspective: Explainable machine learning needs to recognize its parallels with applied statistics. Concretely, explanations are statistics of high-dimensional functions, and we should think about them analogously to traditional statistical quantities. Among others, this implies that we must think carefully about the matter of interpretation, or how the explanations relate to intuitive questions that humans have about the world. The fact that this is scarcely being discussed in research papers is one of the main drawbacks of the current literature. Moving forward, the analogy between explainable machine learning and applied statistics suggests fruitful ways for how research practices can be improved.

Abstract: Invariant models, one important class of geometric deep learning models, are capable of generating meaningful geometric representations by leveraging informative geometric features in point clouds. These models are characterized by their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency. However, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting a deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we concentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of invariant models under fully-connected conditions. We first rigorously characterize the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model, message-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting its unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then prove that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph graph neural networks, can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and thus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we further prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph learning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with E(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established invariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness. Our theoretical results fill the gap in the expressive power of invariant models, contributing to a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.

Abstract: Traffic prediction has long been a focal and pivotal area in research, witnessing both significant strides from city-level to road-level predictions in recent years. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies, autonomous driving, and large-scale models in the traffic domain, lane-level traffic prediction has emerged as an indispensable direction. However, further progress in this field is hindered by the absence of comprehensive and unified evaluation standards, coupled with limited public availability of data and code. In this paper, we present the first systematic classification framework for lane-level traffic prediction, offering a structured taxonomy and analysis of existing methods. We construct three representative datasets from two real-world road networks, covering both regular and irregular lane configurations, and make them publicly available to support future research. We further establishes a unified spatial topology structure and prediction task formulation, and proposes a simple yet effective baseline model, GraphMLP, based on graph structure and MLP networks. This unified framework enables consistent evaluation across datasets and modeling paradigms. We also reproduce previously unavailable code from existing studies and conduct extensive experiments to assess a range of models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and applicability, providing the first benchmark that jointly considers predictive performance and training cost for lane-level traffic scenarios. All datasets and code are released at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/LaneLevel-Traffic-Benchmark.

Abstract: We study the problem of online sequential decision-making given auxiliary demonstrations from experts who made their decisions based on unobserved contextual information. These demonstrations can be viewed as solving related but slightly different problems than what the learner faces. This setting arises in many application domains, such as self-driving cars, healthcare, and finance, where expert demonstrations are made using contextual information, which is not recorded in the data available to the learning agent. We model the problem as zero-shot meta-reinforcement learning with an unknown distribution over the unobserved contextual variables and a Bayesian regret minimization objective, where the unobserved variables are encoded as parameters with an unknown prior. We propose the Experts-as-Priors algorithm (ExPerior), an empirical Bayes approach that utilizes expert data to establish an informative prior distribution over the learner's decision-making problem. This prior distribution enables the application of any Bayesian approach for online decision-making, such as posterior sampling. We demonstrate that our strategy surpasses existing behaviour cloning, online, and online-offline baselines for multi-armed bandits, Markov decision processes (MDPs), and partially observable MDPs, showcasing the broad reach and utility of ExPerior in using expert demonstrations across different decision-making setups.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have driven profound transformations in wireless networks. However, within wireless environments, the training of LLMs faces significant challenges related to security and privacy. Federated Learning (FL), with its decentralized architecture, offers enhanced data privacy protection. Nevertheless, when integrated with LLMs, FL still struggles with several critical limitations, including large-scale and heterogeneous data, resource-intensive training, and substantial communication overhead. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a systematic analysis of the distinct training stages of LLMs in wireless networks, including pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment tuning. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Personalized Wireless Federated Fine-tuning (PWFF) framework. Initially, we utilize the adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to decrease energy consumption, while employing global partial aggregation to reduce communication delay. Subsequently, we develop two reward models and design a personalized loss function to fulfill the goal of personalized learning. Furthermore, we implement a local multi-objective alignment to ensure the stability and effectiveness of the FL process. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations to validate the performance of the proposed PWFF method and provide an in-depth discussion of the open issues.

Abstract: In Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) agents are tasked with optimising decision-making behaviours that trade-off between multiple, possibly conflicting, objectives. MORL based on decomposition is a family of solution methods that employ a number of utility functions to decompose the multi-objective problem into individual single-objective problems solved simultaneously in order to approximate a Pareto front of policies. We focus on the case of linear utility functions parametrised by weight vectors w. We introduce a method based on Upper Confidence Bound to efficiently search for the most promising weight vectors during different stages of the learning process, with the aim of maximising the hypervolume of the resulting Pareto front. The proposed method demonstrates consistency and strong performance across various MORL baselines on Mujoco benchmark problems. The code is released in: https://github.com/SYCAMORE-1/ucb-MOPPO

Abstract: Wildfires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, wildlife, and human communities, leading to habitat destruction, pollutant emissions, and biodiversity loss. Accurate wildfire risk prediction is crucial for mitigating these impacts and safeguarding both environmental and human health. This paper provides a comprehensive review of wildfire risk prediction methodologies, with a particular focus on deep learning approaches combined with remote sensing. We begin by defining wildfire risk and summarizing the geographical distribution of related studies. In terms of data, we analyze key predictive features, including fuel characteristics, meteorological and climatic conditions, socioeconomic factors, topography, and hydrology, while also reviewing publicly available wildfire prediction datasets derived from remote sensing. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of feature collinearity assessment and model interpretability to improve the understanding of prediction outcomes. Regarding methodology, we classify deep learning models into three primary categories: time-series forecasting, image segmentation, and spatiotemporal prediction, and further discuss methods for converting model outputs into risk classifications or probability-adjusted predictions. Finally, we identify the key challenges and limitations of current wildfire-risk prediction models and outline several research opportunities. These include integrating diverse remote sensing data, developing multimodal models, designing more computationally efficient architectures, and incorporating cross-disciplinary methods--such as coupling with numerical weather-prediction models--to enhance the accuracy and robustness of wildfire-risk assessments.

Abstract: We develop a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework to jointly optimize wireless network selection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network operating on conventional sub-6GHz spectrum and Terahertz frequencies. The proposed framework is designed to 1. maximize the traffic flow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration), and 2. enhance the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while minimizing handoffs (HOs). We cast this problem as a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) and develop solutions for both predefined and unknown preferences of the conflicting objectives. Specifically, we develop a novel envelope MORL solution which develops policies that address multiple objectives with unknown preferences to the agent. While this approach reduces reliance on scalar rewards, policy effectiveness varying with different preferences is a challenge. To address this, we apply a generalized version of the Bellman equation and optimize the convex envelope of multi-objective Q values to learn a unified parametric representation capable of generating optimal policies across all possible preference configurations. Following an initial learning phase, our agent can execute optimal policies under any specified preference or infer preferences from minimal data samples. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the envelope-based MORL solution and demonstrate interesting insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle motion dynamics, HOs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to adopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity.

Abstract: Recent progress in Neural Causal Models (NCMs) showcased how identification and partial identification of causal effects can be automatically carried out via training of neural generative models that respect the constraints encoded in a given causal graph [Xia et al. 2022, Balazadeh et al. 2022]. However, formal consistency of these methods has only been proven for the case of discrete variables or only for linear causal models. In this work, we prove the consistency of partial identification via NCMs in a general setting with both continuous and categorical variables. Further, our results highlight the impact of the design of the underlying neural network architecture in terms of depth and connectivity as well as the importance of applying Lipschitz regularization in the training phase. In particular, we provide a counterexample showing that without Lipschitz regularization this method may not be asymptotically consistent. Our results are enabled by new results on the approximability of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) via neural generative models, together with an analysis of the sample complexity of the resulting architectures and how that translates into an error in the constrained optimization problem that defines the partial identification bounds.

Abstract: Determining the optimal model for a given task often requires training multiple models from scratch, which becomes impractical as dataset and model sizes grow. A more efficient alternative is to expand smaller pre-trained models, but this approach is underutilized due to a limited understanding of its impact on the training dynamics. Existing methods for quantifying this impact have notable limitations, including computation cost. To address this, we introduce a new perspective based on the loss landscape, which has been shown to contain a manifold of linearly connected minima. Specifically, we propose a metric that estimates the size of this manifold to study the impact of model expansion. Our experiments reveal a strong correlation between performance gains and our manifold metric, enabling more informed model comparison and offering a first step toward a geometry-driven approach for reliable model expansion. Notably, our metric outperforms other baselines, even when different types of expansion with equivalent number of parameters are applied to a model.

Abstract: Large autoregressive models like Transformers can solve tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without learning new weights, suggesting avenues for efficiently solving new tasks. For many tasks, e.g., linear regression, the data factorizes: examples are independent given a task latent that generates the data, e.g., linear coefficients. While an optimal predictor leverages this factorization by inferring task latents, it is unclear if Transformers implicitly do so or if they instead exploit heuristics and statistical shortcuts enabled by attention layers. Both scenarios have inspired active ongoing work. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of explicitly inferring task latents. We minimally modify the Transformer architecture with a bottleneck designed to prevent shortcuts in favor of more structured solutions, and then compare performance against standard Transformers across various ICL tasks. Contrary to intuition and some recent works, we find little discernible difference between the two; biasing towards task-relevant latent variables does not lead to better out-of-distribution performance, in general. Curiously, we find that while the bottleneck effectively learns to extract latent task variables from context, downstream processing struggles to utilize them for robust prediction. Our study highlights the intrinsic limitations of Transformers in achieving structured ICL solutions that generalize, and shows that while inferring the right latents aids interpretability, it is not sufficient to alleviate this problem.

Abstract: This paper focuses on extending the success of large language models (LLMs) to sequential decision making. Existing efforts either (i) re-train or finetune LLMs for decision making, or (ii) design prompts for pretrained LLMs. The former approach suffers from the computational burden of gradient updates, and the latter approach does not show promising results. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages online model selection algorithms to efficiently incorporate LLMs agents into sequential decision making. Statistically, our approach significantly outperforms both traditional decision making algorithms and vanilla LLM agents. Computationally, our approach avoids the need for expensive gradient updates of LLMs, and throughout the decision making process, it requires only a small number of LLM calls. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach. As an example, on a large-scale Amazon dataset, our approach achieves more than a 6x performance gain over baselines while calling LLMs in only 1.5% of the time steps.

Abstract: Clinical trials are pivotal for developing new medical treatments but typically carry risks such as patient mortality and enrollment failure that waste immense efforts spanning over a decade. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) to predict key events in clinical trials holds great potential for providing insights to guide trial designs. However, complex data collection and question definition requiring medical expertise have hindered the involvement of AI thus far. This paper tackles these challenges by presenting a comprehensive suite of 23 meticulously curated AI-ready datasets covering multi-modal input features and 8 crucial prediction challenges in clinical trial design, encompassing prediction of trial duration, patient dropout rate, serious adverse event, mortality rate, trial approval outcome, trial failure reason, drug dose finding, design of eligibility criteria. Furthermore, we provide basic validation methods for each task to ensure the datasets' usability and reliability. We anticipate that the availability of such open-access datasets will catalyze the development of advanced AI approaches for clinical trial design, ultimately advancing clinical trial research and accelerating medical solution development.

<title>Graph Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Resource Allocation for V2X Communications</title>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication has attracted much attention due to its superior performance in coverage, latency, and throughput. Resource allocation within C-V2X is crucial for ensuring the transmission of safety information and meeting the stringent requirements for ultra-low latency and high reliability in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. This paper proposes a method that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address this challenge. By constructing a dynamic graph with communication links as nodes and employing the Graph Sample and Aggregation (GraphSAGE) model to adapt to changes in graph structure, the model aims to ensure a high success rate for V2V communication while minimizing interference on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) links, thereby ensuring the successful transmission of V2V link information and maintaining high transmission rates for V2I links. The proposed method retains the global feature learning capabilities of GNN and supports distributed network deployment, allowing vehicles to extract low-dimensional features that include structural information from the graph network based on local observations and to make independent resource allocation decisions. Simulation results indicate that the introduction of GNN, with a modest increase in computational load, effectively enhances the decision-making quality of agents, demonstrating superiority to other methods. This study not only provides a theoretically efficient resource allocation strategy for V2V and V2I communications but also paves a new technical path for resource management in practical IoV environments.

Abstract: We present an optimistic Q-learning algorithm for regret minimization in average reward reinforcement learning under an additional assumption on the underlying MDP that for all policies, the time to visit some frequent state $s_0$ is finite and upper bounded by $H$, either in expectation or with constant probability. Our setting strictly generalizes the episodic setting and is significantly less restrictive than the assumption of bounded hitting time \textit{for all states} made by most previous literature on model-free algorithms in average reward settings. We demonstrate a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(H^5 S\sqrt{AT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, and $T$ is the horizon. A key technical novelty of our work is the introduction of an $\overline{L}$ operator defined as $\overline{L} v = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h=1}^H L^h v$ where $L$ denotes the Bellman operator. Under the given assumption, we show that the $\overline{L}$ operator has a strict contraction (in span) even in the average-reward setting where the discount factor is $1$. Our algorithm design uses ideas from episodic Q-learning to estimate and apply this operator iteratively. Thus, we provide a unified view of regret minimization in episodic and non-episodic settings, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Evaluating the contribution of individual data points to a model's prediction is critical for interpreting model predictions and improving model performance. Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and text; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains under-explored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a model-agnostic data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. By leveraging influence scores, TimeInf attributes model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures between the time points. Our empirical results show that TimeInf effectively detects time series anomalies and outperforms existing data attribution techniques as well as state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Moreover, TimeInf offers interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to distinguish diverse anomalous patterns through visualizations. We also showcase a potential application of TimeInf in identifying mislabeled anomalies in the ground truth annotations.

Abstract: Climate change stands as one of the most pressing global challenges of the twenty-first century, with far-reaching consequences such as rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and increasingly extreme weather patterns. Accurate forecasting is critical for monitoring these phenomena and supporting mitigation strategies. While recent data-driven models for time-series forecasting, including CNNs, RNNs, and attention-based transformers, have shown promise, they often struggle with sequential dependencies and limited parallelization, especially in long-horizon, multivariate meteorological datasets. In this work, we present Focal Modulated Attention Encoder (FATE), a novel transformer architecture designed for reliable multivariate time-series forecasting. Unlike conventional models, FATE introduces a tensorized focal modulation mechanism that explicitly captures spatiotemporal correlations in time-series data. We further propose two modulation scores that offer interpretability by highlighting critical environmental features influencing predictions. We benchmark FATE across seven diverse real-world datasets including ETTh1, ETTm2, Traffic, Weather5k, USA-Canada, Europe, and LargeST datasets, and show that it consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art methods, including temperature datasets. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that FATE generalizes well to broader multivariate time-series forecasting tasks. For reproducible research, code is released at https://github.com/Tajamul21/FATE.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques have garnered great interest in designing communication systems owing to their capacity in tackling with channel uncertainty. To provide theoretical guarantees for learning-based communication systems, some recent works analyze generalization bounds for devised methods based on the assumption of Independently and Identically Distributed (I.I.D.) channels, a condition rarely met in practical scenarios. In this paper, we drop the I.I.D. channel assumption and study an online optimization problem of learning to communicate over time-correlated channels. To address this issue, we further focus on two specific tasks: optimizing channel decoders for time-correlated fading channels and selecting optimal codebooks for time-correlated additive noise channels. For utilizing temporal dependence of considered channels to better learn communication systems, we develop two online optimization algorithms based on the optimistic online mirror descent framework. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for proposed algorithms via deriving sub-linear regret bound on the expected error probability of learned systems. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to validate that our presented approaches can leverage the channel correlation to achieve a lower average symbol error rate compared to baseline methods, consistent with our theoretical findings.

Abstract: We study the universal approximation properties of transformers and neural integral operators for operators in Banach spaces. In particular, we show that the transformer architecture is a universal approximator of integral operators between H\"older spaces. Moreover, we show that a generalized version of neural integral operators, based on the Gavurin integral, are universal approximators of arbitrary operators between Banach spaces. Lastly, we show that a modified version of transformer, which uses Leray-Schauder mappings, is a universal approximator of operators between arbitrary Banach spaces.

Abstract: Recently, the authors of \cite{SYZ22} developed a neural network with width $36d(2d + 1)$ and depth $11$, which utilizes a special activation function called the elementary universal activation function, to achieve the super approximation property for functions in $C([a,b]^d)$. That is, the constructed network only requires a fixed number of neurons (and thus parameters) to approximate a $d$-variate continuous function on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with arbitrary accuracy. More specifically, only $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ neurons or parameters are used. One natural question is whether we can reduce the number of these neurons or parameters in such a network. By leveraging a variant of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem, \textcolor{black}{we show that there is a composition of networks generated by the elementary universal activation function with at most $10889d + 10887$ nonzero parameters such that this super approximation property is attained. The composed network consists of repeated evaluations of two neural networks: one with width $36(2d+1)$ and the other with width 36, both having 5 layers.} Furthermore, we present a family of continuous functions that requires at least width $d$, and thus at least $d$ neurons or parameters, to achieve arbitrary accuracy in its approximation. This suggests that the number of nonzero parameters is optimal in the sense that it grows linearly with the input dimension $d$, unlike some approximation methods where parameters may grow exponentially with $d$.

Abstract: The leakage of benchmark data into the training data has emerged as a significant challenge for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we challenge the common assumption that small-scale contamination renders benchmark evaluations invalid. First, we experimentally quantify the magnitude of benchmark overfitting based on scaling along three dimensions: The number of model parameters (up to 1.6B), the number of times an example is seen (up to 144), and the number of training tokens (up to 40B). If model and data follow the Chinchilla scaling laws, minor contamination indeed leads to overfitting. At the same time, even 144 times of contamination can be forgotten if the training data is scaled beyond five times Chinchilla, a regime characteristic of many modern LLMs. Continual pre-training of OLMo-7B corroborates these results. Next, we study the impact of the weight decay parameter on example forgetting, showing that empirical forgetting occurs faster than the cumulative weight decay. This allows us to gauge the degree of example forgetting in large-scale training runs, indicating that many LLMs, including Lllama 3 405B, have forgotten the data seen at the beginning of training.

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular generative models have demonstrated great promise for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often struggle to generate high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to improve molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed.

Abstract: Graph generative models are essential across diverse scientific domains by capturing complex distributions over relational data. Among them, graph diffusion models achieve superior performance but face inefficient sampling and limited flexibility due to the tight coupling between training and sampling stages. We introduce DeFoG, a novel graph generative framework that disentangles sampling from training, enabling a broader design space for more effective and efficient model optimization. DeFoG employs a discrete flow-matching formulation that respects the inherent symmetries of graphs. We theoretically ground this disentangled formulation by explicitly relating the training loss to the sampling algorithm and showing that DeFoG faithfully replicates the ground truth graph distribution. Building on these foundations, we thoroughly investigate DeFoG's design space and propose novel sampling methods that significantly enhance performance and reduce the required number of refinement steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across synthetic, molecular, and digital pathology datasets, covering both unconditional and conditional generation settings. It also outperforms most diffusion-based models with just 5-10% of their sampling steps.

Abstract: Attention layers are the core component of transformers, the current state-of-the-art neural network architecture. Alternatives to softmax-based attention are being explored due to its tendency to hinder effective information flow. Even at initialisation, it remains poorly understood why the propagation of signals and gradients through these random networks can be pathological, resulting in issues known as (i) vanishing/exploding gradients and (ii) rank collapse $\textit{in depth}$, i.e. when all tokens converge to a single representation along layers. While rank collapse in depth naturally arises from repeated matrix multiplications$\unicode{x2013}$a common pattern across various architectures$\unicode{x2013}$we identify an additional and previously unknown challenge unique to softmax attention layers: (iii) rank collapse $\textit{in width}$, which occurs as the context length increases. Using Random Matrix Theory, we conduct a rigorous analysis that uncovers a spectral gap between the two largest singular values of the attention matrix as the cause of (iii), which in turn exacerbates (i) and (ii). Building on this insight, we propose a novel yet simple practical solution to mitigate rank collapse in width by removing the outlier eigenvalue(s). Our theoretical framework offers a fresh perspective on recent practical studies, such as (Ye et al., 2024; Ali et al., 2023), whose ad hoc solutions can now be interpreted as implicit efforts to address the spectral gap issue. This work provides valuable theoretical support for ongoing large-scale empirical research, bringing theory and practice one step closer in the understanding of transformers.

Abstract: Reliable estimation of predictive uncertainty is crucial for machine learning applications, particularly in high-stakes scenarios where hedging against risks is essential. Despite its significance, there is no universal agreement on how to best quantify predictive uncertainty. In this work, we revisit core concepts to propose a framework for information-theoretic measures of predictive uncertainty. Our proposed framework categorizes predictive uncertainty measures according to two factors: (I) The predicting model (II) The approximation of the true predictive distribution. Examining all possible combinations of these two factors, we derive a set of predictive uncertainty measures that includes both known and newly introduced ones. We extensively evaluate these measures across a broad set of tasks, identifying conditions under which certain measures excel. Our findings show the importance of aligning the choice of uncertainty measure with the predicting model on in-distribution (ID) data, the limitations of epistemic uncertainty measures for out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and that the disentanglement between measures varies substantially between ID and OOD data. Together, these insights provide a more comprehensive understanding of predictive uncertainty measures, revealing their implicit assumptions and relationships.

Abstract: Online Kernel Learning (OKL) has attracted considerable research interest due to its promising predictive performance in streaming environments. Second-order approaches are particularly appealing for OKL as they often offer substantial improvements in regret guarantees. However, existing second-order OKL approaches suffer from at least quadratic time complexity with respect to the pre-set budget, rendering them unsuitable for meeting the real-time demands of large-scale streaming recommender systems. The singular value decomposition required to obtain explicit feature mapping is also computationally expensive due to the complete decomposition process. Moreover, the absence of incremental updates to manage approximate kernel space causes these algorithms to perform poorly in adversarial environments and real-world streaming recommendation datasets. To address these issues, we propose FORKS, a fast incremental matrix sketching and decomposition approach tailored for second-order OKL. FORKS constructs an incremental maintenance paradigm for second-order kernelized gradient descent, which includes incremental matrix sketching for kernel approximation and incremental matrix decomposition for explicit feature mapping construction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that FORKS achieves a logarithmic regret guarantee on par with other second-order approaches while maintaining a linear time complexity w.r.t. the budget, significantly enhancing efficiency over existing approaches. We validate the performance of FORKS through extensive experiments conducted on real-world streaming recommendation datasets, demonstrating its superior scalability and robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have gained prominence for their ability to scale neural networks, particularly transformers, without a proportional increase in computational cost. Despite their success, their role in compositional generalization, i.e., adapting to novel combinations of known components, remains under-explored. This study challenges the assumption that minimal expert activation suffices for task generalization and investigates the relationship between task complexity and optimal sparsity in SMoE models. Through empirical evaluations on the SRAVEN symbolic reasoning task and the SKILL-MIX benchmark, we demonstrate that (i) the number of activated experts consistently increases with the perceived task difficulty to maintain performance; and (ii) the optimal number of activated experts scales proportionally with task complexity. Our theoretical analysis derives a scaling law for optimal sparsity by balancing approximation and estimation errors, revealing alignment with empirical observations. We formally show that the optimal sparsity lies between minimal activation (1-2 experts) and full activation, with the exact number scaling proportionally to task complexity and further influenced by the size of the training data and the complexity of the model. These findings offer practical insights for designing SMoE models that achieve computational efficiency while enabling robust compositional generalization.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of quantifying diversity for a set of objects. First, we conduct a systematic review of existing diversity measures and explore their undesirable behavior in certain cases. Based on this review, we formulate three desirable properties (axioms) of a reliable diversity measure: monotonicity, uniqueness, and continuity. We show that none of the existing measures has all three properties and thus these measures are not suitable for quantifying diversity. Then, we construct two examples of measures that have all the desirable properties, thus proving that the list of axioms is not self-contradictory. Unfortunately, the constructed examples are too computationally expensive (NP-hard) for practical use. Thus, we pose an open problem of constructing a diversity measure that has all the listed properties and can be computed in practice or proving that all such measures are NP-hard to compute.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. While numerous successful adversarial attacks have been proposed, defenses against these attacks remain relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches either focus on negating the effects of perturbations caused by the attacks to restore the DNNs' original predictions or use a secondary model to detect adversarial examples. However, these methods often become ineffective due to the continuous advancements in attack techniques. We propose a novel universal and lightweight method to detect adversarial examples by analyzing the layer outputs of DNNs. Our method trains a lightweight regression model that predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the prediction error to detect adversarial samples. Through theoretical justification and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly effective, compatible with any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image, video, and audio.

Abstract: As language models (LMs) approach human-level performance, a comprehensive understanding of their behavior becomes crucial. This includes evaluating capabilities, biases, task performance, and alignment with societal values. Extensive initial evaluations, including red teaming and diverse benchmarking, can establish a model's behavioral profile. However, subsequent fine-tuning or deployment modifications may alter these behaviors in unintended ways. We present a method for continual Behavioral Shift Auditing (BSA) in LMs. Building on recent work in hypothesis testing, our auditing test detects behavioral shifts solely through model generations. Our test compares model generations from a baseline model to those of the model under scrutiny and provides theoretical guarantees for change detection while controlling false positives. The test features a configurable tolerance parameter that adjusts sensitivity to behavioral changes for different use cases. We evaluate our approach using two case studies: monitoring changes in (a) toxicity and (b) translation performance. We find that the test is able to detect meaningful changes in behavior distributions using just hundreds of examples.

Abstract: The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. Training from scratch consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the entire PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality and also generate candidate membrane permeable molecules.

Abstract: Humans excel at learning abstract patterns across different sequences, filtering out irrelevant details, and transferring these generalized concepts to new sequences. In contrast, many sequence learning models lack the ability to abstract, which leads to memory inefficiency and poor transfer. We introduce a non-parametric hierarchical variable learning model (HVM) that learns chunks from sequences and abstracts contextually similar chunks as variables. HVM efficiently organizes memory while uncovering abstractions, leading to compact sequence representations. When learning on language datasets such as babyLM, HVM learns a more efficient dictionary than standard compression algorithms such as Lempel-Ziv. In a sequence recall task requiring the acquisition and transfer of variables embedded in sequences, we demonstrate HVM's sequence likelihood correlates with human recall times. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) struggle to transfer abstract variables as effectively as humans. From HVM's adjustable layer of abstraction, we demonstrate that the model realizes a precise trade-off between compression and generalization. Our work offers a cognitive model that captures the learning and transfer of abstract representations in human cognition and differentiates itself from LLMs.

<title>Mind Your Step (by Step): Chain-of-Thought can Reduce Performance on Tasks where Thinking Makes Humans Worse</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for improving large language and multimodal model performance. However, it is still an open question under which settings CoT systematically reduces performance. In this paper, we seek to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, focusing on six representative tasks from the psychological literature where deliberation hurts performance in humans. In three of these tasks, state-of-the-art models exhibit significant performance drop-offs with CoT (up to 36.3\% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o), while in others, CoT effects are mixed, with positive, neutral, and negative changes. While models and humans do not exhibit perfectly parallel cognitive processes, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for humans helps identify settings where it negatively impacts models. By connecting the literature on human verbal thinking and deliberation with evaluations of CoT, we offer a perspective for understanding the impact of inference-time reasoning.

<title>FAIR-TAT: Improving Model Fairness Using Targeted Adversarial Training</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks and common corruptions, which undermine their robustness. In order to enhance model resilience against such challenges, Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a prominent solution. Nevertheless, adversarial robustness is often attained at the expense of model fairness during AT, i.e., disparity in class-wise robustness of the model. While distinctive classes become more robust towards such adversaries, hard to detect classes suffer. Recently, research has focused on improving model fairness specifically for perturbed images, overlooking the accuracy of the most likely non-perturbed data. Additionally, despite their robustness against the adversaries encountered during model training, state-of-the-art adversarial trained models have difficulty maintaining robustness and fairness when confronted with diverse adversarial threats or common corruptions. In this work, we address the above concerns by introducing a novel approach called Fair Targeted Adversarial Training (FAIR-TAT). We show that using targeted adversarial attacks for adversarial training (instead of untargeted attacks) can allow for more favorable trade-offs with respect to adversarial fairness. Empirical results validate the efficacy of our approach.

<title>Fixing the Loose Brake: Exponential-Tailed Stopping Time in Best Arm Identification</title>

Abstract: The best arm identification problem requires identifying the best alternative (i.e., arm) in active experimentation using the smallest number of experiments (i.e., arm pulls), which is crucial for cost-efficient and timely decision-making processes. In the fixed confidence setting, an algorithm must stop data-dependently and return the estimated best arm with a correctness guarantee. Since this stopping time is random, we desire its distribution to have light tails. Unfortunately, many existing studies focus on high probability or in expectation bounds on the stopping time, which allow heavy tails and, for high probability bounds, even not stopping at all. We first prove that this never-stopping event can indeed happen for some popular algorithms. Motivated by this, we propose algorithms that provably enjoy an exponential-tailed stopping time, which improves upon the polynomial tail bound reported by Kalyanakrishnan et al. (2012). The first algorithm is based on a fixed budget algorithm called Sequential Halving along with a doubling trick. The second algorithm is a meta algorithm that takes in any fixed confidence algorithm with a high probability stopping guarantee and turns it into one that enjoys an exponential-tailed stopping time. Our results imply that there is much more to be desired for contemporary fixed confidence algorithms.

Abstract: Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions, to map observational time series to latent representations. Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability. Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data. An implementation of SPACY is available at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/SPACY/

<title>Regular-pattern-sensitive CRFs for Distant Label Interactions</title>

Abstract: While LLMs have grown popular in sequence labeling, linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) remain a popular alternative with the ability to directly model interactions between labels. However, the Markov assumption limits them to % only directly modeling interactions between adjacent labels. Weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs), in contrast, can model distant label--label interactions, but exact label inference is intractable in general. In this work, we present regular-pattern-sensitive CRFs (RPCRFs), a method of enriching standard linear-chain CRFs with the ability to learn long-distance label interactions through user-specified patterns. This approach allows users to write regular-expression label patterns concisely specifying which types of interactions the model should take into account, allowing the model to learn from data whether and in which contexts these patterns occur. The result can be interpreted alternatively as a CRF augmented with additional, non-local potentials, or as a finite-state transducer whose structure is defined by a set of easily-interpretable patterns. Critically, exact training and inference are tractable for many pattern sets. We detail how an RPCRF can be automatically constructed from a set of user-specified patterns, and demonstrate the model's effectiveness on a sequence of three synthetic sequence modeling datasets.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to automatically uncover causal relationships from data, a capability with significant potential across many scientific disciplines. However, its real-world applications remain limited. Current methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions and are evaluated only on simple synthetic toy datasets, often with inadequate evaluation metrics. In this paper, we substantiate these claims by performing a systematic review of the recent causal discovery literature. We present applications in biology, neuroscience, and Earth sciences - fields where causal discovery holds promise for addressing key challenges. We highlight available simulated and real-world datasets from these domains and discuss common assumption violations that have spurred the development of new methods. Our goal is to encourage the community to adopt better evaluation practices by utilizing realistic datasets and more adequate metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/sjtu-zhao-lab/ClusterKV.

Abstract: Shortcut learning, i.e., a model's reliance on undesired features not directly relevant to the task, is a major challenge that severely limits the applications of machine learning algorithms, particularly when deploying them to assist in making sensitive decisions, such as in medical diagnostics. In this work, we leverage recent advancements in machine learning to create an unsupervised framework that is capable of both detecting and mitigating shortcut learning in transformers. We validate our method on multiple datasets. Results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both worst-group accuracy (samples misclassified due to shortcuts) and average accuracy, while minimizing human annotation effort. Moreover, we demonstrate that the detected shortcuts are meaningful and informative to human experts, and that our framework is computationally efficient, allowing it to be run on consumer hardware.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technology enables information exchange between vehicles and road infrastructure. Specifically, when a vehicle approaches a roadside unit (RSU), it can exchange information with the RSU to obtain accurate data that assists in driving. With the release of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 16, which includes the 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) standards, vehicles typically adopt mode-2 communication using sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) for resource allocation. In this approach, vehicles identify candidate resources within a selection window and exclude ineligible resources based on information from a sensing window. However, vehicles often drive at different speeds, resulting in varying amounts of data transmission with RSUs as they pass by, which leads to unfair access. Therefore, it is essential to design an access scheme that accounts for different vehicle speeds to achieve fair access across the network. This paper formulates an optimization problem for vehicular networks and proposes a multi-objective optimization scheme to address it by adjusting the selection window in the SPS mechanism of 5G NR V2I mode-2. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme

Abstract: Designing learning agents that explore efficiently in a complex environment has been widely recognized as a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While a number of works have demonstrated the effectiveness of techniques based on randomized value functions on a single agent, it remains unclear, from a theoretical point of view, whether injecting randomization can help a society of agents {\it concurently} explore an environment. The theoretical results %that we established in this work tender an affirmative answer to this question. We adapt the concurrent learning framework to \textit{randomized least-squares value iteration} (RLSVI) with \textit{aggregated state representation}. We demonstrate polynomial worst-case regret bounds in both finite- and infinite-horizon environments. In both setups the per-agent regret decreases at an optimal rate of $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$, highlighting the advantage of concurent learning. Our algorithm exhibits significantly lower space complexity compared to \cite{russo2019worst} and \cite{agrawal2021improved}. We reduce the space complexity by a factor of $K$ while incurring only a $\sqrt{K}$ increase in the worst-case regret bound, compared to \citep{agrawal2021improved,russo2019worst}. Additionally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling the modeling of students' knowledge states to predict future performance. The introduction of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), the first deep learning-based KT (DLKT) model, has brought significant advantages in terms of applicability and comprehensiveness. However, recent DLKT models, such as Attentive Knowledge Tracing (AKT), have often prioritized predictive performance at the expense of these benefits. While deep sequential models like DKT have shown potential, they face challenges related to parallel computing, storage decision modification, and limited storage capacity. To address these limitations, we propose DKT2, a novel KT model that leverages the recently developed xLSTM architecture. DKT2 enhances applicable input representation using the Rasch model and incorporates Item Response Theory (IRT) for output interpretability, allowing for the decomposition of learned knowledge into familiar and unfamiliar knowledge. By integrating this knowledge with predicted questions, DKT2 generates comprehensive knowledge states. Extensive experiments conducted across three large-scale datasets demonstrate that DKT2 consistently outperforms 18 baseline models in various prediction tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world educational applications. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementation in KT. Our code and datasets are fully available at https://github.com/zyy-2001/DKT2.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the computation of PDE solutions by integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network's training process as soft constraints, becoming an important component of the scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem. More recently, physics-informed Kolmogorv-Arnold networks (PIKANs) have also shown to be effective and comparable in accuracy with PINNs. In their current implementation, both PINNs and PIKANs are mainly optimized using first-order methods like Adam, as well as quasi-Newton methods such as BFGS and its low-memory variant, L-BFGS. However, these optimizers often struggle with highly non-linear and non-convex loss landscapes, leading to challenges such as slow convergence, local minima entrapment, and (non)degenerate saddle points. In this study, we investigate the performance of Self-Scaled BFGS (SSBFGS), Self-Scaled Broyden (SSBroyden) methods and other advanced quasi-Newton schemes, including BFGS and L-BFGS with different line search strategies approaches. These methods dynamically rescale updates based on historical gradient information, thus enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. We systematically compare these optimizers -- using both PINNs and PIKANs -- on key challenging linear, stiff, multi-scale and non-linear PDEs, including the Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Ginzburg-Landau equations. Our findings provide state-of-the-art results with orders-of-magnitude accuracy improvements without the use of adaptive weights or any other enhancements typically employed in PINNs. More broadly, our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of second-order optimization strategies in significantly improving the convergence and accurate generalization of PINNs and PIKANs.

Abstract: Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved promising results in solving online 3D Bin Packing Problems (3D-BPP). However, these DRL-based policies may perform poorly on new instances due to distribution shift. Besides generalization, we also consider adaptation, completely overlooked by previous work, which aims at rapidly fine-tuning these policies to a new test distribution. To tackle both generalization and adaptation issues, we propose ASAP, which decomposes a solver's decision-making into two policies, one for proposal and one for selection. The role of the proposal policy is to suggest promising actions, which allows the selection policy to choose among them. To effectively learn these policies, we introduce a training framework that combines pre-training and post-training, enhanced by meta-learning. During online adaptation, we only fine-tune the selection policy to rapidly adapt to a test distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that ASAP exhibits excellent generalization and adaptation capabilities on in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances for both discrete and continuous setups.

Abstract: World models represent a promising approach for training reinforcement learning agents with significantly improved sample efficiency. While most world model methods primarily rely on sequences of discrete latent variables to model environment dynamics, this compression often neglects critical visual details essential for reinforcement learning. Recent diffusion-based world models condition generation on a fixed context length of frames to predict the next observation, using separate recurrent neural networks to model rewards and termination signals. Although this architecture effectively enhances visual fidelity, the fixed context length approach inherently limits memory capacity. In this paper, we introduce EDELINE, a unified world model architecture that integrates state space models with diffusion models. Our approach outperforms existing baselines across visually challenging Atari 100k tasks, memory-demanding Crafter benchmark, and 3D first-person ViZDoom environments, demonstrating superior performance in all these diverse challenges.

Abstract: Plasticity loss, a critical challenge in neural network training, limits a model's ability to adapt to new tasks or shifts in data distribution. This paper introduces AID (Activation by Interval-wise Dropout), a novel method inspired by Dropout, designed to address plasticity loss. Unlike Dropout, AID generates subnetworks by applying Dropout with different probabilities on each preactivation interval. Theoretical analysis reveals that AID regularizes the network, promoting behavior analogous to that of deep linear networks, which do not suffer from plasticity loss. We validate the effectiveness of AID in maintaining plasticity across various benchmarks, including continual learning tasks on standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we show that AID enhances reinforcement learning performance in the Arcade Learning Environment benchmark.

Abstract: Sample inefficiency is a long-lasting challenge in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Despite dramatic improvements have been made, the problem is far from being solved and is especially challenging in environments with sparse or delayed rewards. In our work, we propose to use Adversarial Estimates as a new, simple and efficient approach to mitigate this problem for a class of feedback-based DRL algorithms. Our approach leverages latent similarity search from a small set of human-collected trajectories to boost learning, using only five minutes of human-recorded experience. The results of our study show algorithms trained with Adversarial Estimates converge faster than their original version. Moreover, we discuss how our approach could enable learning in feedback-based algorithms in extreme scenarios with very sparse rewards.

Abstract: From extracting features to generating text, the outputs of large language models (LLMs) typically rely on the final layers, following the conventional wisdom that earlier layers capture only low-level cues. However, our analysis shows that intermediate layers can encode even richer representations, often improving performance on a range of downstream tasks. To explain and quantify these hidden-layer properties, we propose a unified framework of representation quality metrics based on information theory, geometry, and invariance to input perturbations. Our framework highlights how each layer balances information compression and signal preservation, revealing why mid-depth embeddings can exceed the last layer's performance. Through extensive experiments on 32 text-embedding tasks across various architectures (transformers, state-space models) and domains (language, vision), we demonstrate that intermediate layers consistently provide stronger features, challenging the standard view on final-layer embeddings and opening new directions on using mid-layer representations for more robust and accurate representations.

Abstract: We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive, often requiring months of training time even with high-end GPU clusters. There are two approaches of mitigating such computational demands: reusing smaller models to train larger ones (upcycling), and training computationally efficient models like mixture-of-experts (MoE). In this paper, we study the upcycling of LLMs to MoE models, of which the scaling behavior remains underexplored. Through extensive experiments, we identify empirical scaling laws that describe how performance depends on dataset size and model configuration. Particularly, we show that, while scaling these factors improves performance, there is a novel interaction term between the dense and upcycled training dataset that limits the efficiency of upcycling at large computational budgets. Based on these findings, we provide guidance to scale upcycling, and establish conditions under which upcycling outperforms from-scratch trainings within budget constraints.

Abstract: It is often observed that the aggregated model in FL underperforms on local data until after several rounds of local training. This temporary performance drop can potentially slow down the convergence of the FL model. Prior work regards this performance drop as an inherent cost of knowledge sharing among clients and does not give it special attention. While some studies directly focus on designing techniques to alleviate the issue, its root causes remain poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we construct a framework that enables layer-peeled analysis of how feature representations evolve during model aggregation in FL. It focuses on two key aspects: (1) the intrinsic quality of extracted features, and (2) the alignment between features and their subsequent parameters -- both of which are critical to downstream performance. Using this framework, we first investigate how model aggregation affects internal feature extraction process. Our analysis reveals that aggregation degrades feature quality and weakens the coupling between intermediate features and subsequent layers, both of which are well shaped during local training. More importantly, this degradation is not confined to specific layers but progressively accumulates with network depth -- a phenomenon we term Cumulative Feature Degradation (CFD). CFD significantly impairs the quality of penultimate-layer features and weakens their coupling with the classifier, ultimately degrading model performance. We further revisit several widely adopted solutions through the lens of layer-peeled feature extraction to understand why they are effective in addressing aggregation-induced performance drop. Our results show that their effectiveness lies in mitigating the feature degradation described above, which is well aligned with our observations.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their broad range of applications in edge devices. To obtain SLMs with strong performance, conventional approaches either pre-train the models from scratch, which incurs substantial computational costs, or compress/prune existing large language models (LLMs), which results in performance drops and falls short in comparison to pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both structured pruning and model training. We found 1) layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner) is extremely effective in LLMs and yields significant improvements over existing pruning techniques, 2) adaptive pruning equipped with further training leads to models comparable to those pre-training from scratch, 3) incremental pruning brings non-trivial performance gain by interleaving pruning with training and only removing a small portion of neurons ($\sim$5%) at a time. Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner, FLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense benchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of MobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\times$ fewer tokens via pruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that surpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks. The official code is released at https://github.com/research4pan/AdaptPruner.

Abstract: As the Internet of Things (IoT) expands rapidly, ensuring secure networks to defend against diverse cyber threats becomes increasingly vital. This study addresses the limitations of multi-class attack detection in IoT devices by proposing new, lightweight ensemble methods grounded in robust machine learning frameworks. Leveraging the CICIoT 2023 dataset which features 34 distinct attack types across 10 categories. We systematically evaluated a wide array of contemporary machine learning algorithms to identify the optimal choice for safeguarding IoT environments. Focusing on classifier-based approaches, our research addresses the complex and heterogeneous nature of attack vectors found in IoT ecosystems. Among the evaluated models, the Decision Tree classifier achieved the highest performance, with 99.56\% accuracy and a 99.62\% F1 score, demonstrating strong, reliable threat detection capabilities. The Random Forest algorithm followed closely, attaining 98.22\% accuracy and a 98.24\% F1 score, further highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning in handling high-dimensional data. These findings underscore the significant promise of incorporating machine learning classifiers into IoT security defenses and inspire further exploration into scalable, keystroke-based attack detection. Our approach offers a novel pathway for developing sophisticated algorithms for resource-constrained IoT devices, achieving a critical balance between accuracy and efficiency. Overall, this work advances the field of IoT security by establishing a strong baseline and framework for the development of intelligent, adaptive security measures suitable for evolving IoT landscapes.

Abstract: Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.

<title>Speeding up Speculative Decoding via Sequential Approximate Verification</title>

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a recently proposed technique for faster inference using Large Language Models (LLMs). SD operates by using a smaller draft LLM for autoregressively generating a sequence of tokens and a larger target LLM for parallel verification to ensure statistical consistency. However, periodic parallel calls to the target LLM for verification prevent SD from achieving even lower latencies. We propose SPRINTER, which utilizes a low-complexity verifier trained to predict if tokens generated from a draft LLM would be accepted by the target LLM. By performing sequential approximate verification, SPRINTER does not require verification by the target LLM and is only invoked when a token is deemed unacceptable. This reduces the number of calls to the larger LLM, achieving further speedups and lower computation cost. We present a theoretical analysis of SPRINTER, examining the statistical properties of the generated tokens, as well as the expected reduction in latency as a function of the verifier. We evaluate SPRINTER on several datasets and model pairs, demonstrating that approximate verification can still maintain high quality generation while further reducing latency.

Abstract: Multi-sample aggregation strategies, such as majority voting and best-of-N sampling, are widely used in contemporary large language models (LLMs) to enhance predictive accuracy across various tasks. A key challenge in this process is temperature selection, which significantly impacts model performance. Existing approaches either rely on a fixed default temperature or require labeled validation data for tuning, which are often scarce and difficult to obtain. This paper addresses the challenge of automatically identifying the (near)-optimal temperature for different LLMs using multi-sample aggregation strategies, without relying on task-specific validation data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of temperature's role in performance optimization, considering variations in model architectures, datasets, task types, model sizes, and predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a novel entropy-based metric for automated temperature optimization, which consistently outperforms fixed-temperature baselines. Additionally, we incorporate a stochastic process model to enhance interpretability, offering deeper insights into the relationship between temperature and model performance.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) seek to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with deep learning. Mainstream approaches that deploy fully-connected multi-layer deep learning architectures require prolonged training to achieve even moderate accuracy, while recent work on feature engineering allows higher accuracy and faster convergence. This paper introduces SAFE-NET, a Single-layered Adaptive Feature Engineering NETwork that achieves orders-of-magnitude lower errors with far fewer parameters than baseline feature engineering methods. SAFE-NET returns to basic ideas in machine learning, using Fourier features, a simplified single hidden layer network architecture, and an effective optimizer that improves the conditioning of the PINN optimization problem. Numerical results show that SAFE-NET converges faster and typically outperforms deeper networks and more complex architectures. It consistently uses fewer parameters -- on average, 65% fewer than the competing feature engineering methods -- while achieving comparable accuracy in less than 30% of the training epochs. Moreover, each SAFE-NET epoch is 95% faster than those of competing feature engineering approaches. These findings challenge the prevailing belief that modern PINNs effectively learn features in these scientific applications and highlight the efficiency gains possible through feature engineering.

Abstract: The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.

Abstract: While financial data presents one of the most challenging and interesting sequence modelling tasks due to high noise, heavy tails, and strategic interactions, progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of consensus on quantitative evaluation paradigms. To address this, we present LOB-Bench, a benchmark, implemented in python, designed to evaluate the quality and realism of generative message-by-order data for limit order books (LOB) in the LOBSTER format. Our framework measures distributional differences in conditional and unconditional statistics between generated and real LOB data, supporting flexible multivariate statistical evaluation. The benchmark also includes features commonly used LOB statistics such as spread, order book volumes, order imbalance, and message inter-arrival times, along with scores from a trained discriminator network. Lastly, LOB-Bench contains "market impact metrics", i.e. the cross-correlations and price response functions for specific events in the data. We benchmark generative autoregressive state-space models, a (C)GAN, as well as a parametric LOB model and find that the autoregressive GenAI approach beats traditional model classes.

Abstract: Representation learning produces models in different domains, such as store purchases, client transactions, and general people's behaviour. However, such models for event sequences usually process each sequence in isolation, ignoring context from ones that co-occur in time. This limitation is particularly problematic in domains with fast-evolving conditions, like finance and e-commerce, or when certain sequences lack recent events.
  We develop a method that aggregates information from multiple user representations, augmenting a specific user for a scenario of multiple co-occurring event sequences, achieving better quality than processing each sequence independently. Our study considers diverse aggregation approaches, ranging from simple pooling techniques to trainable attention-based Kernel attention aggregation, that can highlight more complex information flow from other users. The proposed methods operate on top of an existing encoder and support its efficient fine-tuning. Across six diverse event sequence datasets (finance, e-commerce, education, etc.) and downstream tasks, Kernel attention improves ROC-AUC scores, both with and without fine-tuning, while mean pooling yields a smaller but still significant gain.

Abstract: While increasing training compute has significantly improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), similar gains have not been observed when scaling inference compute. We hypothesize that the primary issue lies in the uniformity of LLM outputs, which leads to inefficient sampling as models repeatedly generate similar but inaccurate responses. Motivated by an intriguing relationship between solution accuracy and response diversity, we propose DivSampling -- a novel and versatile sampling technique designed to enhance the diversity of candidate solutions by introducing prompt perturbations.DivSampling incorporates two categories of perturbations: task-agnostic approaches, which are general and not tailored to any specific task, and task-specific approaches, which are customized based on task content. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the error rates of responses generated from diverse prompts are significantly lower compared to those produced by stationary prompts. Comprehensive evaluations across various tasks -- including reasoning, mathematics, and code generation -- highlight the effectiveness of DivSampling in improving solution accuracy. This scalable and efficient approach offers a new perspective on optimizing test-time inference, addressing limitations in current sampling strategies.

<title>Exploiting Task Relationships for Continual Learning Using Transferability-Aware Task Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has been a critical topic in contemporary deep neural network applications, where higher levels of both forward and backward transfer are desirable for an effective CL performance. Existing CL strategies primarily focus on task models, either by regularizing model updates or by separating task-specific and shared components, while often overlooking the potential of leveraging inter-task relationships to enhance transfer. To address this gap, we propose a transferability-aware task embedding, termed H-embedding, and construct a hypernet framework under its guidance to learn task-conditioned model weights for CL tasks. Specifically, H-embedding is derived from an information theoretic measure of transferability and is designed to be online and easy to compute. Our method is also characterized by notable practicality, requiring only the storage of a low-dimensional task embedding per task and supporting efficient end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and DomainNet show that our framework performs prominently compared to various baseline and SOTA approaches, demonstrating strong potential in capturing and utilizing intrinsic task relationships. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/H-embedding_guided_hypernet/.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has demonstrated effectiveness in solving NP-complete (NPC) problems by learning discrete diffusion models for solution generation, eliminating hand-crafted domain knowledge. Despite their success, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in both cross-scale and cross-problem generalization, and high training costs compared to traditional solvers. While recent studies on diffusion models have introduced training-free guidance approaches that leverage pre-defined guidance functions for conditional generation, such methodologies have not been extensively explored in combinatorial optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free inference time adaptation framework (DIFU-Ada) that enables both the zero-shot cross-problem transfer and cross-scale generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical analysis that helps understanding the cross-problem transfer capability. Our experimental results demonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance across different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in question answering (QA), but metrics for assessing their reliance on memorization versus retrieval remain underdeveloped. Moreover, while finetuned models are state-of-the-art on closed-domain tasks, general-purpose models like GPT-4o exhibit strong zero-shot performance. This raises questions about the trade-offs between memorization, generalization, and retrieval. In this work, we analyze the extent to which multimodal retrieval-augmented VLMs memorize training data compared to baseline VLMs. Using the WebQA benchmark, we contrast finetuned models with baseline VLMs on multihop retrieval and question answering, examining the impact of finetuning on data memorization. To quantify memorization in end-to-end retrieval and QA systems, we propose several proxy metrics by investigating instances where QA succeeds despite retrieval failing. In line with existing work, we find that finetuned models rely more heavily on memorization than retrieval-augmented VLMs, and achieve higher accuracy as a result (72% vs 52% on WebQA test set). Finally, we present the first empirical comparison of the parametric effect between text and visual modalities. Here, we find that image-based questions have parametric response rates that are consistently 15-25% higher than for text-based questions in the WebQA dataset. As such, our measures pose a challenge for future work, both to account for differences in model memorization across different modalities and more generally to reconcile memorization and generalization in joint Retrieval-QA tasks.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection. Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO training. To further mitigate the noise in different reward models, we propose a Bayesian Aggregation approach that unifies multiple margin sources (external and implicit) into a single preference probability. Extensive experiments in diverse settings demonstrate the consistently high data efficiency of our approach. Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama, Mistral, and Qwen models on the AlpacaEval2 benchmark. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data, revealing the high redundancy in this presumed high-quality data construction manner. These results highlight the potential of data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.

Abstract: The primary goal of reinforcement learning is to develop decision-making policies that prioritize optimal performance, frequently without considering safety. In contrast, safe reinforcement learning seeks to reduce or avoid unsafe behavior. This paper views safety as taking actions with more predictable consequences under environment stochasticity and introduces a temporal difference algorithm that uses optimal transport theory to quantify the uncertainty associated with actions. By integrating this uncertainty score into the decision-making objective, the agent is encouraged to favor actions with more predictable outcomes. We theoretically prove that our algorithm leads to a reduction in the probability of visiting unsafe states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on several case studies in the presence of various forms of environment uncertainty. The results demonstrate that our method not only provides safer behavior but also maintains the performance. A Python implementation of our algorithm is available at \href{https://github.com/SAILRIT/Risk-averse-TD-Learning}{https://github.com/SAILRIT/OT-guided-TD-Learning}.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem (KAT), or more generally, the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST), establishes that any non-linear multivariate function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of non-linear univariate functions. Unlike the universal approximation theorem, which provides only an approximate representation without guaranteeing a fixed network size, KST offers a theoretically exact decomposition. The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) was introduced as a trainable model to implement KAT, and recent advancements have adapted KAN using concepts from modern neural networks. However, KAN struggles to effectively model physical systems that require inherent equivariance or invariance geometric symmetries as $E(3)$ transformations, a key property for many scientific and engineering applications. In this work, we propose a novel extension of KAT and KAN to incorporate equivariance and invariance over various group actions, including $O(n)$, $O(1,n)$, $S_n$, and general $GL$, enabling accurate and efficient modeling of these systems. Our approach provides a unified approach that bridges the gap between mathematical theory and practical architectures for physical systems, expanding the applicability of KAN to a broader class of problems. We provide experimental validation on molecular dynamical systems and particle physics.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (\texttt{DPO}) has emerged as a promising approach for solving the alignment problem in AI. In this paper, we make two counter-intuitive observations about \texttt{DPO}. First, we show that \texttt{DPO} loss could be derived by starting from an alternative optimization problem that only defines the KL guardrail on in-sample responses, unlike the original RLHF problem where guardrails are defined on the entire distribution. Second, we prove a surprising property of this alternative optimization problem, namely that under its optimal policy, both preferred and rejected responses tend to decrease in probability, a phenomenon typically displayed by DPO in practice. To control this behavior, we propose a set of constraints designed to limit the displacement of probability mass between the preferred and rejected responses in the reference and target policies. The resulting algorithm, which we call Constrained Controlled DPO (\texttt{C2-DPO}), has a meaningful RLHF interpretation. By hedging against the displacement, \texttt{C2-DPO} provides practical improvements over vanilla \texttt{DPO} when aligning several language models using standard preference datasets.

Abstract: Large-scale machine learning models deliver strong performance across a wide range of tasks but come with significant computational and resource constraints. To mitigate these challenges, local smaller models are often deployed alongside larger models, relying on routing and deferral mechanisms to offload complex tasks. However, existing approaches inadequately balance the capabilities of these models, often resulting in unnecessary deferrals or sub-optimal resource usage. In this work we introduce a novel loss function called Gatekeeper for calibrating smaller models in cascade setups. Our approach fine-tunes the smaller model to confidently handle tasks it can perform correctly while deferring complex tasks to the larger model. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism for managing the trade-off between model performance and deferral accuracy, and is broadly applicable across various tasks and domains without any architectural changes. We evaluate our method on encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures. Experiments across image classification, language modeling, and vision-language tasks show that our approach substantially improves deferral performance.

Abstract: Traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods often struggle with sharp curvatures, intricate geometries, and multimodal distributions. Slice sampling can resolve local exploration inefficiency issues, and Riemannian geometries help with sharp curvatures. Recent extensions enable slice sampling on Riemannian manifolds, but they are restricted to cases where geodesics are available in a closed form. We propose a method that generalizes Hit-and-Run slice sampling to more general geometries tailored to the target distribution, by approximating geodesics as solutions to differential equations. Our approach enables the exploration of the regions with strong curvature and rapid transitions between modes in multimodal distributions. We demonstrate the advantages of the approach over challenging sampling problems.

Abstract: Divergence-free symmetric tensors (DFSTs) are fundamental in continuum mechanics, encoding conservation laws such as mass and momentum conservation. We introduce Riemann Tensor Neural Networks (RTNNs), a novel neural architecture that inherently satisfies the DFST condition to machine precision, providing a strong inductive bias for enforcing these conservation laws. We prove that RTNNs can approximate any sufficiently smooth DFST with arbitrary precision and demonstrate their effectiveness as surrogates for conservative PDEs, achieving improved accuracy across benchmarks. This work is the first to use DFSTs as an inductive bias in neural PDE surrogates and to explicitly enforce the conservation of both mass and momentum within a physics-constrained neural architecture.

Abstract: Machine learning systems struggle with robustness, under subpopulation shifts. This problem becomes especially pronounced in scenarios where only a subset of attribute combinations is observed during training -a severe form of subpopulation shift, referred as compositional shift. To address this problem, we ask the following question: Can we improve the robustness by training on synthetic data, spanning all possible attribute combinations? We first show that training of conditional diffusion models on limited data lead to incorrect underlying distribution. Therefore, synthetic data sampled from such models will result in unfaithful samples and does not lead to improve performance of downstream machine learning systems. To address this problem, we propose CoInD to reflect the compositional nature of the world by enforcing conditional independence through minimizing Fisher's divergence between joint and marginal distributions. We demonstrate that synthetic data generated by CoInD is faithful and this translates to state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy on compositional shift tasks on CelebA.

Abstract: Water quality is foundational to environmental sustainability, ecosystem resilience, and public health. Deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, offer transformative potential for large-scale water quality prediction and scientific insights generation. However, their widespread adoption in high-stakes decision-making, such as pollution mitigation and equitable resource allocation, is prevented by unresolved trustworthiness challenges including fairness, uncertainty, interpretability, robustness, generalizability, and reproducibility. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of trustworthiness in a continental-scale multi-task LSTM model predicting 20 water quality variables (encompassing physical/chemical processes, geochemical weathering, and nutrient cycling) across 482 U.S. basins. Our investigation uncovers systematic patterns of model performance disparities linked to basin characteristics, the inherent complexity of biogeochemical processes, and variable predictability, emphasizing critical performance fairness concerns. We further propose methodological frameworks for quantitatively evaluating critical aspects of trustworthiness, including uncertainty, interpretability, and robustness, identifying key limitations that could challenge reliable real-world deployment. This work serves as a timely call to action for advancing trustworthy data-driven methods for water resources management and provides a pathway to offering critical insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners seeking to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly in environmental management.

Abstract: Scaling laws are a critical component of the LLM development pipeline, most famously as a way to forecast training decisions such as 'compute-optimally' trading-off parameter count and dataset size, alongside a more recent growing list of other crucial decisions. In this work, we ask whether compute-optimal scaling behaviour can be skill-dependent. In particular, we examine knowledge and reasoning-based skills such as knowledge-based QA and code generation, and we answer this question in the affirmative: scaling laws are skill-dependent. Next, to understand whether skill-dependent scaling is an artefact of the pretraining datamix, we conduct an extensive ablation of different datamixes and find that, also when correcting for datamix differences, knowledge and code exhibit fundamental differences in scaling behaviour. We conclude with an analysis of how our findings relate to standard compute-optimal scaling using a validation set, and find that a misspecified validation set can impact compute-optimal parameter count by nearly 50%, depending on its skill composition.

Abstract: Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long been considered essential. This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique. We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation $DyT($x$) = \tanh(\alpha $x$)$, as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, $S$-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks.

<title>Collaborative Value Function Estimation Under Model Mismatch: A Federated Temporal Difference Analysis</title>

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) enables collaborative learning while preserving data privacy by preventing direct data exchange between agents. However, many existing FedRL algorithms assume that all agents operate in identical environments, which is often unrealistic. In real-world applications, such as multi-robot teams, crowdsourced systems, and large-scale sensor networks, each agent may experience slightly different transition dynamics, leading to inherent model mismatches. In this paper, we first establish linear convergence guarantees for single-agent temporal difference learning (TD(0)) in policy evaluation and demonstrate that under a perturbed environment, the agent suffers a systematic bias that prevents accurate estimation of the true value function. This result holds under both i.i.d. and Markovian sampling regimes. We then extend our analysis to the federated TD(0) (FedTD(0)) setting, where multiple agents, each interacting with its own perturbed environment, periodically share value estimates to collaboratively approximate the true value function of a common underlying model. Our theoretical results indicate the impact of model mismatch, network connectivity, and mixing behavior on the convergence of FedTD(0). Empirical experiments corroborate our theoretical gains, highlighting that even moderate levels of information sharing significantly mitigate environment-specific errors.

Abstract: In safety-critical applications, guaranteeing the satisfaction of constraints over continuous environments is crucial, e.g., an autonomous agent should never crash into obstacles or go off-road. Neural models struggle in the presence of these constraints, especially when they involve intricate algebraic relationships. To address this, we introduce a differentiable probabilistic layer that guarantees the satisfaction of non-convex algebraic constraints over continuous variables. This probabilistic algebraic layer (PAL) can be seamlessly plugged into any neural architecture and trained via maximum likelihood without requiring approximations. PAL defines a distribution over conjunctions and disjunctions of linear inequalities, parameterized by polynomials. This formulation enables efficient and exact renormalization via symbolic integration, which can be amortized across different data points and easily parallelized on a GPU. We showcase PAL and our integration scheme on a number of benchmarks for algebraic constraint integration and on real-world trajectory data.

Abstract: Numerous applications of large language models (LLMs) rely on their ability to perform step-by-step reasoning. However, the reasoning behavior of LLMs remains poorly understood, posing challenges to research, development, and safety. To address this gap, we introduce landscape of thoughts-the first visualization tool for users to inspect the reasoning paths of chain-of-thought and its derivatives on any multi-choice dataset. Specifically, we represent the states in a reasoning path as feature vectors that quantify their distances to all answer choices. These features are then visualized in two-dimensional plots using t-SNE. Qualitative and quantitative analysis with the landscape of thoughts effectively distinguishes between strong and weak models, correct and incorrect answers, as well as different reasoning tasks. It also uncovers undesirable reasoning patterns, such as low consistency and high uncertainty. Additionally, users can adapt our tool to a model that predicts the property they observe. We showcase this advantage by adapting our tool to a lightweight verifier that evaluates the correctness of reasoning paths. Empirically, this verifier boosts the accuracy of reasoning as well as the test-time scaling effect. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/landscape-of-thoughts.

Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page: https://kumarmanas.github.io/SHIFT/.

Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

<title>Ising Models with Hidden Markov Structure: Applications to Probabilistic Inference in Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate tree-indexed Markov chains (Gibbs measures) defined by a Hamiltonian that couples two Ising layers: hidden spins \(s(x) \in \{\pm 1\}\) and observed spins \(\sigma(x) \in \{\pm 1\}\) on a Cayley tree. The Hamiltonian incorporates Ising interactions within each layer and site-wise emission couplings between layers, extending hidden Markov models to a bilayer Markov random field.
  Specifically, we explore translation-invariant Gibbs measures (TIGM) of this Hamiltonian on Cayley trees.
  Under certain explicit conditions on the model's parameters, we demonstrate that there can be up to three distinct TIGMs. Each of these measures represents an equilibrium state of the spin system. These measures provide a structured approach to inference on hierarchical data in machine learning. They have practical applications in tasks such as denoising, weakly supervised learning, and anomaly detection. The Cayley tree structure is particularly advantageous for exact inference due to its tractability.

Abstract: Active automata learning infers automaton models of systems from behavioral observations, a technique successfully applied to a wide range of domains. Compositional approaches for concurrent systems have recently emerged. We take a significant step beyond available results, including those by the authors, and develop a general technique for compositional learning of a synchronizing parallel system with an unknown decomposition. Our approach automatically refines the global alphabet into component alphabets while learning the component models. We develop a theoretical treatment of distributions of alphabets, i.e., sets of possibly overlapping component alphabets. We characterize counter-examples that reveal inconsistencies with global observations, and show how to systematically update the distribution to restore consistency. We present a compositional learning algorithm implementing these ideas, where learning counterexamples precisely correspond to distribution counterexamples under well-defined conditions. We provide an implementation, called CoalA, using the state-of-the-art active learning library LearnLib. Our experiments show that in more than 630 subject systems, CoalA delivers orders of magnitude improvements (up to five orders) in membership queries and in systems with significant concurrency, it also achieves better scalability in the number of equivalence queries.

Abstract: The autoregressive nature of large language models (LLMs) limits inference speed. Each forward pass generates only a single token and is often bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. Speculative decoding alleviates this issue using a draft-then-verify approach to accelerate token generation. However, the overhead introduced during the draft phase and the training cost of the draft model limit the efficiency and adaptability of speculative decoding. In this work, we introduce PARallel Draft (PARD), a novel speculative decoding method that enables low-cost adaptation of autoregressive draft models into parallel draft models. PARD enhances inference efficiency by predicting multiple future tokens in a single forward pass of the draft phase, and incorporates a conditional drop token method to accelerate training. Its target-independence property allows a single draft model to be applied to an entire family of different models, minimizing the adaptation cost. Our proposed conditional drop token method can improves draft model training efficiency by 3x. On our optimized inference framework, PARD accelerates LLaMA3.1-8B inference by 4.08x, achieving 311.5 tokens per second.

Abstract: We introduce AegisLLM, a cooperative multi-agent defense against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization. We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility. This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM. On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls. For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods. Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used method for compressing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), where less relevant parameters are removed from a DNN model to reduce its size. However, removing parameters reduces model accuracy, so pruning is typically combined with fine-tuning, and sometimes other operations such as rewinding weights, to recover accuracy. A common approach is to repeatedly prune and then fine-tune, with increasing amounts of model parameters being removed in each step. While straightforward to implement, pruning pipelines that follow this approach are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated fine-tuning.
  In this paper we propose ICE-Pruning, an iterative pruning pipeline for DNNs that significantly decreases the time required for pruning by reducing the overall cost of fine-tuning, while maintaining a similar accuracy to existing pruning pipelines. ICE-Pruning is based on three main components: i) an automatic mechanism to determine after which pruning steps fine-tuning should be performed; ii) a freezing strategy for faster fine-tuning in each pruning step; and iii) a custom pruning-aware learning rate scheduler to further improve the accuracy of each pruning step and reduce the overall time consumption. We also propose an efficient auto-tuning stage for the hyperparameters (e.g., freezing percentage) introduced by the three components. We evaluate ICE-Pruning on several DNN models and datasets, showing that it can accelerate pruning by up to 9.61x. Code is available at https://github.com/gicLAB/ICE-Pruning

Abstract: Model merging provides a scalable alternative to multi-task training by combining specialized finetuned models through parameter arithmetic, enabling efficient deployment without the need for joint training or access to all task data. While recent methods have shown promise, existing evaluations are limited in both model scale and task diversity, leaving open questions about their applicability to large, domain-specialized LLMs. To tackle the challenges, we introduce MergeBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess model merging at scale. MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding, coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance, forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training pipelines. We hope MergeBench provides a foundation for future research to advance the understanding and practical application of model merging.

Abstract: The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying densities and degree distributions.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a framework for predictive inference with a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee. However, it tends to provide uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPI), a novel framework that incorporates synthetic data -- e.g., from a generative model -- to improve sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score transporter into the calibration process, SPI provably achieves finite-sample coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPI yields substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification -- augmenting data with synthetic diffusion-model generated images -- and on tabular regression demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in data-scarce settings.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels, thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks (GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by 3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies, characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.

Abstract: Invertible neural architectures have recently attracted attention for their compactness, interpretability, and information-preserving properties. In this work, we propose the Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE), which combines invertible monotonic activation functions with reversible filter structures, and could be extended using Invertible ResNets. This architecture is examined in learning low-dimensional representations of one-dimensional nonlinear wave interactions and exact circular translation symmetry. Dimensionality is preserved across layers, except for a Fourier truncation step in the latent space, which enables dimensionality reduction while maintaining shift equivariance and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that FINE significantly outperforms classical linear methods such as Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and achieves reconstruction accuracy better than conventional deep autoencoders with convolutional layers (CNN) - while using substantially smaller models and offering superior physical interpretability. These findings suggest that invertible single-neuron networks, when combined with spectral truncation, offer a promising framework for learning compact and interpretable representations of physics datasets, and symmetry-aware representation learning in physics-informed machine learning.

Abstract: After a renaissance phase in which researchers revisited the message-passing paradigm through the lens of deep learning, the graph machine learning community shifted its attention towards a deeper and practical understanding of message-passing's benefits and limitations. In this position paper, we notice how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions that are not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution wants to make such common beliefs explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, supported by simple but noteworthy counterexamples. The hope is to clarify the distinction between the different issues and promote separate but intertwined research directions to address them.

Abstract: Foundation models hold significant promise in healthcare, given their capacity to extract meaningful representations independent of downstream tasks. This property has enabled state-of-the-art performance across several clinical applications trained on structured electronic health record (EHR) data, even in settings with limited labeled data, a prevalent challenge in healthcare. However, there is little consensus on these models' potential for clinical utility due to the lack of desiderata of comprehensive and meaningful tasks and sufficiently diverse evaluations to characterize the benefit over conventional supervised learning. To address this gap, we propose a suite of clinically meaningful tasks spanning patient outcomes, early prediction of acute and chronic conditions, including desiderata for robust evaluations. We evaluate state-of-the-art foundation models on EHR data consisting of 5 million patients from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC), a large urban academic medical center in New York City, across 14 clinically relevant tasks. We measure overall accuracy, calibration, and subpopulation performance to surface tradeoffs based on the choice of pre-training, tokenization, and data representation strategies. Our study aims to advance the empirical evaluation of structured EHR foundation models and guide the development of future healthcare foundation models.

<title>Automating Versatile Time-Series Analysis with Tiny Transformers on Embedded FPGAs</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).

<title>SOSBENCH: Benchmarking Safety Alignment on Scientific Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advancing capabilities in complex tasks, such as reasoning and graduate-level question answering, yet their resilience against misuse, particularly involving scientifically sophisticated risks, remains underexplored. Existing safety benchmarks typically focus either on instructions requiring minimal knowledge comprehension (e.g., ``tell me how to build a bomb") or utilize prompts that are relatively low-risk (e.g., multiple-choice or classification tasks about hazardous content). Consequently, they fail to adequately assess model safety when handling knowledge-intensive, hazardous scenarios.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce SOSBench, a regulation-grounded, hazard-focused benchmark encompassing six high-risk scientific domains: chemistry, biology, medicine, pharmacology, physics, and psychology. The benchmark comprises 3,000 prompts derived from real-world regulations and laws, systematically expanded via an LLM-assisted evolutionary pipeline that introduces diverse, realistic misuse scenarios (e.g., detailed explosive synthesis instructions involving advanced chemical formulas). We evaluate frontier models within a unified evaluation framework using our SOSBench. Despite their alignment claims, advanced models consistently disclose policy-violating content across all domains, demonstrating alarmingly high rates of harmful responses (e.g., 79.1% for Deepseek-R1 and 47.3% for GPT-4.1). These results highlight significant safety alignment deficiencies and underscore urgent concerns regarding the responsible deployment of powerful LLMs.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we propose \textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\&amp;M)}, a novel continual learning framework that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, after training on each task, P\&amp;M constructs a new model by forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, we minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive an analytical solution for the optimal merging coefficient. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\&amp;M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several continual learning benchmark datasets.

<title>Graph Positional Autoencoders as Self-supervised Learners</title>

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning seeks to learn effective graph representations without relying on labeled data. Among various approaches, graph autoencoders (GAEs) have gained significant attention for their efficiency and scalability. Typically, GAEs take incomplete graphs as input and predict missing elements, such as masked nodes or edges. While effective, our experimental investigation reveals that traditional node or edge masking paradigms primarily capture low-frequency signals in the graph and fail to learn the expressive structural information. To address these issues, we propose Graph Positional Autoencoders (GraphPAE), which employs a dual-path architecture to reconstruct both node features and positions. Specifically, the feature path uses positional encoding to enhance the message-passing processing, improving GAE's ability to predict the corrupted information. The position path, on the other hand, leverages node representations to refine positions and approximate eigenvectors, thereby enabling the encoder to learn diverse frequency information. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of GraphPAE, including heterophilic node classification, graph property prediction, and transfer learning. The results demonstrate that GraphPAE achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: Length of stay (LOS) prediction in acute stroke is critical for improving care planning. Existing machine learning models have shown suboptimal predictive performance, limited generalisability, and have overlooked system-level factors. We aimed to enhance model efficiency, performance, and interpretability by refining predictors and developing an interpretable multi-level stacking ensemble model. Data were accessed from the biennial Stroke Foundation Acute Audit (2015, 2017, 2019, 2021) in Australia. Models were developed for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke separately. The outcome was prolonged LOS (the LOS above the 75th percentile). Candidate predictors (ischaemic: n=89; haemorrhagic: n=83) were categorised into patient, clinical, and system domains. Feature selection with correlation-based approaches was used to refine key predictors. The evaluation of models included discrimination (AUC), calibration curves, and interpretability (SHAP plots). In ischaemic stroke (N=12,575), prolonged LOS was >=9 days, compared to >=11 days in haemorrhagic stroke (N=1,970). The ensemble model achieved superior performance [AUC: 0.824 (95% CI: 0.801-0.846)] and statistically outperformed logistic regression [AUC: 0.805 (95% CI: 0.782-0.829); P=0.0004] for ischaemic. However, the model [AUC: 0.843 (95% CI: 0.790-0.895)] did not statistically outperform logistic regression [AUC: 0.828 (95% CI: 0.774-0.882); P=0.136] for haemorrhagic. SHAP analysis identified shared predictors for both types of stroke: rehabilitation assessment, urinary incontinence, stroke unit care, inability to walk independently, physiotherapy, and stroke care coordinators involvement. An explainable ensemble model effectively predicted the prolonged LOS in ischaemic stroke. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed for haemorrhagic stroke.

Abstract: An important characteristic of temporal graphs is how the directed arrow of time influences their causal topology, i.e., which nodes can possibly influence each other causally via time-respecting paths. The resulting patterns are often neglected by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). To formally analyze the expressive power of TGNNs, we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology. Addressing this gap, we introduce the notion of consistent event graph isomorphism, which utilizes a time-unfolded representation of time-respecting paths in temporal graphs. We compare this definition with existing notions of temporal graph isomorphisms. We illustrate and highlight the advantages of our approach and develop a temporal generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm to heuristically distinguish non-isomorphic temporal graphs. Building on this theoretical foundation, we derive a novel message passing scheme for temporal graph neural networks that operates on the event graph representation of temporal graphs. An experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs well in a temporal graph classification experiment.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for degradation systems is crucial in modern prognostic and health management (PHM). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.

Abstract: Sparse tensor programs are essential in deep learning and graph analytics, driving the need for optimized processing. To meet this demand, specialized hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end, we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and 1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.

Abstract: Episodic memory enables humans to recall past experiences by associating semantic elements such as objects, locations, and time into coherent event representations. While large pretrained models have shown remarkable progress in modeling semantic memory, the mechanisms for forming associative structures that support episodic memory remain underexplored. Inspired by hippocampal CA3 dynamics and its role in associative memory, we propose the Latent Structured Hopfield Network (LSHN), a biologically inspired framework that integrates continuous Hopfield attractor dynamics into an autoencoder architecture. LSHN mimics the cortical-hippocampal pathway: a semantic encoder extracts compact latent representations, a latent Hopfield network performs associative refinement through attractor convergence, and a decoder reconstructs perceptual input. Unlike traditional Hopfield networks, our model is trained end-to-end with gradient descent, achieving scalable and robust memory retrieval. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a simulated episodic memory task demonstrate superior performance in recalling corrupted inputs under occlusion and noise, outperforming existing associative memory models. Our work provides a computational perspective on how semantic elements can be dynamically bound into episodic memory traces through biologically grounded attractor mechanisms.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.

Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep, is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and overtaking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while preserving desirable travel efficiency.

Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for real-world conditions.

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model.

Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system constraints.

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically, POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in training LLMs.

Abstract: We extend conformal prediction to control the expected value of any monotone loss function. The algorithm generalizes split conformal prediction together with its coverage guarantee. Like conformal prediction, the conformal risk control procedure is tight up to an $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ factor. We also introduce extensions of the idea to distribution shift, quantile risk control, multiple and adversarial risk control, and expectations of U-statistics. Worked examples from computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate the usage of our algorithm to bound the false negative rate, graph distance, and token-level F1-score.

Abstract: Transformer-based self-supervised models have achieved remarkable success in speech processing, but their large size and high inference cost present significant challenges for real-world deployment. While numerous compression techniques have been proposed, inconsistent evaluation metrics make it difficult to compare their practical effectiveness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of four common compression methods, including weight pruning, head pruning, low-rank approximation, and knowledge distillation on self-supervised speech Transformers. We evaluate each method under three key metrics: parameter count, multiply-accumulate operations, and real-time factor. Results show that each method offers distinct advantages. In addition, we contextualize recent compression techniques, comparing DistilHuBERT, FitHuBERT, LightHuBERT, ARMHuBERT, and STaRHuBERT under the same framework, offering practical guidance on compression for deployment.

Abstract: Biometric recognition as an efficient and hard-to-forge way of identification and verification has become an indispensable part of the current digital world. The fast evolution of this technology has been a strong incentive for integration into many applications. Meanwhile, blockchain, the decentralized ledger technology, has been widely received by both research and industry in the past few years, and it is being increasingly deployed today in many different applications, such as money transfer, IoT, healthcare, or logistics. Recently, researchers have started to speculate on the pros and cons and what the best applications would be when these two technologies cross paths. This paper provides a survey of the research literature on the combination of blockchain and biometrics and includes a first legal analysis of this integration based on GDPR to shed light on challenges and potentials. Although the integration of blockchain technology into the biometric sector is still in its infancy, with a growing body of literature discussing specific applications and advanced technological setups, this paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of blockchain applicability in biometrics. Based on published studies, this article discusses, among others, practical examples combining blockchain and biometrics for novel applications in PKI systems, distributed trusted services, and identity management. Challenges and limitations when combining blockchain and biometrics that motivate future work will also be discussed; e.g., blockchain networks at their current stage may not be efficient or economical for some real-time biometric applications. Finally, we also discuss key legal aspects of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) related to this combination of technologies (blockchain and biometrics); for example, accountability, immutability, anonymity, and data protection elements.

Abstract: The computation of equilibrium prices at which the supply of goods matches their demand typically relies on complete information on agents' private attributes, e.g., suppliers' cost functions, which are often unavailable in practice. Motivated by this practical consideration, we consider the problem of learning equilibrium prices over a horizon of $T$ periods in the incomplete information setting wherein a market operator seeks to satisfy the customer demand for a commodity by purchasing it from competing suppliers with cost functions unknown to the operator. We first consider the setting when suppliers' cost functions are fixed and develop algorithms that, on three pertinent regret metrics, simultaneously achieve a regret of $O(1)$ when the customer demand is constant over time, and $O(\sqrt{T})$ when the demand varies over time. In the setting when the suppliers' cost functions vary over time, we demonstrate that, in general, no online algorithm can achieve sublinear regret on all three metrics. Thus, we consider an augmented setting wherein the operator has access to hints/contexts that reflect the variation in the cost functions and propose an algorithm with sublinear regret in this augmented setting. Finally, we present numerical experiments that validate our results and discuss various model extensions.

Abstract: Early detection of Barrett's Esophagus (BE), the only known precursor to Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), is crucial for effectively preventing and treating esophageal cancer. In this work, we investigate the potential of geometric Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn a meaningful latent representation that captures the progression of BE. We show that hyperspherical VAE (S-VAE) and Kendall Shape VAE show improved classification accuracy, reconstruction loss, and generative capacity. Additionally, we present a novel autoencoder architecture that can generate qualitative images without the need for a variational framework while retaining the benefits of an autoencoder, such as improved stability and reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Network pruning is a commonly used measure to alleviate the storage and computational burden of deep neural networks. However, the fundamental limit of network pruning is still lacking. To close the gap, in this work we'll take a first-principles approach, i.e. we'll directly impose the sparsity constraint on the loss function and leverage the framework of statistical dimension in convex geometry, thus enabling us to characterize the sharp phase transition point, which can be regarded as the fundamental limit of the pruning ratio. Through this limit, we're able to identify two key factors that determine the pruning ratio limit, namely, weight magnitude and network sharpness. Generally speaking, the flatter the loss landscape or the smaller the weight magnitude, the smaller pruning ratio. Moreover, we provide efficient countermeasures to address the challenges in the computation of the pruning limit, which mainly involves the accurate spectrum estimation of a large-scale and non-positive Hessian matrix. Moreover, through the lens of the pruning ratio threshold, we can also provide rigorous interpretations on several heuristics in existing pruning algorithms. Extensive experiments are performed which demonstrate that our theoretical pruning ratio threshold coincides very well with the experiments.

<title>Efficient Numerical Integration in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces via Leverage Scores Sampling</title>

Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of numerical integration, i.e., approximating integrals with respect to a target probability measure using only pointwise evaluations of the integrand. We focus on the setting in which the target distribution is only accessible through a set of $n$ i.i.d. observations, and the integrand belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose an efficient procedure which exploits a small i.i.d. random subset of $m<n$ samples drawn either uniformly or using approximate leverage scores from the initial observations. Our main result is an upper bound on the approximation error of this procedure for both sampling strategies. It yields sufficient conditions on the subsample size to recover the standard (optimal) $n^{-1/2}$ rate while reducing drastically the number of functions evaluations, and thus the overall computational cost. Moreover, we obtain rates with respect to the number $m$ of evaluations of the integrand which adapt to its smoothness, and match known optimal rates for instance for Sobolev spaces. We illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on real datasets, which highlight the attractive efficiency-accuracy tradeoff of our method compared to existing randomized and greedy quadrature methods. We note that, the problem of numerical integration in RKHS amounts to designing a discrete approximation of the kernel mean embedding of the target distribution. As a consequence, direct applications of our results also include the efficient computation of maximum mean discrepancies between distributions and the design of efficient kernel-based tests.

Abstract: Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.

Abstract: In this paper, we study zeroth-order algorithms for nonconvex minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under the deterministic and stochastic settings, which have attracted wide attention in machine learning, signal processing and many other fields in recent years, e.g., adversarial attacks in resource allocation problems and network flow problems etc. We propose two single-loop algorithms, namely the zeroth-order primal-dual alternating projected gradient (ZO-PDAPG) algorithm and the zeroth-order regularized momentum primal-dual projected gradient algorithm (ZO-RMPDPG), for solving deterministic and stochastic nonconvex-(strongly) concave minimax problems with coupled linear constraints. The iteration complexity of the two proposed algorithms to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point are proved to be $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon ^{-2})$ (resp. $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon ^{-4})$) for solving nonconvex-strongly concave (resp. nonconvex-concave) minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under deterministic settings and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon ^{-3})$ (resp. $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon ^{-6.5})$) under stochastic settings respectively. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first two zeroth-order algorithms with iterative complexity guarantees for solving nonconvex-(strongly) concave minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under the deterministic and stochastic settings.

Abstract: Algorithms are increasingly used to aid with high-stakes decision making. Yet, their predictive ability frequently exhibits systematic variation across population subgroups. To assess the trade-off between fairness and accuracy using finite data, we propose a debiased machine learning estimator for the fairness-accuracy frontier introduced by Liang, Lu, Mu, and Okumura (2024). We derive its asymptotic distribution and propose inference methods to test key hypotheses in the fairness literature, such as (i) whether excluding group identity from use in training the algorithm is optimal and (ii) whether there are less discriminatory alternatives to a given algorithm. In addition, we construct an estimator for the distance between a given algorithm and the fairest point on the frontier, and characterize its asymptotic distribution. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of our inference methods. We apply our framework to re-evaluate algorithms used in hospital care management and show that our approach yields alternative algorithms that lie on the fairness-accuracy frontier, offering improvements along both dimensions.

Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of QHT, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on QHT, we characterize the sample complexity of binary QHT in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse type II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy, provided that the type II error probability is sufficiently small. We then provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds. The final part of our paper outlines and reviews how sample complexity of QHT is relevant to a broad swathe of research areas and can enhance understanding of many fundamental concepts, including quantum algorithms for simulation and search, quantum learning and classification, and foundations of quantum mechanics. As such, we view our paper as an invitation to researchers coming from different communities to study and contribute to the problem of sample complexity of QHT, and we outline a number of open directions for future research.

Abstract: Histopathological staining of human tissue is essential for disease diagnosis. Recent advances in virtual tissue staining technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) alleviate some of the costly and tedious steps involved in traditional histochemical staining processes, permitting multiplexed staining and tissue preservation. However, potential hallucinations and artifacts in these virtually stained tissue images pose concerns, especially for the clinical uses of these approaches. Quality assessment of histology images by experts can be subjective. Here, we present an autonomous quality and hallucination assessment method, AQuA, for virtual tissue staining and digital pathology. AQuA autonomously achieves 99.8% accuracy when detecting acceptable and unacceptable virtually stained tissue images without access to histochemically stained ground truth, and presents an agreement of 98.5% with the manual assessments made by board-certified pathologists, including identifying realistic-looking images that could mislead diagnosticians. We demonstrate the wide adaptability of AQuA across various virtually and histochemically stained human tissue images. This framework enhances the reliability of virtual tissue staining and provides autonomous quality assurance for image generation and transformation tasks in digital pathology and computational imaging.

Abstract: With the next generation of interferometric telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the need for highly computationally efficient reconstruction techniques is particularly acute. The challenge in designing learned, data-driven reconstruction techniques for radio interferometry is that they need to be agnostic to the varying visibility coverages of the telescope, since these are different for each observation. Because of this, learned post-processing or learned unrolled iterative reconstruction methods must typically be retrained for each specific observation, amounting to a large computational overhead. In this work we develop learned post-processing and unrolled iterative methods for varying visibility coverages, proposing training strategies to make these methods agnostic to variations in visibility coverage with minimal to no fine-tuning. Learned post-processing techniques are heavily dependent on the prior information encoded in training data and generalise poorly to other visibility coverages. In contrast, unrolled iterative methods, which include the telescope measurement operator inside the network, achieve good reconstruction quality and computation time, generalising well to other coverages and require little to no fine-tuning. Furthermore, they generalise well to more realistic radio observations and are able to reconstruct images with with a larger dynamic range than the training set.

Abstract: Neural networks with ReLU activation play a key role in modern machine learning. Understanding the functions represented by ReLU networks is a major topic in current research as this enables a better interpretability of learning processes. Injectivity of a function computed by a ReLU network, that is, the question if different inputs to the network always lead to different outputs, plays a crucial role whenever invertibility of the function is required, such as, e.g., for inverse problems or generative models. The exact computational complexity of deciding injectivity was recently posed as an open problem (Puthawala et al. [JMLR 2022]). We answer this question by proving coNP-completeness. On the positive side, we show that the problem for a single ReLU-layer is still tractable for small input dimension; more precisely, we present a parameterized algorithm which yields fixed-parameter tractability with respect to the input dimension. In addition, we study the network verification problem which is to verify that certain inputs only yield specific outputs. This is of great importance since neural networks are increasingly used in safety-critical systems. We prove that network verification is coNP-hard for a general class of input domains. Our results also exclude constant-factor polynomial-time approximations for the maximum of a function computed by a ReLU network. In this context, we also characterize surjectivity of functions computed by ReLU networks with one-dimensional output which turns out to be the complement of a basic network verification task. We reveal interesting connections to computational convexity by formulating the surjectivity problem as a zonotope containment problem

Abstract: Deep linear networks have been extensively studied, as they provide simplified models of deep learning. However, little is known in the case of finite-width architectures with multiple outputs and convolutional layers. In this manuscript, we provide rigorous results for the statistics of functions implemented by the aforementioned class of networks, thus moving closer to a complete characterization of feature learning in the Bayesian setting. Our results include: (i) an exact and elementary non-asymptotic integral representation for the joint prior distribution over the outputs, given in terms of a mixture of Gaussians; (ii) an analytical formula for the posterior distribution in the case of squared error loss function (Gaussian likelihood); (iii) a quantitative description of the feature learning infinite-width regime, using large deviation theory. From a physical perspective, deep architectures with multiple outputs or convolutional layers represent different manifestations of kernel shape renormalization, and our work provides a dictionary that translates this physics intuition and terminology into rigorous Bayesian statistics.

Abstract: Operational disruptions can significantly impact companies performance. Ford, with its 37 plants globally, uses 17 billion parts annually to manufacture six million cars and trucks. With up to ten tiers of suppliers between the company and raw materials, any extended disruption in this supply chain can cause substantial financial losses. Therefore, the ability to forecast and identify such disruptions early is crucial for maintaining seamless operations. In this study, we demonstrate how we construct a dataset consisting of many multivariate time series to forecast first-tier supply chain disruptions, utilizing features related to capacity, inventory, utilization, and processing, as outlined in the classical Factory Physics framework. This dataset is technically challenging due to its vast scale of over five hundred thousand time series. Furthermore, these time series, while exhibiting certain similarities, also display heterogeneity within specific subgroups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates an enhanced Attention Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning architecture, using Neural Network Embeddings to model group effects, with a Survival Analysis model. This model is designed to learn intricate heterogeneous data patterns related to operational disruptions. Our model has demonstrated a strong performance, achieving 0.85 precision and 0.8 recall during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase across Ford's five North American plants. Additionally, to address the common criticism of Machine Learning models as black boxes, we show how the SHAP framework can be used to generate feature importance from the model predictions. It offers valuable insights that can lead to actionable strategies and highlights the potential of advanced machine learning for managing and mitigating supply chain risks in the automotive industry.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly widespread among software developers. However, privacy and computational requirements are problematic with commercial solutions and the use of LLMs. In this work, we focus on using relatively small and efficient LLMs with 160M parameters that are suitable for local execution and augmentation with retrieval from local projects. We train two open transformer-based models, the generative GPT-2 and the retrieval-adapted RETRO, on open-source Python files, and empirically compare them, confirming the benefits of embedding-based retrieval. Furthermore, we improve our models' performance with In-context retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which retrieves code snippets using the Jaccard similarity of tokens. We evaluate In-context RAG on larger models and determine that, despite its simplicity, the approach is more suitable than using the RETRO architecture. Experimental results indicate that In-context RAG improves the code completion baseline by over 26%, while RETRO improves over the similarly sized GPT-2 baseline by 12%. We highlight the key role of proper tokenization in achieving the full potential of LLMs in code completion.

Abstract: Is there a way to design powerful AI systems based on machine learning methods that would satisfy probabilistic safety guarantees? With the long-term goal of obtaining a probabilistic guarantee that would apply in every context, we consider estimating a context-dependent bound on the probability of violating a given safety specification. Such a risk evaluation would need to be performed at run-time to provide a guardrail against dangerous actions of an AI. Noting that different plausible hypotheses about the world could produce very different outcomes, and because we do not know which one is right, we derive bounds on the safety violation probability predicted under the true but unknown hypothesis. Such bounds could be used to reject potentially dangerous actions. Our main results involve searching for cautious but plausible hypotheses, obtained by a maximization that involves Bayesian posteriors over hypotheses. We consider two forms of this result, in the i.i.d. case and in the non-i.i.d. case, and conclude with open problems towards turning such theoretical results into practical AI guardrails.

<title>AUnified Framework for Next-Gen Urban Forecasting via LLM-driven Dependency Retrieval and GeoTransformer</title>

Abstract: Urban forecasting has increasingly benefited from high-dimensional spatial data through two primary approaches: graph-based methods that rely on predefined spatial structures, and region-based methods that focus on learning expressive urban representations. Although these methods have laid a strong foundation, they either rely heavily on structured spatial data, struggle to adapt to task-specific dependencies, or fail to integrate holistic urban context. Moreover, no existing framework systematically integrates these two paradigms and overcomes their respective limitations. To address this gap, we propose a novel, unified framework for high-dimensional urban forecasting, composed of three key components: (1) the Urban Region Representation Module that organizes latent embeddings and semantic descriptions for each region, (2) the Task-aware Dependency Retrieval module that selects relevant context regions based on natural language prompts, and (3) the Prediction Module, exemplified by our proposed GeoTransformer architecture, which adopts a novel geospatial attention mechanism to incorporate spatial proximity and information entropy as priors. Our framework is modular, supports diverse representation methods and forecasting models, and can operate even with minimal input. Quantitative experiments and qualitative analysis across six urban forecasting tasks demonstrate strong task generalization and validate the framework's effectiveness.

<title>Toward End-to-End Bearing Fault Diagnosis for Industrial Scenarios with Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the application of spiking neural networks (SNNs), known for their low-power binary spikes, to bearing fault diagnosis, bridging the gap between high-performance AI algorithms and real-world industrial scenarios. In particular, we identify two key limitations of existing SNN fault diagnosis methods: inadequate encoding capacity that necessitates cumbersome data preprocessing, and non-spike-oriented architectures that constrain the performance of SNNs. To alleviate these problems, we propose a Multi-scale Residual Attention SNN (MRA-SNN) to simultaneously improve the efficiency, performance, and robustness of SNN methods. By incorporating a lightweight attention mechanism, we have designed a multi-scale attention encoding module to extract multiscale fault features from vibration signals and encode them as spatio-temporal spikes, eliminating the need for complicated preprocessing. Then, the spike residual attention block extracts high-dimensional fault features and enhances the expressiveness of sparse spikes with the attention mechanism for end-to-end diagnosis. In addition, the performance and robustness of MRA-SNN is further enhanced by introducing the lightweight attention mechanism within the spiking neurons to simulate the biological dendritic filtering effect. Extensive experiments on MFPT, JNU, Bearing, and Gearbox benchmark datasets demonstrate that MRA-SNN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, energy consumption, and noise robustness, and is more feasible for deployment in real-world industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Multilevel models (MLMs) are a central building block of the Bayesian workflow. They enable joint, interpretable modeling of data across hierarchical levels and provide a fully probabilistic quantification of uncertainty. Despite their well-recognized advantages, MLMs pose significant computational challenges, often rendering their estimation and evaluation intractable within reasonable time constraints. Recent advances in simulation-based inference offer promising solutions for addressing complex probabilistic models using deep generative networks. However, the utility and reliability of deep learning methods for estimating Bayesian MLMs remains largely unexplored, especially when compared with gold-standard samplers. To this end, we explore a family of neural network architectures that leverage the probabilistic factorization of multilevel models to facilitate efficient neural network training and subsequent near-instant posterior inference on unseen datasets. We test our method on several real-world case studies and provide comprehensive comparisons to Stan's gold standard sampler, where possible. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of our methods to stimulate further research in the nascent field of amortized Bayesian inference.

Abstract: Framing the investigation of diverse cancers as a machine learning problem has recently shown significant potential in multi-omics analysis and cancer research. Empowering these successful machine learning models are the high-quality training datasets with sufficient data volume and adequate preprocessing. However, while there exist several public data portals, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics initiative or open-bases such as the LinkedOmics, these databases are not off-the-shelf for existing machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce MLOmics, an open cancer multi-omics database aiming at serving better the development and evaluation of bioinformatics and machine learning models. MLOmics contains 8,314 patient samples covering all 32 cancer types with four omics types, stratified features, and extensive baselines. Complementary support for downstream analysis and bio-knowledge linking are also included to support interdisciplinary analysis.

Abstract: Non-stationary multi-armed bandits (NS-MABs) model sequential decision-making problems in which the expected rewards of a set of actions, a.k.a.~arms, evolve over time. In this paper, we fill a gap in the literature by providing a novel analysis of Thompson sampling-inspired (TS) algorithms for NS-MABs that both corrects and generalizes existing work. Specifically, we study the cumulative frequentist regret of two algorithms based on sliding-window TS approaches with different priors, namely $\textit{Beta-SWTS}$ and $\textit{$\gamma$-SWGTS}$. We derive a unifying regret upper bound for these algorithms that applies to any arbitrary NS-MAB (with either Bernoulli or subgaussian rewards). Our result introduces new indices that capture the inherent sources of complexity in the learning problem. Then, we specialize our general result to two of the most common NS-MAB settings: the $\textit{abruptly changing}$ and the $\textit{smoothly changing}$ environments, showing that it matches state-of-the-art results. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the analyzed algorithms in simulated environments and compare them with state-of-the-art approaches for NS-MABs.

<title>Scaling Laws For Mixed Qquantization</title>

Abstract: Post-training quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective in reducing the memory and computational requirements for inference. In this study, we focus on a straightforward question: When aiming for a target accuracy or perplexity with low-precision quantization, how much high-precision computation needs to be preserved and how fine-grained this quantization would need to be as we scale LLMs to larger sizes? We first introduce two critical metrics named the quantization ratio ($Q_r$) and quantization block size ($Q_b$). The former measures the number of parameters quantized to low-precision arithmetic normalized by the total parameter count, whereas the latter defines the number of values within a block that share a scaling factor, akin to the block size concept introduced in the FP4 format in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. Through extensive and carefully controlled experiments across different model and quantization methods, we propose a unified scaling law on post-training quantization (PTQ) that can predict loss degeneration for varying $Q_r$ and $Q_b$. For $Q_r$, our scaling law implies that parameter scaling and ratio scaling have a multiplicative relationship. Consequently, larger models are more amenable to a higher quantization ratio $Q_r$, thus supporting an increase in the adoption of mixed quantization for inference. Regarding $Q_b$, our findings indicate that a small block size, similar to that used in Blackwell, is not essential for large models. Employing a small $Q_b$ can instead unnecessarily complicate the design of the hardware circuit.

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense language models into sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models is an efficient approach to increase the model capacity of already trained models. However, optimal techniques for upcycling at scale remain unclear. In this work, we conduct an extensive study of upcycling methods and hyperparameters for billion-parameter scale language models. We propose a novel "virtual group" initialization scheme and weight scaling approach to enable upcycling into fine-grained MoE architectures. Through ablations, we find that upcycling outperforms continued dense model training. In addition, we show that softmax-then-topK expert routing improves over topK-then-softmax approach and higher granularity MoEs can help improve accuracy. Finally, we upcycled Nemotron-4 15B on 1T tokens and compared it to a continuously trained version of the same model on the same 1T tokens: the continuous trained model achieved 65.3% MMLU, whereas the upcycled model achieved 67.6%. Our results offer insights and best practices to effectively leverage upcycling for building MoE language models. Code is available.

Abstract: Deep learning and advancements in contactless sensors have significantly enhanced our ability to understand complex human activities in healthcare settings. In particular, deep learning models utilizing computer vision have been developed to enable detailed analysis of human gesture recognition, especially repetitive gestures which are commonly observed behaviors in children with autism. This research work aims to identify repetitive behaviors indicative of autism by analyzing videos captured in natural settings as children engage in daily activities. The focus is on accurately categorizing real-time repetitive gestures such as spinning, head banging, and arm flapping. To this end, we utilize the publicly accessible Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD) to classify these stereotypical movements. A key component of the proposed methodology is the use of \textbf{VideoMAE}, a model designed to improve both spatial and temporal analysis of video data through a masking and reconstruction mechanism. This model significantly outperformed traditional methods, achieving an accuracy of 97.7\%, a 14.7\% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.

<title>FlatQuant: Flatness Matters for LLM Quantization</title>

Abstract: Recently, quantization has been widely used for the compression and acceleration of large language models (LLMs). Due to the outliers in LLMs, it is crucial to flatten weights and activations to minimize quantization error with equally spaced quantization points. Prior research explores various pre-quantization transformations to suppress outliers, such as per-channel scaling and Hadamard transformation. However, we observe that these transformed weights and activations can still exhibit steep and dispersed distributions. In this paper, we propose FlatQuant (Fast and Learnable Affine Transformation), a new post-training quantization approach that enhances the flatness of weights and activations. Our approach identifies optimal affine transformations for each linear layer, calibrated in hours via a lightweight objective. To reduce runtime overhead of affine transformation, we apply Kronecker product with two lightweight matrices, and fuse all operations in FlatQuant into a single kernel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlatQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for quantization. For example, it achieves less than 1\% accuracy drop for W4A4 quantization on the LLaMA-3-70B model, surpassing SpinQuant by 7.5\%. Additionally, it provides up to 2.3x prefill speedup and 1.7x decoding speedup compared to the FP16 model. Code is available at: https://github.com/ruikangliu/FlatQuant.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for obtaining high-performance policies. However, the safety of these policies has been a long-standing issue. One promising paradigm to guarantee safety is a shield, which shields a policy from making unsafe actions. However, computing a shield scales exponentially in the number of state variables. This is a particular concern in multi-agent systems with many agents. In this work, we propose a novel approach for multi-agent shielding. We address scalability by computing individual shields for each agent. The challenge is that typical safety specifications are global properties, but the shields of individual agents only ensure local properties. Our key to overcome this challenge is to apply assume-guarantee reasoning. Specifically, we present a sound proof rule that decomposes a (global, complex) safety specification into (local, simple) obligations for the shields of the individual agents. Moreover, we show that applying the shields during reinforcement learning significantly improves the quality of the policies obtained for a given training budget. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our multi-agent shielding framework in two case studies, reducing the computation time from hours to seconds and achieving fast learning convergence.

<title>MoH: Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention</title>

arXiv:2410.11842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we upgrade the multi-head attention mechanism, the core of the Transformer model, to improve efficiency while maintaining or surpassing the previous accuracy level. We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in the summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold equal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new architecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second, MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking extra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs demonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head attention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH models. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the attention heads. We believe the proposed MoH is a promising alternative to multi-head attention and provides a strong foundation for developing advanced and efficient attention-based models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress on image-to-video (I2V) generation, while their noise-to-data generation process is inherently mismatched with this task, which may lead to suboptimal synthesis quality. In this work, we present FrameBridge. By modeling the frame-to-frames generation process with a bridge model based data-to-data generative process, we are able to fully exploit the information contained in the given image and improve the consistency between the generation process and I2V task. Moreover, we propose two novel techniques toward the two popular settings of training I2V models, respectively. Firstly, we propose SNR-Aligned Fine-tuning (SAF), making the first attempt to fine-tune a diffusion model to a bridge model and, therefore, allowing us to utilize the pre-trained diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models. Secondly, we propose neural prior, further improving the synthesis quality of FrameBridge when training from scratch. Experiments conducted on WebVid-2M and UCF-101 demonstrate the superior quality of FrameBridge in comparison with the diffusion counterpart (zero-shot FVD 95 vs. 192 on MSR-VTT and non-zero-shot FVD 122 vs. 171 on UCF-101), and the advantages of our proposed SAF and neural prior for bridge-based I2V models.

arXiv:2411.03932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we close the fundamental gap of theory and practice by providing an improved regret bound for linear ensemble sampling. We prove that with an ensemble size logarithmic in $T$, linear ensemble sampling can achieve a frequentist regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, matching state-of-the-art results for randomized linear bandit algorithms, where $d$ and $T$ are the dimension of the parameter and the time horizon respectively. Our approach introduces a general regret analysis framework for linear bandit algorithms. Additionally, we reveal a significant relationship between linear ensemble sampling and Linear Perturbed-History Exploration (LinPHE), showing that LinPHE is a special case of linear ensemble sampling when the ensemble size equals $T$. This insight allows our analysis framework to derive a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ for LinPHE, independent of the number of arms. Our techniques advance the theoretical foundation of ensemble sampling, bringing its regret bounds in line with the best known bounds for other randomized exploration algorithms.

<title>Counterfactual Uncertainty Quantification of Factual Estimand of Efficacy from Before-and-After Treatment Repeated Measures Randomized Controlled Trials</title>

Abstract: This article quantifies the uncertainty reduction achievable for \textit{counterfactual} estimand, and cautions against potential bias when the estimand uses Digital Twins. Posed by Neyman (1923a) who showed unbiased \textit{point estimation} from designed \textit{factual} experiments is possible, \textit{counterfactual} uncertainty quantification (CUQ) remained an open challenge for about one hundred years. The $Rx: C$ \textit{counterfactual} efficacy we focus on is the ideal estimand for comparing treatment $Rx$ with control $C$, the expected outcome differential if each patient received \textit{both} $Rx$ and $C$. Enabled by our new statistical modeling principle called ETZ, we show CUQ is achievable in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) with \textit{Before-and-After} Repeated Measures, common in many therapeutic areas. The CUQ we are able to achieve typically has lower variability than factual UQ.
  We caution against using predictors with measurement error, which violates regression assumptions and can cause \textit{attenuation} bias in estimating treatment effects. For traditional medicine and population-averaged targeted therapy, counterfactual point estimation remains unbiased. However, in both Real Human and Digital Twin approaches, estimating effects in \emph{subgroups} may suffer attenuation bias.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for developing efficient and interpretable climate emulators (CEs) for economic models of climate change. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we propose a general framework for constructing carbon-cycle emulators (CCEs) for macroeconomic models. The framework is implemented as a generalized linear multi-reservoir (box) model that conserves key physical quantities and can be customized for specific applications. We consider three versions of the CCE, which we evaluate within a simple representative agent economic model: (i) a three-box setting comparable to DICE-2016, (ii) a four-box extension, and (iii) a four-box version that explicitly captures land-use change. While the three-box model reproduces benchmark results well and the fourth reservoir adds little, incorporating the impact of land-use change on the carbon storage capacity of the terrestrial biosphere substantially alters atmospheric carbon stocks, temperature trajectories, and the optimal mitigation path. Second, we investigate pattern-scaling techniques that transform global-mean temperature projections from CEs into spatially heterogeneous warming fields. We show how regional baseline climates, non-uniform warming, and the associated uncertainties propagate into economic damages.

arXiv:2411.15769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study second-order algorithms for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, which have attracted much attention in recent years in many fields, especially in machine learning.We propose a gradient norm regularized trust-region (GRTR) algorithm to solve nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, where the objective function of the trust-region subproblem in each iteration uses a regularized version of the Hessian matrix, and the regularization coefficient and the radius of the ball constraint are proportional to the square root of the gradient norm. The iteration complexity of the proposed GRTR algorithm to obtain an $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary point is proved to be upper bounded by $\tilde{O}(\ell^{1.5}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-1.5}\epsilon^{-1.5})$, where $\mu$ is the strong concave coefficient, $\ell$ and $\rho$ are the Lipschitz constant of the gradient and Jacobian matrix respectively, which matches the best known iteration complexity of second-order methods for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems. We further propose a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with a gradient norm regularization coefficient and use the negative curvature direction to correct the iteration direction (LMNegCur), which does not need to solve the trust-region subproblem at each iteration. We also prove that the LMNegCur algorithm achieves an $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary point within $\tilde{O}(\ell^{1.5}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-1.5}\epsilon^{-1.5})$ number of iterations.The inexact variants of both algorithms can still obtain $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary points with high probability, but only require $\tilde{O}(\ell^{2.25}\rho^{0.25}\mu^{-1.75}\epsilon^{-1.75})$ Hessian-vector products and $\tilde{O}(\ell^{2}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-2}\epsilon^{-1.5})$ gradient ascent steps.

arXiv:2411.18688v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for visual-reasoning tasks, improving their safety has become crucial. Recent research indicates that despite training-time safety alignment, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In this work, we first highlight an important safety gap to describe that alignment achieved solely through safety training may be insufficient against jailbreak attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose Immune, an inference-time defense framework that leverages a safe reward model through controlled decoding to defend against jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we provide a mathematical characterization of Immune, offering insights on why it improves safety against jailbreaks. Extensive evaluations on diverse jailbreak benchmarks using recent MLLMs reveal that Immune effectively enhances model safety while preserving the model's original capabilities. For instance, against text-based jailbreak attacks on LLaVA-1.6, Immune reduces the attack success rate by 57.82% and 16.78% compared to the base MLLM and state-of-the-art defense strategy, respectively.

Abstract: In human society, the conflict between self-interest and collective well-being often obstructs efforts to achieve shared welfare. Related concepts like the Tragedy of the Commons and Social Dilemmas frequently manifest in our daily lives. As artificial agents increasingly serve as autonomous proxies for humans, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method to address this issue - learning policies to maximise collective returns even when individual agents' interests conflict with the collective one. Unlike traditional cooperative MARL solutions that involve sharing rewards, values, and policies or designing intrinsic rewards to encourage agents to learn collectively optimal policies, we propose a novel MARL approach where agents exchange action suggestions. Our method reveals less private information compared to sharing rewards, values, or policies, while enabling effective cooperation without the need to design intrinsic rewards. Our algorithm is supported by our theoretical analysis that establishes a bound on the discrepancy between collective and individual objectives, demonstrating how sharing suggestions can align agents' behaviours with the collective objective. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs competitively with baselines that rely on value or policy sharing or intrinsic rewards.

arXiv:2412.16619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.

Abstract: While existing approaches excel at recognising current surgical phases, they provide limited foresight and intraoperative guidance into future procedural steps. Similarly, current anticipation methods are constrained to predicting short-term and single events, neglecting the dense, repetitive, and long sequential nature of surgical workflows. To address these needs and limitations, we propose SWAG (Surgical Workflow Anticipative Generation), a framework that combines phase recognition and anticipation using a generative approach. This paper investigates two distinct decoding methods - single-pass (SP) and auto-regressive (AR) - to generate sequences of future surgical phases at minute intervals over long horizons. We propose a novel embedding approach using class transition probabilities to enhance the accuracy of phase anticipation. Additionally, we propose a generative framework using remaining time regression to classification (R2C). SWAG was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, Cholec80 and AutoLaparo21. Our single-pass model with class transition probability embeddings (SP*) achieves 32.1% and 41.3% F1 scores over 20 and 30 minutes on Cholec80 and AutoLaparo21, respectively. Moreover, our approach competes with existing methods on phase remaining time regression, achieving weighted mean absolute errors of 0.32 and 0.48 minutes for 2- and 3-minute horizons. SWAG demonstrates versatility across generative decoding frame works and classification and regression tasks to create temporal continuity between surgical workflow recognition and anticipation. Our method provides steps towards intraoperative surgical workflow generation for anticipation. Project: https://maxboels.com/research/swag.

Abstract: The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.

<title>PPO-Based Vehicle Control for Ramp Merging Scheme Assisted by Enhanced C-V2X</title>

Abstract: On-ramp merging presents a critical challenge in autonomous driving, as vehicles from merging lanes need to dynamically adjust their positions and speeds while monitoring traffic on the main road to prevent collisions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel merging control scheme based on reinforcement learning, which integrates lateral control mechanisms. This approach ensures the smooth integration of vehicles from the merging lane onto the main road, optimizing both fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Furthermore, we recognize the impact of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication on control strategies and introduce an enhanced protocol leveraging Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Mode 4. This protocol aims to reduce the Age of Information (AoI) and improve communication reliability. In our simulations, we employ two AoI-based metrics to rigorously assess the protocol's effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. By combining the NS3 network simulator with Python, we simulate V2V communication and vehicle control simultaneously. The results demonstrate that the enhanced C-V2X Mode 4 outperforms the standard version, while the proposed control scheme ensures safe and reliable vehicle operation during on-ramp merging.

<title>AirIO: Learning Inertial Odometry with Enhanced IMU Feature Observability</title>

arXiv:2501.15659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertial odometry (IO) using only Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) offers a lightweight and cost-effective solution for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, yet existing learning-based IO models often fail to generalize to UAVs due to the highly dynamic and non-linear-flight patterns that differ from pedestrian motion. In this work, we identify that the conventional practice of transforming raw IMU data to global coordinates undermines the observability of critical kinematic information in UAVs. By preserving the body-frame representation, our method achieves substantial performance improvements, with a 66.7% average increase in accuracy across three datasets. Furthermore, explicitly encoding attitude information into the motion network results in an additional 23.8% improvement over prior results. Combined with a data-driven IMU correction model (AirIMU) and an uncertainty-aware Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), our approach ensures robust state estimation under aggressive UAV maneuvers without relying on external sensors or control inputs. Notably, our method also demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen data not included in the training set, underscoring its potential for real-world UAV applications.

<title>Adversarially Robust Bloom Filters: Privacy, Reductions, and Open Problems</title>

Abstract: A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that represents a set $S$ of elements from a larger universe $U$. This efficiency comes with a trade-off, namely, it allows for a small chance of false positives. When you query the Bloom filter about an element x, the filter will respond 'Yes' if $x \in S$. If $x \notin S$, it may still respond 'Yes' with probability at most $\varepsilon$. We investigate the adversarial robustness and privacy of Bloom filters, addressing open problems across three prominent frameworks: the game-based model of Naor-Oved-Yogev (NOY), the simulator-based model of Filic et. al., and learning-augmented variants. We prove the first formal connection between the Filic and NOY models, showing that Filic correctness implies AB-test resilience. We resolve a longstanding open question by proving that PRF-backed Bloom filters fail the NOY model's stronger BP-test. Finally, we introduce the first private Bloom filters with differential privacy guarantees, including constructions applicable to learned Bloom filters. Our taxonomy organizes the space of robustness and privacy guarantees, clarifying relationships between models and constructions.

arXiv:2502.00038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of this work is a fast algorithm to compute the barycentre of a set of networks based on a Laplacian spectral pseudo-distance. The core engine for the reconstruction of the barycentre is an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases, and returns a basis that yields a sparse approximation of the sample mean adjacency matrix. We prove that when the networks are random realizations of stochastic block models, then our algorithm reconstructs the population mean adjacency matrix. In addition to the theoretical analysis of the estimator of the barycentre network, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator. This work is significant because it opens the door to the design of new spectral-based network synthesis that have theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: The field of algorithms with predictions incorporates machine learning advice in the design of online algorithms to improve real-world performance. A central consideration is the extent to which predictions can be trusted -- while existing approaches often require users to specify an aggregate trust level, modern machine learning models can provide estimates of prediction-level uncertainty. In this paper, we propose calibration as a principled and practical tool to bridge this gap, demonstrating the benefits of calibrated advice through two case studies: the ski rental and online job scheduling problems. For ski rental, we design an algorithm that achieves near-optimal prediction-dependent performance and prove that, in high-variance settings, calibrated advice offers more effective guidance than alternative methods for uncertainty quantification. For job scheduling, we demonstrate that using a calibrated predictor leads to significant performance improvements over existing methods. Evaluations on real-world data validate our theoretical findings, highlighting the practical impact of calibration for algorithms with predictions.

arXiv:2502.03919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit Blackwell's celebrated approachability problem which considers a repeated vector-valued game between a player and an adversary. Motivated by settings in which the action set of the player or adversary (or both) is difficult to optimize over, for instance when it corresponds to the set of all possible solutions to some NP-Hard optimization problem, we ask what can the player guarantee \textit{efficiently}, when only having access to these sets via approximation algorithms with ratios $\alpha_{\mX} \geq 1$ and $ 1 \geq \alpha_{\mY} > 0$, respectively. Assuming the player has monotone preferences, in the sense that he does not prefer a vector-valued loss $\ell_1$ over $\ell_2$ if $\ell_2 \leq \ell_1$, we establish that given a Blackwell instance with an approachable target set $S$, the downward closure of the appropriately-scaled set $\alpha_{\mX}\alpha_{\mY}^{-1}S$ is \textit{efficiently} approachable with optimal rate. In case only the player's or adversary's set is equipped with an approximation algorithm, we give simpler and more efficient algorithms.

<title>Robust Conformal Outlier Detection under Contaminated Reference Data</title>

arXiv:2502.04807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a flexible framework for calibrating machine learning predictions, providing distribution-free statistical guarantees. In outlier detection, this calibration relies on a reference set of labeled inlier data to control the type-I error rate. However, obtaining a perfectly labeled inlier reference set is often unrealistic, and a more practical scenario involves access to a contaminated reference set containing a small fraction of outliers. This paper analyzes the impact of such contamination on the validity of conformal methods. We prove that under realistic, non-adversarial settings, calibration on contaminated data yields conservative type-I error control, shedding light on the inherent robustness of conformal methods. This conservativeness, however, typically results in a loss of power. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel, active data-cleaning framework that leverages a limited labeling budget and an outlier detection model to selectively annotate data points in the contaminated reference set that are suspected as outliers. By removing only the annotated outliers in this ``suspicious'' subset, we can effectively enhance power while mitigating the risk of inflating the type-I error rate, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Experiments on real datasets validate the conservative behavior of conformal methods under contamination and show that the proposed data-cleaning strategy improves power without sacrificing validity.

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of offline assortment optimization under the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, where sellers must determine the optimal subset of the products to offer based solely on historical customer choice data. While most existing approaches to learning-based assortment optimization focus on the online learning of the optimal assortment through repeated interactions with customers, such exploration can be costly or even impractical in many real-world settings. In this paper, we consider the offline learning paradigm and investigate the minimal data requirements for efficient offline assortment optimization. To this end, we introduce Pessimistic Rank-Breaking (PRB), an algorithm that combines rank-breaking with pessimistic estimation. We prove that PRB is nearly minimax optimal by establishing the tight suboptimality upper bound and a nearly matching lower bound. This further shows that "optimal item coverage" - where each item in the optimal assortment appears sufficiently often in the historical data - is both sufficient and necessary for efficient offline learning. This significantly relaxes the previous requirement of observing the complete optimal assortment in the data. Our results provide fundamental insights into the data requirements for offline assortment optimization under the MNL model.

arXiv:2502.09604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.

<title>Improved Online Confidence Bounds for Multinomial Logistic Bandits</title>

arXiv:2502.10020v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved online confidence bound for multinomial logistic (MNL) models and apply this result to MNL bandits, achieving variance-dependent optimal regret. Recently, Lee & Oh (2024) established an online confidence bound for MNL models and achieved nearly minimax-optimal regret in MNL bandits. However, their results still depend on the norm-boundedness of the unknown parameter $B$ and the maximum size of possible outcomes $K$. To address this, we first derive an online confidence bound of $O\left(\sqrt{d \log t} + B \sqrt{d} \right)$, which is a significant improvement over the previous bound of $O (B \sqrt{d} \log t \log K )$ (Lee & Oh, 2024). This is mainly achieved by establishing tighter self-concordant properties of the MNL loss and applying Ville's inequality to bound the estimation error. Using this new online confidence bound, we propose a constant-time algorithm, OFU-MNL++, which achieves a variance-dependent regret bound of $O \Big( d \log T \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $ for sufficiently large $T$, where $\sigma_t^2$ denotes the variance of the rewards at round $t$, $d$ is the dimension of the contexts, and $T$ is the total number of rounds. Furthermore, we introduce a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)-based algorithm, OFU-MN$^2$L, which achieves an anytime poly(B)-free regret of $O \Big( d \log (BT) \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $.

Abstract: Estimating the causal effects of an intervention on outcomes is crucial to policy and decision-making. But often, information about outcomes can be missing or subject to non-standard measurement error. It may be possible to reveal ground-truth outcome information at a cost, for example via data annotation or follow-up; but budget constraints entail that only a fraction of the dataset can be labeled. In this setting, we optimize which data points should be sampled for outcome information and, therefore, efficient average treatment effect estimation with missing data. We do so by allocating data annotation in batches. We extend to settings where outcomes may be recorded in unstructured data that can be annotated at a cost, such as text or images, for example, in healthcare or social services. Our motivating application is a collaboration with a street outreach provider with millions of case notes, where it is possible to expertly label some, but not all, ground-truth outcomes. We demonstrate how expert labels and noisy imputed labels can be combined efficiently and responsibly into a doubly robust causal estimator. We run experiments on simulated data and two real-world datasets, including one on street outreach interventions in homelessness services, to show the versatility of our proposed method.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs), possibly using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for simultaneous route optimization, may destabilize traffic networks, with human drivers potentially experiencing longer travel times. We study this interaction by simulating human drivers and AVs. Our experiments with standard MARL algorithms reveal that, both in simplified and complex networks, policies often fail to converge to an optimal solution or require long training periods. This problem is amplified by the fact that we cannot rely entirely on simulated training, as there are no accurate models of human routing behavior. At the same time, real-world training in cities risks destabilizing urban traffic systems, increasing externalities, such as $CO_2$ emissions, and introducing non-stationarity as human drivers will adapt unpredictably to AV behaviors. In this position paper, we argue that city authorities must collaborate with the ML community to monitor and critically evaluate the routing algorithms proposed by car companies toward fair and system-efficient routing algorithms and regulatory standards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in vision-language tasks, but their application in the medical field remains underexplored, particularly for integrating structured time series data with unstructured clinical notes. In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Motivated by the prevalence of prediction problems in the economy, we study markets in which firms sell models to a consumer to help improve their prediction. Firms decide whether to enter, choose models to train on their data, and set prices. The consumer can purchase multiple models and use a weighted average of the models bought. Market outcomes can be expressed in terms of the \emph{bias-variance decompositions} of the models that firms sell. We give conditions when symmetric firms will choose different modeling techniques, e.g., each using only a subset of available covariates. We also show firms can choose inefficiently biased models or inefficiently costly models to deter entry by competitors.

Abstract: In modern world the importance of cybersecurity of various systems is increasing from year to year. The number of information security events generated by information security tools grows up with the development of the IT infrastructure. At the same time, the cyber threat landscape does not remain constant, and monitoring should take into account both already known attack indicators and those for which there are no signature rules in information security products of various classes yet. Detecting anomalies in large cybersecurity data streams is a complex task that, if properly addressed, can allow for timely response to atypical and previously unknown cyber threats. The possibilities of using of offline algorithms may be limited for a number of reasons related to the time of training and the frequency of retraining. Using stream learning algorithms for solving this task is capable of providing near-real-time data processing. This article examines the results of ten algorithms from three Python stream machine-learning libraries on BETH dataset with cybersecurity events, which contains information about the creation, cloning, and destruction of operating system processes collected using extended eBPF. ROC-AUC metric and total processing time of processing with these algorithms are presented. Several combinations of features and the order of events are considered. In conclusion, some mentions are given about the most promising algorithms and possible directions for further research are outlined.

Abstract: Multivariate cortico-muscular analysis has recently emerged as a promising approach for evaluating the corticospinal neural pathway. However, current multivariate approaches encounter challenges such as high dimensionality and limited sample sizes, thus restricting their further applications. In this paper, we propose a structured and sparse partial least squares coherence algorithm (ssPLSC) to extract shared latent space representations related to cortico-muscular interactions. Our approach leverages an embedded optimization framework by integrating a partial least squares (PLS)-based objective function, a sparsity constraint and a connectivity-based structured constraint, addressing the generalizability, interpretability and spatial structure. To solve the optimization problem, we develop an efficient alternating iterative algorithm within a unified framework and prove its convergence experimentally. Extensive experimental results from one synthetic and several real-world datasets have demonstrated that ssPLSC can achieve competitive or better performance over some representative multivariate cortico-muscular fusion methods, particularly in scenarios characterized by limited sample sizes and high noise levels. This study provides a novel multivariate fusion method for cortico-muscular analysis, offering a transformative tool for the evaluation of corticospinal pathway integrity in neurological disorders.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI assistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current state-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high operational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address these issues, we propose Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an innovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with dynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures task-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced through external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts. Such structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost models to solve complex tasks effectively while also minimizing bias and noise. For example, KGoT achieves a 29% improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging Face Agents with GPT-4o mini. Moreover, harnessing a smaller model dramatically reduces operational costs by over 36x compared to GPT-4o. Improvements for other models (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B) and benchmarks (e.g., SimpleQA) are similar. KGoT offers a scalable, affordable, versatile, and high-performing solution for AI assistants.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to progressive cognitive decline, making early detection crucial for effective intervention. While deep learning models have shown high accuracy in AD diagnosis, their lack of interpretability limits clinical trust and adoption. This paper introduces a novel pre-model approach leveraging Jacobian Maps (JMs) within a multi-modal framework to enhance explainability and trustworthiness in AD detection. By capturing localized brain volume changes, JMs establish meaningful correlations between model predictions and well-known neuroanatomical biomarkers of AD. We validate JMs through experiments comparing a 3D CNN trained on JMs versus on traditional preprocessed data, which demonstrates superior accuracy. We also employ 3D Grad-CAM analysis to provide both visual and quantitative insights, further showcasing improved interpretability and diagnostic reliability.

Abstract: In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern the pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy of drugs, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.

<title>On Synthesizing Data for Context Attribution in Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) accounts for a significant portion of LLM usage "in the wild". However, LLMs sometimes produce false or misleading responses, also known as "hallucinations". Therefore, grounding the generated answers in contextually provided information -- i.e., providing evidence for the generated text -- is paramount for LLMs' trustworthiness. Providing this information is the task of context attribution. In this paper, we systematically study LLM-based approaches for this task, namely we investigate (i) zero-shot inference, (ii) LLM ensembling, and (iii) fine-tuning of small LMs on synthetic data generated by larger LLMs. Our key contribution is SynQA: a novel generative strategy for synthesizing context attribution data. Given selected context sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these sentences. This leverages LLMs' natural strengths in text generation while ensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that the attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning small LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains. Finally, with a user study, we validate the usefulness of small LMs (fine-tuned on synthetic data from SynQA) in context attribution for QA.

Abstract: We review the literature on algorithms for estimating the index space in a multi-index model. The primary focus is on computationally efficient (polynomial-time) algorithms in Gaussian space, the assumptions under which consistency is guaranteed by these methods, and their sample complexity. In many cases, a gap is observed between the sample complexity of the best known computationally efficient methods and the information-theoretical minimum. We also review algorithms based on estimating the span of gradients using nonparametric methods, and algorithms based on fitting neural networks using gradient descent

Abstract: Mechanical search (MS) in cluttered environments remains a significant challenge for autonomous manipulators, requiring long-horizon planning and robust state estimation under occlusions and partial observability. In this work, we introduce XPG-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to efficiently perform MS tasks through explainable, priority-guided decision-making based on raw sensory inputs. XPG-RL integrates a task-driven action prioritization mechanism with a learned context-aware switching strategy that dynamically selects from a discrete set of action primitives such as target grasping, occlusion removal, and viewpoint adjustment. Within this strategy, a policy is optimized to output adaptive threshold values that govern the discrete selection among action primitives. The perception module fuses RGB-D inputs with semantic and geometric features to produce a structured scene representation for downstream decision-making. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that XPG-RL consistently outperforms baseline methods in task success rates and motion efficiency, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ higher efficiency in long-horizon tasks. These results underscore the benefits of integrating domain knowledge with learnable decision-making policies for robust and efficient robotic manipulation. The project page for XPG-RL is https://yitingzhang1997.github.io/xpgrl/.

Abstract: After two years of appearance, COVID-19 has negatively affected people and normal life around the world. As in May 2022, there are more than 522 million cases and six million deaths worldwide (including nearly ten million cases and over forty-three thousand deaths in Vietnam). Economy and society are both severely affected. The variant of COVID-19, Omicron, has broken disease prevention measures of countries and rapidly increased number of infections. Resources overloading in treatment and epidemics prevention is happening all over the world. It can be seen that, application of artificial intelligence (AI) to support people at this time is extremely necessary. There have been many studies applying AI to prevent COVID-19 which are extremely useful, and studies on machine reading comprehension (MRC) are also in it. Realizing that, we created the first MRC dataset about COVID-19 for Vietnamese: ViQA-COVID and can be used to build models and systems, contributing to disease prevention. Besides, ViQA-COVID is also the first multi-span extraction MRC dataset for Vietnamese, we hope that it can contribute to promoting MRC studies in Vietnamese and multilingual.

Abstract: Humans make extensive use of haptic exploration to map and identify the properties of the objects that we touch. In robotics, active tactile perception has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task. These findings underscore the potential of TAP as a versatile and generalizable framework for advancing active tactile perception in robotics.

Abstract: Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes. Code and videos are available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Sim/.

Abstract: Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.

Abstract: Calibration is a critical requirement for reliable probabilistic prediction, especially in high-risk applications. However, the theoretical understanding of which learning algorithms can simultaneously achieve high accuracy and good calibration remains limited, and many existing studies provide empirical validation or a theoretical guarantee in restrictive settings. To address this issue, in this work, we focus on the smooth calibration error (CE) and provide a uniform convergence bound, showing that the smooth CE is bounded by the sum of the smooth CE over the training dataset and a generalization gap. We further prove that the functional gradient of the loss function can effectively control the training smooth CE. Based on this framework, we analyze three representative algorithms: gradient boosting trees, kernel boosting, and two-layer neural networks. For each, we derive conditions under which both classification and calibration performances are simultaneously guaranteed. Our results offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing reliable probabilistic models with provable calibration guarantees.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.

Abstract: The basic question of delineating those statistical problems that are solvable without making any assumptions on the underlying data distribution has long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a convex M-estimation or stochastic optimization problem is solvable in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework in generative modeling, typically relying on optimizing neural networks to estimate the score function via forward SDE simulations. In this work, we propose an alternative method that is both optimization-free and forward SDE-free. By expanding the score function in a sparse set of eigenbasis of the backward Kolmogorov operator associated with the diffusion process, we reformulate score estimation as the solution to a linear system, avoiding iterative optimization and time-dependent sample generation. We analyze the approximation error using perturbation theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-dimensional Boltzmann distributions and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features. We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference over arguments and the relations between them.

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6% localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists' acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of 74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer screening workflows in clinical practice.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC) aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering, and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis. In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean, variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

<title>Tactile MNIST: Benchmarking Active Tactile Perception</title>

Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600 real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile sensing and active perception.

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets, suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than existing methods.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic, completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and (2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and $10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/bingreeky/GMemory.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting information and it remains unclear how models should address such discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

<title>Segment Concealed Objects with Incomplete Supervision</title>

arXiv:2506.08955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments, utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing the performance of existing models.

<div> scaling, LLM reasoning, test-time, in-context exploration, extrapolation

Summary: 
The research focuses on improving LLM reasoning through test-time scaling and in-context exploration to enable extrapolation capabilities for better performance on challenging problems beyond the training token budget. The proposed e3 recipe involves training the LLM to chain operations like verification and generation, amplifying exploration through negative gradients from incorrect traces, and coupling task difficulty with token budget via a structured curriculum. The e3-1.7B model outperforms existing models in AIME'25 and HMMT'25 scores, achieving 2x extrapolation of the training token budget. This model excels in pass@1 scores and enhances pass@k performance compared to the base model. The study highlights the importance of in-context exploration in enhancing LLM reasoning and sets a new standard for performance in reasoning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.09026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging "negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL, resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3) coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25 scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally, hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Summary:
This manuscript introduces the concept of essential data science as a holistic view of the data universe, incorporating 5D complexities and the data life cycle. Data agents, driven by specific goals, perform tasks within this ecosystem. The abstract entity of a data scientist emerges from the logical organization of these data agents. Discipline-induced data science leads to pan-data science, integrating specific disciplines with essential data science. The essential data science is split into computational and foundational components, with a potential divergence between the two. The authors propose that the usefulness of data universe discoveries should be rigorously measured to prevent this divergence. By emphasizing the importance of assessing the utility of data discoveries, the manuscript aims to maintain cohesion within the field of data science.

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges that are defined according to the missions. We define specific discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially, if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the challenges of privacy concerns and high transmission costs in centralized training of foundation models by exploring the potential of federated learning (FL) and personalized federated learning (PFL). They introduce a new benchmark for multi-modal PFL that includes 40 diverse tasks with realistic data distribution shifts. To handle data heterogeneity, they propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method to provide customized global models to individual clients. Additionally, they address model heterogeneity by introducing a dimension-invariant module for knowledge sharing across heterogeneous models.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes, personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential, most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast, we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and generalization capabilities.

Summary:<br />
This paper explores the impact of algorithmic lookism on gender classification algorithms and synthetically generated faces. The study conducted experiments with 13,200 synthetic faces and discovered that text-to-image systems often correlate facial attractiveness with unrelated positive traits such as intelligence and trustworthiness. Additionally, gender classification models displayed higher error rates when classifying "less-attractive" faces, particularly among non-White women. These findings raise concerns about fairness in digital identity systems and highlight the biases present in machine learning algorithms. The research underscores the importance of addressing algorithmic discrimination and ensuring equity and inclusivity in artificial intelligence technologies. <div>

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with 13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I) systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among non-White women.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of dynamic Time-of-Use (dToU) electricity tariffs requires accurately identifying households that would benefit from such pricing structures. However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods, Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN), Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, under different synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role: diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the potential of structured generative models for developing privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case -- given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop. Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy. Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

Summary:  
YingLong, a novel joint forecasting framework for time series prediction, utilizes a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer trained through masked token recovery. The framework demonstrates a unique scaling effect where longer outputs significantly enhance model accuracy, attributed to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning. By addressing output variance through a multi-input ensemble, YingLong achieves state-of-the-art performance with models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters. The performance of YingLong surpasses that of other models in zero-shot tasks on ETT and Weather datasets, with more than 60% best performance. Evaluation on the GIFT-Eval benchmark of 23 time series datasets across 7 domains shows YingLong's superiority over other time-series foundation models, outperforming end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank respectively. The pretrained 300M model is publicly available for further research and applications.

YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time series datasets across 7 domains.

Summary: 
Forward Target Propagation (FTP) is proposed as an alternative to backpropagation for training neural networks, addressing limitations such as non-local credit assignment and frozen activity during backward passes. FTP performs a second forward pass to estimate layerwise targets, eliminating the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions. This enables modular and local learning, making it biologically plausible and computationally efficient. FTP achieves competitive accuracies with backpropagation on various datasets and effectively models long-term dependencies in sequential tasks. It outperforms backpropagation under quantized low-precision and emerging hardware constraints, and is more efficient than other biologically inspired methods. With minimal computational overhead, a forward-only approach, and compatibility with hardware, FTP is suitable for energy-efficient on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment, and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms.

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large, curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1 scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects, and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations -- suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting. Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases -- indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

Summary:<br /><br />
Variations in hidden parameters can pose safety risks during robot execution. In this study, a runtime shielding mechanism for reinforcement learning is developed to address this issue by utilizing constrained hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time inference of hidden parameters, allowing for adaptation of the shield and underlying policy online.

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while incurring minimal runtime overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability. Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning abilities of LVLMs.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to incorporating Tversky's axiomatic theory of similarity into deep learning models. By developing a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity, the researchers were able to create the Tversky projection layer, which outperformed traditional linear projection layers in tasks such as image recognition and language modeling. The experiments conducted on the NABirds image classification task and GPT-2 language model showed significant improvements in accuracy and perplexity, respectively. The Tversky projection layer also reduced the parameter count of the models. Additionally, the researchers proposed a unified interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input stimuli to learned prototypes, supported by a novel visualization technique. This work offers a new paradigm for designing interpretable deep learning networks based on an established theory of psychological similarity.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast, Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR. Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an established theory of psychological similarity.

The article introduces a new Interactive Cross-modal Learning (ICL) framework for text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID). It leverages human-centered interaction to enhance query discriminability through external multimodal knowledge. A Test-time Human-centered Interaction (THI) module facilitates visual question answering focused on human characteristics, refining user queries based on responses from a multimodal large language model. This boosts ranking accuracy by reducing the gap to best-matching images.

arXiv:2506.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models, existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework (ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction (THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images. Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy. Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e., CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

<div> Graph representation learning, Data scarcity, Pareto-Optimization, LifeTime Value prediction, Interdependence of tasks <br />
Summary:
The challenge of predicting LifeTime Value (LTV) for users in advertising is tackled in this study. The scarcity of data in real-world scenarios, where most users make few purchases, hinders accurate LTV prediction. Furthermore, the interdependencies among tasks with high correlation complicate the prediction process. To address these challenges, the Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV) framework is introduced. Graph representation learning is used to handle data scarcity, while Pareto-Optimization is employed to manage the interdependence of prediction tasks. By combining these techniques, the accuracy of LTV prediction in advertising scenarios can be substantially improved.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers. Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the interdependence of prediction tasks.

<div> Keywords: Class-incremental learning, pre-trained models, expert fusion, Mixture of Experts, MoTE <br />
Summary: <br />
Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn from streaming data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Existing methods based on pre-trained models (PTMs) face challenges like prompt overwriting and dimensional misalignment. This study introduces a novel approach called mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) to address these issues. MoTE leverages the concept of expert fusion while mitigating inconsistencies in output dimensions across tasks. By incorporating task-aware expert filtering and reliable expert joint inference, MoTE improves model performance without catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, the scalability of MoTE is demonstrated, offering a trade-off between adapter expansion and model performance. The proposed Adapter-Limited MoTE further explores this trade-off, providing a promising solution for efficient and effective class-incremental learning. The code for MoTE is publicly available for reference and replication. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models (PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE. The code is available at https://github.com/Franklilinjie/MoTE.

Summary:
Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) is introduced as a solution to color distortions in text-to-image latent diffusion models caused by high guidance weights in Classifier-free guidance (CFG). The theoretical framework explains how norm amplification in the latent space leads to color distortions during image synthesis. ADG algorithm optimizes angular alignment while constraining magnitude variations, balancing enhanced text-image alignment with reduced color distortions. Experimental results show that ADG outperforms existing methods, producing images with superior text alignment, improved color fidelity, and alignment with human perceptual preferences. ADG provides a significant advancement in image synthesis by preserving text-image alignment quality while mitigating color distortions, enhancing the overall visual output quality in latent diffusion models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS) and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information, GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from $W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods, offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

Summary:
Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs) have shown significant success, but there is a need for more compressed models. This paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs quantization to alleviate quantization error by constraining weight perturbation within the null space of input activations. The proposed Q2N module enhances existing PTQ baselines by providing an efficient null space projection approximation method tailored to LLMs. Theoretically derived closed-form solutions ensure practical inference conditions without added memory overhead. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs validate the effectiveness of Q2N and the potential of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. This work lays the foundation for further reducing quantization error in LLMs and encourages the development of more advanced quantization methods in the future.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs) offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs. Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective of null space optimization for LLMs quantization.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional. We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset. Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

Summary: 
Data augmentation is essential for improving confidence estimation in large language models (LLMs), especially in closed-source models. Various data augmentation methods have been found to enhance performance and reduce overconfidence in LLMs. The study highlights the importance of incorporating diverse data to maintain semantic information while improving the effectiveness of augmentation. Different augmentation strategies have varying impacts depending on the application range, with random combinations showing promise for parameter transferability and usability. Overall, data augmentation can play a significant role in improving confidence estimation in LLMs and mitigating issues of overconfidence. <div>

Abstract: Confidence estimation is crucial for reflecting the reliability of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the widely used closed-source models. Utilizing data augmentation for confidence estimation is viable, but discussions focus on specific augmentation techniques, limiting its potential. We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence estimation. Our findings indicate that data augmentation strategies can achieve better performance and mitigate the impact of overconfidence. We investigate the influential factors related to this and discover that, while preserving semantic information, greater data diversity enhances the effectiveness of augmentation. Furthermore, the impact of different augmentation strategies varies across different range of application. Considering parameter transferability and usability, the random combination of augmentations is a promising choice.

<div> Framework, Bias Detection, Machine Learning, Crowdsourced, Visual Perception  
Summary:  
This paper introduces a perception-driven framework for bias detection in machine learning systems deployed in high-stakes domains. Traditional bias detection methods are limited by the need for sensitive labels and rigid fairness metrics. The framework leverages crowdsourced human judgment through a web platform displaying stripped-down visualizations of numeric data for binary judgments on group similarity. Users' visual perception cues, shaped by layout and spacing, are used to detect potential disparities. Crowd feedback flags biased data segments, which are validated through statistical tests and machine learning evaluations. Perceptual signals from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of visual intuition in fairness auditing. This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to conventional fairness diagnostics, facilitating human-aligned, crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity. We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing. This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned, crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However, traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of 98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs, compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments.

Summary:
The article introduces NSW-EPNews, a benchmark dataset for evaluating electricity price forecasting models that incorporate both time-series data and textual signals. The dataset includes spot prices from New South Wales, Australia, temperature readings, and market news summaries. The task is framed as 48-step-ahead forecasting using multimodal input.

The study highlights the gap between current LLM capabilities and the requirements of accurate energy forecasting. NSW-EPNews serves as a comprehensive testbed for evaluating numerical reasoning in multimodal settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews, the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia (2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences. NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for NP-hard combinatorial optimization tasks through the development of ACCORD, an autoregressive constraint-satisfying generation model. The research introduces a novel dataset representation and model architecture that utilize the autoregressive nature of LLMs to enforce feasibility constraints dynamically.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems (CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints, coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules. We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an 8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4. Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum of combinatorial optimization problems.

Summary:
In this paper, a novel User Behavior Sequence (UBS) pretraining strategy called Bootstrapping Your Behavior (model) is introduced. This strategy eliminates the need for manual behavior vocabulary selection by predicting an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all behaviors within a future time window. The model incorporates a student-teacher encoder scheme for effective pretraining. Experiments on real-world industrial datasets and downstream tasks show that the model improves AUC by 3.9% and training throughput by 98.9%. The model also exhibits meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining without label supervision. In online deployment for financial risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile application, the pretrained model reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant Group, with improvements of 2.7% and 7.1% in KS over the baseline model.

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications. As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of 3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions. The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless, efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS) while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach.

Summary: <br />
Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are unlocking the potential for novel materials discovery, design, and manufacturing. However, many structural and functional materials lack large datasets for traditional machine learning approaches. This paper introduces a novel machine learning method for learning from sparse spatial data in scientific fields. The approach uses physics-driven data augmentation with an ensemble of local generative models to create a diverse dataset for polycrystalline materials. The resulting model, PolyMicros, addresses challenges in 3D experimental microscopy and provides solutions to long-standing problems. The models and datasets created are made openly available to the scientific community. <div>
arXiv:2506.11055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made, successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures). Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations, and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly available to the community.

Inverse problems are prevalent in various fields, requiring the estimation of inputs to achieve desired outcomes. While forward models have advanced in explainability, the optimization of inverse problems remains challenging for domain experts. A proposed methodology introduces explanations, generated from optimizer traces, that are easily interpretable at a domain level. By instrumenting a differentiable simulator to emit natural language events during its operations, a Language Model is utilized to create explanations post-process. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through an optimization problem and a neural network training example. This method enhances the transparency and understanding of the iterative optimization process in inverse problems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare, climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs, typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain. The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes. In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a neural network.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

Summary: 
ADAMIX introduces an adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression framework for large language models (LLMs) deployed in multi-tenant serving scenarios. The framework effectively compresses delta parameters between customized LLMs and base models, addressing the limitations of existing approaches. By deriving a mathematical quantization error model, ADAMIX implements an optimal mixed-precision bit allocation scheme through integer linear programming. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over baseline methods, particularly on tasks with large parameter norms and model deficiencies. ADAMIX outperforms Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% on AIME2024 and GQA with 7B models, respectively. This advancement in adaptive compression techniques showcases the potential for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of deploying multiple LLMs for complex reasoning tasks in various domains.

arXiv:2506.11087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users. Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model. However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work, we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

<div> Preference learning, large language models, bias mitigation, feature preservation, online learning

Summary:
The study introduces a novel framework called PFP (Preference Feature Preservation) to address challenges in preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs). PFP aims to maintain the distribution of human preference features and utilize rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. It first extracts preference features from pairwise human preference data and trains a feature classifier. By mapping appropriate preference features for new input instructions and training LLMs using the feature classifier, PFP successfully mitigates bias in preference features during online learning. The experimental results demonstrate that PFP outperforms previous preference learning methods on standard benchmarks evaluating LLM alignment. The framework shows promise in improving the performance and reliability of preference learning for LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs) simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards. This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically, PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems. Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress, these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates. Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure. Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in semantic modeling capability.

Summary: 
This study focuses on improving the efficiency of structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry through the use of machine learning models trained on simulated neutron scattering patterns. By introducing a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that leverages uncertainty sampling, the researchers were able to train models with significantly less training data while enhancing accuracy. Additionally, they developed an efficient stream-based training workflow utilizing this AL policy, resulting in a 20% reduction in training time without sacrificing accuracy. These advancements have the potential to revolutionize the time-consuming process of structure determination in neutron diffractometry, making it faster and more cost-effective. <div>

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns. The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about 20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states. PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns. Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and evolving time series dynamics.

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify coverage in offline reinforcement learning (RL) data. The exponential amplification of estimation errors due to insufficient coverage is highlighted through theoretical analysis. A new poisoning attack, the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) attack, is proposed to exploit rare decision patterns in the data and reduce coverage, leading to exacerbated distributional shifts. The attack shows that poisoning a small percentage of the dataset can significantly degrade agent performance. This study sheds light on the security risks associated with insufficient data-policy coverage in offline RL and provides insights for analyzing and safeguarding the security of such systems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack. Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes. However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable solution for optimizing production efficiency.

For each experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential for robust, real-world clinical deployment.

Summary:  
- The paper discusses fair learning algorithms that address bias in training data for dynamic decision-making systems.  
- Long-term fairness is evaluated based on the difference in expected qualification gain for different demographic groups.  
- Three components are identified to measure fairness: direct impact, delayed impact, and spurious effect on qualification gain.  
- The concept of benefit fairness, aiming to ensure equity in decision outcomes, is explored in relation to these components.  
- A balancing approach is proposed to address various fairness notions in decision-making systems.

arXiv:2506.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for balancing various fairness notions.

<div> TSFMs, Time-Series Foundation Models, univariate forecasting, covariates, generalizability, building energy management

Summary:

TSFMs, inspired by Large Language Models, have the potential to revolutionize Building Energy Management tasks by offering scalable solutions. However, current evaluation shows limited generalizability, only marginally outperforming statistical models in univariate forecasting on new datasets. Incorporating covariates in TSFMs does not improve performance compared to conventional models. While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for classification tasks, they may lag behind statistical models in forecasting when test-time fitting is required. TSFMs also struggle with diverse evaluation metrics and complex building environments. Addressing these challenges requires advancements in TSFM design to better handle covariates and incorporate context and temporal dynamics in prediction mechanisms, ultimately leading to more adaptable and scalable solutions for Building Energy Management. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets, have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions: (1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited} generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates. While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design, particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and scalable solutions for BEM.

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel approach to synthesizing data using a guided diffusion model that incorporates domain-specific constraints, particularly in the context of power systems. The rising demand for synthetic data across various domains due to privacy and security concerns makes generative models an attractive solution. By integrating domain knowledge directly into the generative process, the proposed model can generate statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets while satisfying domain constraints such as Kirchhoff laws. The guidance mechanism, implemented as a gradient-based approach, helps steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction, enhancing the effectiveness of the synthesis process. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, highlighting its potential applicability beyond power systems to other domains that involve tabular data. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance, and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

arXiv:2506.11315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches, such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions. First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown, evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula (BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads, enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and interpretable machine learning.

Summary:
In this study, the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization is analyzed when problem parameters are unknown. Two strategies are explored: a model selection method to avoid overfitting the validation set and a regularization-based approach tailored for cases where only the distance to optimality is unknown. The model selection method aids in mitigating overfitting in few-shot learning experiments on CIFAR-10. The methods presented allow for tuning the learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match optimal sample complexity and adapting to unknown problem structures. Additionally, a separation between sample and computational complexity in parameter-free stochastic convex optimization is demonstrated. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in adapting to various problem structures and optimizing performance in optimization tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization. Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple problem structures.
  Experiments performing few-shot learning on CIFAR-10 by fine-tuning CLIP models and prompt engineering Gemini to count shapes indicate that our reliable model selection method can help mitigate overfitting to small validation sets.

Summary:<br /><br />Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, leading to decreased generalization on diverse scenarios. The proposed Evidential Alignment framework leverages uncertainty quantification to understand model behavior without the need for group annotations. By quantifying the evidence of model predictions and calibrating with evidential calibration, the method identifies and suppresses spurious correlations while preserving core features. The approach is theoretically justified in learning biased model patterns and debiasing without spurious correlation annotations. Empirical results show significant improvements in group robustness, making the framework a scalable and principled solution for addressing spurious correlations in deep learning models. <div>
arXiv:2506.11347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e., superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities, providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper presents a generalization bound for gradient flow that utilizes the loss path kernel (LPK), a data-dependent kernel capturing the entire training trajectory. The bound aligns with Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel methods, offering tighter and more informative generalization guarantees. It emphasizes the influence of the norm of training loss gradients on final generalization performance. By combining stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher complexity, the bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for overparameterized neural networks, demonstrating the feature learning capability of neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets validate the correlation between the proposed bound and the true generalization gap.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success, yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization gap.

<title>EDN: A Novel Edge-Dependent Noise Model for Graph Data</title>

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in noisy environments.

<title>The Effect of Stochasticity in Score-Based Diffusion Sampling: a KL Divergence Analysis</title>

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

<title>FIGNN: Feature-Specific Interpretability for Graph Neural Network Surrogate Models</title>

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark. Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature. Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

<title>LoRA Users Beware: A Few Spurious Tokens Can Manipulate Your Finetuned Model</title>

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second, for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence improving robustness.

<title>Byzantine Outside, Curious Inside: Reconstructing Data Through Malicious Updates</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client, where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server- and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by 10-15%.

<title>Bias Amplification in RAG: Poisoning Knowledge Retrieval to Steer LLMs</title>

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims, causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness issues of the RAG system.

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC), which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising 706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and 16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications, respectively.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However, formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process, demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts, matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with 90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is available at https://github.com/horizon-research/DynaDiag/.

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples. Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality, widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability, we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/RollingQ_ICML2025.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To facilitate future work, we will release code.

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the need for a greater emphasis on early detection and proactive management to avert or mitigate the severe health complications of this disease. Over recent years, machine learning algorithms have shown promising potential in predicting diabetes risk and are beneficial for practitioners. Objective: This study highlights the prediction capabilities of statistical and non-statistical machine learning methods over Diabetes risk classification in 768 samples from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It consists of the significant demographic and clinical features of age, body mass index (BMI) and blood glucose levels that greatly depend on the vulnerability against Diabetes. The experimentation assesses the various types of machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and effectiveness regarding diabetes prediction. These algorithms include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network Models. The results show that the Neural Network algorithm gained the highest predictive accuracy with 78,57 %, and then the Random Forest algorithm had the second position with 76,30 % accuracy. These findings show that machine learning techniques are not just highly effective. Still, they also can potentially act as early screening tools in predicting Diabetes within a data-driven fashion with valuable information on who is more likely to get affected. In addition, this study can help to realize the potential of machine learning for timely intervention over the longer term, which is a step towards reducing health outcomes and disease burden attributable to Diabetes on healthcare systems

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR. All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC) values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases. Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

<title>Prioritizing Alignment Paradigms over Task-Specific Model Customization in Time-Series LLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications, including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain, characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm. Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms and outline promising research directions.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret, improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation (KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data, accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions. Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables, by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI) transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state (vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability across various scenarios.

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However, real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.

<title>Improving Multimodal Learning Balance and Sufficiency through Data Remixing</title>

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories, including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately 6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

<title>Learn to Preserve Personality: Federated Foundation Models in Recommendations</title>

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques. Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes. Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their personalized agents.

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data. These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence, Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature, there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation). Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e., influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in misleading influence attribution.

<title>KCES: Training-Free Defense for Robust Graph Neural Networks via Kernel Complexity</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small, imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework. KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned. A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected, demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research. Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment risks in LLMs.

<title>Machine Unlearning for Robust DNNs: Attribution-Guided Partitioning and Neuron Pruning in Noisy Environments</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a 10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it, we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate misalignment more generally.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes, capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge. A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies: the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

<title>Geometry-Aware Edge Pooling for Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii) preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training. We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room and 72% on Ant.

<title>Taxonomy of reduction matrices for Graph Coarsening</title>

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix, which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened graphs.

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data, particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

<title>Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench, we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

arXiv:2506.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops. Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values, Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation, and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL) framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved from 71.44% to 73.21%.

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

<title>Attention-based Adversarial Robust Distillation in Radio Signal Classifications for Low-Power IoT Devices</title>

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks. The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer from the transferability of adversarial examples.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of tasks.

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering, which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian optimization problems.

<title>A Neural Rejection System Against Universal Adversarial Perturbations in Radio Signal Classification</title>

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent, hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model, which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching. Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL, highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/TreeRL.

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70 elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra, as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<title>Breaking Habits: On the Role of the Advantage Function in Learning Causal State Representations</title>

arXiv:2506.11912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

arXiv:2506.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

<title>Self-Regulating Cars: Automating Traffic Control in Free Flow Road Networks</title>

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed, signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory, gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained environments must balance efficiency and robustness. Existing methods treat compression and certified robustness as separate goals, compromising either efficiency or safety. We propose CACTUS (Compression Aware Certified Training Using network Sets), a general framework for unifying these objectives during training. CACTUS models maintain high certified accuracy even when compressed. We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high accuracy and certifiable robustness. CACTUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of datasets and input specifications.

Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations, and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes: a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode (D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at: https://github.com/ml-jku/plstm_experiments.

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer states (called checkpoints) obtained at different stages during a neural network training process. First, we propose a prediction-based compression approach, where values from the previously saved checkpoint are used for context modeling in arithmetic coding. Second, in order to enhance the compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it suitable for storage-limited environments.

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions. Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling, sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations, together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios.

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development, enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However, fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set. Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module, which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities. Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to individual users.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Abstract: With the pervasive integration of computer applications across industries, the presence of vulnerabilities within code bases poses significant risks. The diversity of software ecosystems coupled with the intricate nature of modern software engineering has led to a shift from manual code vulnerability identification towards the adoption of automated tools. Among these, deep learning-based approaches have risen to prominence due to their superior accuracy; however, these methodologies encounter several obstacles. Primarily, they necessitate extensive labeled datasets and prolonged training periods, and given the rapid emergence of new vulnerabilities, the frequent retraining of models becomes a resource-intensive endeavor, thereby limiting their applicability in cutting-edge scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces the \underline{\textbf{YOTO}}--\underline{\textbf{Y}}ou \underline{\textbf{O}}nly \underline{\textbf{T}}rain \underline{\textbf{O}}nce framework. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of multiple types of vulnerability detection models via parameter fusion, eliminating the need for joint training. Consequently, YOTO enables swift adaptation to newly discovered vulnerabilities, significantly reducing both the time and computational resources required for model updates.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability, safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and risk assessment.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial code "improvements".

Abstract: In this work we propose an energy functional along the lines of Modern Hopfield Networks (MNH), the stationary points of which correspond to the attention due to Vaswani et al. [12], thus unifying both frameworks. The minima of this landscape form "context wells" - stable configurations that encapsulate the contextual relationships among tokens. A compelling picture emerges: across $n$ token embeddings an energy landscape is defined whose gradient corresponds to the attention computation. Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to enhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling tasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning of representations, and overall efficiency and performance. A rough analogy can be seen via cubic splines which offer a richer representation of non-linear data where a simpler linear model may be inadequate. This approach can be used for the introduction of non-linear heads in transformer based models such as BERT, [6], etc.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks, including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code detectors.

Abstract: Recordings gathered with child-worn devices promised to revolutionize both fundamental and applied speech sciences by allowing the effortless capture of children's naturalistic speech environment and language production. This promise hinges on speech technologies that can transform the sheer mounds of data thus collected into usable information. This paper demonstrates several obstacles blocking progress by summarizing three years' worth of experiments aimed at improving one fundamental task: Voice Type Classification. Our experiments suggest that improvements in representation features, architecture, and parameter search contribute to only marginal gains in performance. More progress is made by focusing on data relevance and quantity, which highlights the importance of collecting data with appropriate permissions to allow sharing.

Abstract: Audio-recordings collected with a child-worn device are a fundamental tool in child language research. Long-form recordings collected over whole days promise to capture children's input and production with minimal observer bias, and therefore high validity. The sheer volume of resulting data necessitates automated analysis to extract relevant metrics for researchers and clinicians. This paper summarizes collective knowledge on this technique, providing entry points to existing resources. We also highlight various sources of error that threaten the accuracy of automated annotations and the interpretation of resulting metrics. To address this, we propose potential troubleshooting metrics to help users assess data quality. While a fully automated quality control system is not feasible, we outline practical strategies for researchers to improve data collection and contextualize their analyses.

Abstract: The expanding Lean 4 ecosystem poses challenges for navigating its vast libraries. This paper introduces LeanExplore, a search engine for Lean 4 declarations. LeanExplore enables users to semantically search for statements, both formally and informally, across select Lean 4 packages (including Batteries, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, and Std). This search capability is powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code, docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+ for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API (https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for building theorem-proving agents. This work details LeanExplore's architecture, data processing, functionalities, and its potential to enhance Lean 4 workflows and AI-driven mathematical research

<title>AssertBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Self-Assertion in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each (evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules, the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA, while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper, we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling, which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference, with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights, and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension, confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native fuzzy learning frameworks.

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific and engineering applications.

<title>HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data</title>

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings, enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and GRN-based representations.

Abstract: The rise of GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) has driven the widespread adoption of parallel programming models such as CUDA. Yet, the inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation. Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1. Our code is available at https://github.com/kcxain/musl.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the efficacy and utility of recent advances in non-local, non-linear image interpolation and extrapolation algorithms, specifically, ideas based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), as a tool for analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. We seek to utilize the microarray gene expression data sparsely sampled in the healthy human brain, and produce fully resolved spatial maps of any given gene across the whole brain at a voxel-level resolution. To do so, we first obtained the 100 top AD risk genes, whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). We adapted Implicit Neural Representation models so that the pipeline can produce robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of all genes. We present a variety of experiments using interpolations obtained from Abagen as a baseline/reference.

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the performance of several VLMs on it.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images, we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers, faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and intelligent home systems, highlighting their potential for unobtrusive activity recognition.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on 28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S., South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based clinical research.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes, and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles. Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11 achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

<title>Measuring multi-calibration</title>

Abstract: A suitable scalar metric can help measure multi-calibration, defined as follows. When the expected values of observed responses are equal to corresponding predicted probabilities, the probabilistic predictions are known as "perfectly calibrated." When the predicted probabilities are perfectly calibrated simultaneously across several subpopulations, the probabilistic predictions are known as "perfectly multi-calibrated." In practice, predicted probabilities are seldom perfectly multi-calibrated, so a statistic measuring the distance from perfect multi-calibration is informative. A recently proposed metric for calibration, based on the classical Kuiper statistic, is a natural basis for a new metric of multi-calibration and avoids well-known problems of metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation. The newly proposed metric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to their signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the metric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric. Numerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.

<title>Lifting Data-Tracing Machine Unlearning to Knowledge-Tracing for Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies. Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs, which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs (should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine unlearning paradigm.

<title>Demonstration Sidetracks: Categorizing Systematic Non-Optimality in Human Demonstrations</title>

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks (Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users' control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at https://github.com/AABL-Lab/Human-Demonstration-Sidetracks.

Abstract: With the recent rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need of selecting high-quality dataset to improve machine learning models has garnered increasing attention. However, some part of this topic remains underexplored, even for simple prediction models. In this work, we study the problem of developing practical algorithms that select appropriate dataset to minimize population loss of our prediction model with high probability. Broadly speaking, we investigate when datasets from different sources can be effectively merged to enhance the predictive model's performance, and propose a practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees. By leveraging an oracle inequality and data-driven estimators, the algorithm reduces population loss with high probability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in both standard linear regression and broader machine learning applications.

<title>Learning a Continue-Thinking Token for Enhanced Test-Time Scaling</title>

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing "" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement. For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3% absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a 4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

<title>Joint Denoising of Cryo-EM Projection Images using Polar Transformers</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however, datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

<title>Shapley Machine: A Game-Theoretic Framework for N-Agent Ad Hoc Teamwork</title>

Abstract: Open multi-agent systems are increasingly important in modeling real-world applications, such as smart grids, swarm robotics, etc. In this paper, we aim to investigate a recently proposed problem for open multi-agent systems, referred to as n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where only a number of agents are controlled. Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and consequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among agents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens of cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open multi-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a space of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend this space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios, thereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis game values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons, we represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\lambda$-returns. Furthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the controlled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team. Different from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an explicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely describing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To estimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\lambda$)-like algorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to as Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the concepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and verify reasonableness of our theory.

<title>Score-based Generative Diffusion Models to Synthesize Full-dose FDG Brain PET from MRI in Epilepsy Patients</title>

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

<title>SwiftSpec: Ultra-Low Latency LLM Decoding by Scaling Asynchronous Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs remains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding (which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor parallelism has each accelerated decoding. However, conventional approaches fail to apply both simultaneously due to imbalanced compute requirements (between draft and target models), KV-cache inconsistencies, and communication overheads under small-batch tensor-parallelism. This paper introduces SwiftSpec, a system that targets ultra-low latency for LLM decoding. SwiftSpec redesigns the speculative decoding pipeline in an asynchronous and disaggregated manner, so that each component can be scaled flexibly and remove draft overhead from the critical path. To realize this design, SwiftSpec proposes parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and fused, latency-optimized kernels to overcome the challenges listed above. Across 5 model families and 6 datasets, SwiftSpec achieves an average of 1.75x speedup over state-of-the-art speculative decoding systems and, as a highlight, serves Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, making it the fastest known system for low-latency LLM serving at this scale.

Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-efficient deep neural network (DNN), optimized through hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS); the DNN supports the classification of session-level encrypted traffic on resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices. Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters, 10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75% yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic within strict hardware limitations.

Abstract: Crystalline materials can form different structural arrangements (i.e. polymorphs) with the same chemical composition, exhibiting distinct physical properties depending on how they were synthesized or the conditions under which they operate. For example, carbon can exist as graphite (soft, conductive) or diamond (hard, insulating). Computational methods that can predict these polymorphs are vital in materials science, which help understand stability relationships, guide synthesis efforts, and discover new materials with desired properties without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However, effective crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms for inorganic polymorph structures remain limited. We propose ParetoCSP2, a multi-objective genetic algorithm for polymorphism CSP that incorporates an adaptive space group diversity control technique, preventing over-representation of any single space group in the population guided by a neural network interatomic potential. Using an improved population initialization method and performing iterative structure relaxation, ParetoCSP2 not only alleviates premature convergence but also achieves improved convergence speed. Our results show that ParetoCSP2 achieves excellent performance in polymorphism prediction, including a nearly perfect space group and structural similarity accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs but with the same number of unit cell atoms. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset, it outperforms baseline algorithms by factors of 2.46-8.62 for these accuracies and improves by 44.8\%-87.04\% across key performance metrics for regular CSP. Our source code is freely available at https://github.com/usccolumbia/ParetoCSP2.

Abstract: Studying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling partial differential equations to solve the acoustic wave field has produced promising results for simple geometries in two-dimensional domains. One option is to compute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to existing numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem has to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization toward the "true" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical dimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a self-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of sound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave field by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution, we study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition and the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound model to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence behavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$ error compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network architecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least six training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and subsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative aiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including absorbers.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online recommendation services.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable outcome rewards have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification, leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks, where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead: choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over the original p-KGFN algorithm.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC), and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode, where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously. Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46% under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

Abstract: Text-to-audio diffusion models produce high-quality and diverse music but many, if not most, of the SOTA models lack the fine-grained, time-varying controls essential for music production. ControlNet enables attaching external controls to a pre-trained generative model by cloning and fine-tuning its encoder on new conditionings. However, this approach incurs a large memory footprint and restricts users to a fixed set of controls. We propose a lightweight, modular architecture that considerably reduces parameter count while matching ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence. Our method offers greater flexibility and significantly lower memory usage, enabling more efficient training and deployment of independent controls. We conduct extensive objective and subjective evaluations and provide numerous audio examples on the accompanying website at https://lightlatentcontrol.github.io

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed, graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified, biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data. SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells). Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI, NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells, suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and next-generation precision medicine.

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations, \textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture. In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion. First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture. We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images, and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance. Code and models are available at https://github.com/LooperXX/ManagerTower.

<title>FIMA-Q: Post-Training Quantization for Vision Transformers by Fisher Information Matrix Approximation</title>

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is available at https://github.com/ShiheWang/FIMA-Q.

Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for protecting quantum information against decoherence. Traditional codes like the surface code require substantial overhead, making them impractical for near-term, early fault-tolerant devices. We propose a novel objective function for tailoring error correction codes to specific noise structures by maximizing the distinguishability between quantum states after a noise channel, ensuring efficient recovery operations. We formalize this concept with the distinguishability loss function, serving as a machine learning objective to discover resource-efficient encoding circuits optimized for given noise characteristics. We implement this methodology using variational techniques, termed variational quantum error correction (VarQEC). Our approach yields codes with desirable theoretical and practical properties and outperforms standard codes in various scenarios. We also provide proof-of-concept demonstrations on IBM and IQM hardware devices, highlighting the practical relevance of our procedure.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of the parameter-shift rule (PSR) for computing gradients in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs). While backpropagation has been fundamental to training conventional neural networks, its implementation in optical neural networks faces significant challenges due to the physical constraints of optical systems. We demonstrate how PSR, which calculates gradients by evaluating functions at shifted parameter values, can be effectively adapted for training UONNs constructed from Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes. The method leverages the inherent Fourier series nature of optical interference in these systems to compute exact analytical gradients directly from hardware measurements. This approach offers a promising alternative to traditional in silico training methods and circumvents the limitations of both finite difference approximations and all-optical backpropagation implementations. We present the theoretical framework and practical methodology for applying PSR to optimize phase parameters in optical neural networks, potentially advancing the development of efficient hardware-based training strategies for optical computing systems.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of outsourced neural network inference presents significant privacy challenges, as sensitive user data is processed on untrusted remote servers. Secure inference offers a privacy-preserving solution, but existing frameworks suffer from high computational overhead and communication costs, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. We introduce SecONNds, a non-intrusive secure inference framework optimized for large ImageNet-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. SecONNds integrates a novel fully Boolean Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol for secure comparison -- addressing Yao's millionaires' problem -- using preprocessed Beaver's bit triples generated from Silent Random Oblivious Transfer. Our novel protocol achieves an online speedup of 17$\times$ in nonlinear operations compared to state-of-the-art solutions while reducing communication overhead. To further enhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) preprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption operations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\times$ on GPU for linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that ensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the results of plaintext computations. Evaluated on a 37-bit quantized SqueezeNet model, SecONNds achieves an end-to-end inference time of 2.8 s on GPU and 3.6 s on CPU, with a total communication of just 420 MiB. SecONNds' efficiency and reduced computational load make it well-suited for deploying privacy-sensitive applications in resource-constrained environments. SecONNds is open source and can be accessed from: https://github.com/shashankballa/SecONNds.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning, lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset and evaluation code.

<title>Evaluating Fairness and Mitigating Bias in Machine Learning: A Novel Technique using Tensor Data and Bayesian Regression</title>

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin color in ML models.

Abstract: State estimation in stochastic dynamical systems with noisy measurements is a challenge. While the Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with independent Gaussian white noise, real-world conditions often deviate from these assumptions, prompting the rise of data-driven filtering techniques. This paper introduces Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed recurrent neural network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive Joseph's formula and optimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood. Experiments with non-Gaussian measurement white noise demonstrate that our model outperforms both the conventional Kalman filter and an existing state-of-the-art deep learning based estimator.

<title>Deep Symmetric Autoencoders from the Eckart-Young-Schmidt Perspective</title>

Abstract: Deep autoencoders have become a fundamental tool in various machine learning applications, ranging from dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of partial differential equations to anomaly detection and neural machine translation. Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance, we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the importance of model design and initialization.

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally, we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical kernel-based methods.

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries. Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the classification in Task 2.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not otherwise accessible. Differential privacy provides a formal framework to mitigate privacy risks by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any single data point does not significantly alter the output of an algorithm, thus limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing development of secure and responsible AI systems.

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$ features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features.

Abstract: Price signals from distribution networks (DNs) guide energy communities (ECs) to adjust energy usage, enabling effective coordination for reliable power system operation. However, this coordination faces significant challenges due to the limited availability of information (i.e., only the aggregated energy usage of ECs is available to DNs), and the high computational burden of accounting for uncertainties and the associated risks through numerous scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum learning and estimation approach to enhance coordination between DNs and ECs. Specifically, leveraging advanced quantum properties such as quantum superposition and entanglement, we develop a hybrid quantum temporal convolutional network-long short-term memory (Q-TCN-LSTM) model to establish an end-to-end mapping between ECs' responses and the price incentives from DNs. Moreover, we develop a quantum estimation method based on quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and two phase-rotation circuits to significantly accelerate the optimization process under numerous uncertainty scenarios. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to classical neural networks, the proposed Q-TCN-LSTM model improves the mapping accuracy by 69.2% while reducing the model size by 99.75% and the computation time by 93.9%. Compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, QAE achieves comparable accuracy with a dramatic reduction in computational time (up to 99.99%) and requires significantly fewer computational resources.

Abstract: Inverse problems are concerned with the reconstruction of unknown physical quantities using indirect measurements and are fundamental across diverse fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and material sciences. These problems serve as critical tools for visualizing internal structures beyond what is visible to the naked eye, enabling quantification, diagnosis, prediction, and discovery. However, most inverse problems are ill-posed, necessitating robust mathematical treatment to yield meaningful solutions. While classical approaches provide mathematically rigorous and computationally stable solutions, they are constrained by the ability to accurately model solution properties and implement them efficiently.
  A more recent paradigm considers deriving solutions to inverse problems in a data-driven manner. Instead of relying on classical mathematical modeling, this approach utilizes highly over-parameterized models, typically deep neural networks, which are adapted to specific inverse problems using carefully selected training data. Current approaches that follow this new paradigm distinguish themselves through solution accuracy paired with computational efficiency that was previously inconceivable.
  These notes offer an introduction to this data-driven paradigm for inverse problems. The first part of these notes will provide an introduction to inverse problems, discuss classical solution strategies, and present some applications. The second part will delve into modern data-driven approaches, with a particular focus on adversarial regularization and provably convergent linear plug-and-play denoisers. Throughout the presentation of these methodologies, their theoretical properties will be discussed, and numerical examples will be provided. The lecture series will conclude with a discussion of open problems and future perspectives in the field.

Abstract: Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also known as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for studying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent language development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich analyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical longform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time, automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant challenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no existing study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However, previous attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in its entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect those utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern ASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a notable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the approach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a median word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13% of the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech without any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also compare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those from manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92 (Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least five times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete step toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of child-centered longform audio.

Abstract: Opinion dynamics models such as the bounded confidence models (BCMs) describe how a population can reach consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, depending on a few parameters. Connecting such models to real-world data could help understanding such phenomena, testing model assumptions. To this end, estimation of model parameters is a key aspect, and maximum likelihood estimation provides a principled way to tackle it. Here, our goal is to outline the properties of statistical estimators of the two key BCM parameters: the confidence bound and the convergence rate. We find that their maximum likelihood estimators present different characteristics: the one for the confidence bound presents a small-sample bias but is consistent, while the estimator of the convergence rate shows a persistent bias. Moreover, the joint parameter estimation is affected by identifiability issues for specific regions of the parameter space, as several local maxima are present in the likelihood function. Our results show how the analysis of the likelihood function is a fruitful approach for better understanding the pitfalls and possibilities of estimating the parameters of opinion dynamics models, and more in general, agent-based models, and for offering formal guarantees for their calibration.

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories, creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network. The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency, representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural dynamics applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance. Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/LongShortAlignment.

<title>CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.

<title>Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organising Systems through Invariant Representations</title>

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component, yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space, leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics. We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex stochastic pattern formation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024 European Parliament and our code are available at https://github.com/dess-mannheim/european_parliament_simulation.

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot, market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average $W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability, supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and wearable ECG applications.

Abstract: The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient, and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent improvements in data quality and classification performance.

<title>Bayesian Optimization with Inexact Acquisition: Is Random Grid Search Sufficient?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used iterative algorithm for optimizing black-box functions. Each iteration requires maximizing an acquisition function, such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) or a sample path from the Gaussian process (GP) posterior, as in Thompson sampling (TS). However, finding an exact solution to these maximization problems is often intractable and computationally expensive. Reflecting such realistic situations, in this paper, we delve into the effect of inexact maximizers of the acquisition functions. Defining a measure of inaccuracy in acquisition solutions, we establish cumulative regret bounds for both GP-UCB and GP-TS without requiring exact solutions of acquisition function maximization. Our results show that under appropriate conditions on accumulated inaccuracy, inexact BO algorithms can still achieve sublinear cumulative regret. Motivated by such findings, we provide both theoretical justification and numerical validation for random grid search as an effective and computationally efficient acquisition function solver.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars. Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches while having a runtime of only a third.

<title>Learning Overspecified Gaussian Mixtures Exponentially Fast with the EM Algorithm</title>

Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of the EM algorithm when applied to overspecified Gaussian mixture models -- that is, when the number of components in the fitted model exceeds that of the true underlying distribution. Focusing on a structured configuration where the component means are positioned at the vertices of a regular simplex and the mixture weights satisfy a non-degeneracy condition, we demonstrate that the population EM algorithm converges exponentially fast in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. Our analysis leverages the strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood function in a neighborhood around the optimum and utilizes the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality to establish that an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation is achievable in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Furthermore, we extend these results to a finite-sample setting by deriving explicit statistical convergence guarantees. Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical findings, highlighting the dramatic acceleration in convergence compared to conventional sublinear rates. This work not only deepens the understanding of EM's behavior in overspecified settings but also offers practical insights into initialization strategies and model design for high-dimensional clustering and density estimation tasks.

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.

<title>Decadal sink-source shifts of forest aboveground carbon since 1988</title>

Abstract: As enduring carbon sinks, forest ecosystems are vital to the terrestrial carbon cycle and help moderate global warming. However, the long-term dynamics of aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain highly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in observations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable, harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high spatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with probabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC and associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time. We find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30 years, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001 and 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the 2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally exhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources after 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in tropical forests over the past three decades. The interannual relationship between global atmospheric CO2 growth rates and tropical AGC flux variability became increasingly negative, reaching Pearson's r = -0.63 (p < 0.05) in the most recent decade. In the Brazilian Amazon, the contribution of deforested regions to AGC losses declined from 60% in 1989-2000 to 13% in 2011-2021, while the share from untouched areas increased from 33% to 76%. Our findings suggest a growing role of tropical forest AGC in modulating variability in the terrestrial carbon cycle, with anthropogenic climate change potentially contributing increasingly to AGC changes, particularly in previously untouched areas.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization that makes use of a "momentum" term; in other words, the stochastic gradient depends not only on the current true gradient of the objective function, but also on the true gradient at the previous iteration. Our formulation includes the Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (SNAG) algorithms as special cases. In addition, in our formulation, the momentum term is allowed to vary as a function of time (i.e., the iteration counter). The assumptions on the stochastic gradient are the most general in the literature, in that it can be biased, and have a conditional variance that grows in an unbounded fashion as a function of time. This last feature is crucial in order to make the theory applicable to "zero-order" methods, where the gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations.
  We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified algorithm. These conditions are natural generalizations of the familiar Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum conditions for standard stochastic gradient descent. We also analyze another method from the literature for the SHB algorithm with a time-varying momentum parameter, and show that it is impracticable.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates (>1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard performance.

Abstract: High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual treatment planning expertise. The objective of this study is to develop a fully automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable treatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints, including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder, rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function. The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients, the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%, outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.

<title>How Visual Representations Map to Language Feature Space in Multimodal LLMs</title>

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models (VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains its original language representations without adaptation to visual data. Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations gradually align with language feature representations, converging in middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation learning.

<title>Learning Before Filtering: Real-Time Hardware Learning at the Detector Level</title>

Abstract: Advances in sensor technology and automation have ushered in an era of data abundance, where the ability to identify and extract relevant information in real time has become increasingly critical. Traditional filtering approaches, which depend on a priori knowledge, often struggle to adapt to dynamic or unanticipated data features. Machine learning offers a compelling alternative-particularly when training can occur directly at or near the detector. This paper presents a digital hardware architecture designed for real-time neural network training, specifically optimized for high-throughput data ingestion. The design is described in an implementation-independent manner, with detailed analysis of each architectural component and their performance implications. Through system parameterization, the study explores trade-offs between processing speed, model complexity, and hardware resource utilization. Practical examples illustrate how these parameters affect applicability across various use cases. A proof-of-concept implementation on an FPGA demonstrates in-situ training, confirming that computational accuracy is preserved relative to conventional software-based approaches. Moreover, resource estimates indicate that current-generation FPGAs can train networks of approximately 3,500 neurons per chip. The architecture is both scalable and adaptable, representing a significant advancement toward integrating learning directly within detector systems and enabling a new class of extreme-edge, real-time information processing.

<title>Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.

Abstract: Computing eigenvalues of very large matrices is a critical task in many machine learning applications, including the evaluation of log-determinants, the trace of matrix functions, and other important metrics. As datasets continue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices become increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct formation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on matrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the matrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning, or when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can be restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these cases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit operator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In such settings, the matrix is "impalpable," in the sense that we have access to only masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory to introduce a novel method of "free decompression" to estimate the spectrum of such matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical spectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely large (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full matrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting distributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as applying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their full empirical eigenspectra.

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has attracted considerable attention for its effectiveness in improving generalization in deep neural network training by explicitly minimizing sharpness in the loss landscape. Its success, however, relies on the assumption that there exists sufficient variability of flatness in the solution space-a condition commonly facilitated by overparameterization. Yet, the interaction between SAM and overparameterization has not been thoroughly investigated, leaving a gap in understanding precisely how overparameterization affects SAM. Thus, in this work, we analyze SAM under varying degrees of overparameterization, presenting both empirical and theoretical findings that reveal its critical influence on SAM's effectiveness. First, we conduct extensive numerical experiments across diverse domains, demonstrating that SAM consistently benefits from overparameterization. Next, we attribute this phenomenon to the interplay between the enlarged solution space and increased implicit bias resulting from overparameterization. Furthermore, we show that this effect is particularly pronounced in practical settings involving label noise and sparsity, and yet, sufficient regularization is necessary. Last but not least, we provide other theoretical insights into how overparameterization helps SAM achieve minima with more uniform Hessian moments compared to SGD, and much faster convergence at a linear rate.

Abstract: Feature Visualization (FV) is a widely used technique for interpreting the concepts learned by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which synthesizes input patterns that maximally activate a given feature. Despite its popularity, the trustworthiness of FV explanations has received limited attention. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, Gradient Slingshots, that enables manipulation of FV without modifying the model architecture or significantly degrading its performance. By shaping new trajectories in the off-distribution regions of the activation landscape of a feature, we coerce the optimization process to converge in a predefined visualization. We evaluate our approach on several DNN architectures, demonstrating its ability to replace faithfuls FV with arbitrary targets. These results expose a critical vulnerability: auditors relying solely on FV may accept entirely fabricated explanations. To mitigate this risk, we propose a straightforward defense and quantitatively demonstrate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a family of probabilistic generative models that learn to sample compositional objects proportional to their rewards. One big challenge of GFlowNets is training them effectively when dealing with long time horizons and sparse rewards. To address this, we propose Evolution guided generative flow networks (EGFN), a simple but powerful augmentation to the GFlowNets training using Evolutionary algorithms (EA). Our method can work on top of any GFlowNets training objective, by training a set of agent parameters using EA, storing the resulting trajectories in the prioritized replay buffer, and training the GFlowNets agent using the stored trajectories. We present a thorough investigation over a wide range of toy and real-world benchmark tasks showing the effectiveness of our method in handling long trajectories and sparse rewards. We release the code at http://github.com/zarifikram/egfn.

Abstract: This paper introduces DiffTORI, which utilizes Differentiable Trajectory Optimization as the policy representation to generate actions for deep Reinforcement and Imitation learning. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/wkwan7/DiffTORI.

Abstract: A dataset is confounded if it is most easily solved via a spurious correlation, which fails to generalize to new data. In this work, we show that, in a continual learning setting where confounders may vary in time across tasks, the challenge of mitigating the effect of confounders far exceeds the standard forgetting problem normally considered. In particular, we provide a formal description of such continual confounders and identify that, in general, spurious correlations are easily ignored when training for all tasks jointly, but it is harder to avoid confounding when they are considered sequentially. These descriptions serve as a basis for constructing a novel CLEVR-based continually confounded dataset, which we term the ConCon dataset. Our evaluations demonstrate that standard continual learning methods fail to ignore the dataset's confounders. Overall, our work highlights the challenges of confounding factors, particularly in continual learning settings, and demonstrates the need for developing continual learning methods to robustly tackle these.

Abstract: Deep time series models often suffer from reliability issues due to their tendency to rely on spurious correlations, leading to incorrect predictions. To mitigate such shortcuts and prevent "Clever-Hans" moments in time series models, we introduce Right on Time (RioT), a novel method that enables interacting with model explanations across both the time and frequency domains. By incorporating feedback on explanations in both domains, RioT constrains the model, steering it away from annotated spurious correlations. This dual-domain interaction strategy is crucial for effectively addressing shortcuts in time series datasets. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of RioT in guiding models toward more reliable decision-making across popular time series classification and forecasting datasets, as well as our newly recorded dataset with naturally occuring shortcuts, P2S, collected from a real mechanical production line.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for differentially private model training are based on matrix factorization techniques. However, these methods suffer from high computational overhead because they require numerically solving a demanding optimization problem to determine an approximately optimal factorization prior to the actual model training. In this work, we present a new matrix factorization approach, BSR, which overcomes this computational bottleneck. By exploiting properties of the standard matrix square root, BSR allows to efficiently handle also large-scale problems. For the key scenario of stochastic gradient descent with momentum and weight decay, we even derive analytical expressions for BSR that render the computational overhead negligible. We prove bounds on the approximation quality that hold both in the centralized and in the federated learning setting. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that models trained using BSR perform on par with the best existing methods, while completely avoiding their computational overhead.

Abstract: Robustness with respect to weight perturbations underpins guarantees for generalization, pruning and quantization. Existing guarantees rely on Lipschitz bounds in parameter space, cover only plain feed-forward MLPs, and break under the ubiquitous neuron-wise rescaling symmetry of ReLU networks. We prove a new Lipschitz inequality expressed through the $\ell^1$-path-metric of the weights. The bound is (i) rescaling-invariant by construction and (ii) applies to any ReLU-DAG architecture with any combination of convolutions, skip connections, pooling, and frozen (inference-time) batch-normalization -- thus encompassing ResNets, U-Nets, VGG-style CNNs, and more. By respecting the network's natural symmetries, the new bound strictly sharpens prior parameter-space bounds and can be computed in two forward passes. To illustrate its utility, we derive from it a symmetry-aware pruning criterion and show -- through a proof-of-concept experiment on a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNet -- that its pruning performance matches that of classical magnitude pruning, while becoming totally immune to arbitrary neuron-wise rescalings.

Abstract: Kronecker-sparse (KS) matrices -- whose supports are Kronecker products of identity and all-ones blocks -- underpin the structure of Butterfly and Monarch matrices and offer the promise of more efficient models. However, existing GPU kernels for KS matrix multiplication suffer from high data movement costs, with up to 50% of time spent on memory-bound tensor permutations. We propose a fused, output-stationary GPU kernel that eliminates these overheads, reducing global memory traffic threefold. Across 600 KS patterns, our kernel achieves in FP32 a median speedup of x1.4 and lowers energy consumption by 15%. A simple heuristic based on KS pattern parameters predicts when our method outperforms existing ones. We release all code at github.com/PascalCarrivain/ksmm, including a PyTorch-compatible KSLinear layer, and demonstrate in FP32 end-to-end latency reductions of up to 22% in ViT-S/16 and 16% in GPT-2 medium.

Abstract: The representation of feature space is a crucial environment where data points get vectorized and embedded for subsequent modeling. Thus the efficacy of machine learning (ML) algorithms is closely related to the quality of feature engineering. As one of the most important techniques, feature generation transforms raw data into an optimized feature space conducive to model training and further refines the space. Despite the advancements in automated feature engineering and feature generation, current methodologies often suffer from three fundamental issues: lack of explainability, limited applicability, and inflexible strategy. These shortcomings frequently hinder and limit the deployment of ML models across varied scenarios. Our research introduces a novel approach adopting large language models (LLMs) and feature-generating prompts to address these challenges. We propose a dynamic and adaptive feature generation method that enhances the interpretability of the feature generation process. Our approach broadens the applicability across various data types and tasks and offers advantages over strategic flexibility. A broad range of experiments showcases that our approach is significantly superior to existing methods.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuro-developmental challenge, presenting a spectrum of difficulties in social interaction, communication, and the expression of repetitive behaviors in different situations. This increasing prevalence underscores the importance of ASD as a major public health concern and the need for comprehensive research initiatives to advance our understanding of the disorder and its early detection methods. This study introduces a novel hierarchical feature fusion method aimed at enhancing the early detection of ASD in children through the analysis of code-switched speech (English and Hindi). Employing advanced audio processing techniques, the research integrates acoustic, paralinguistic, and linguistic information using Transformer Encoders. This innovative fusion strategy is designed to improve classification robustness and accuracy, crucial for early and precise ASD identification. The methodology involves collecting a code-switched speech corpus, CoSAm, from children diagnosed with ASD and a matched control group. The dataset comprises 61 voice recordings from 30 children diagnosed with ASD and 31 from neurotypical children, aged between 3 and 13 years, resulting in a total of 159.75 minutes of voice recordings. The feature analysis focuses on MFCCs and extensive statistical attributes to capture speech pattern variability and complexity. The best model performance is achieved using a hierarchical fusion technique with an accuracy of 98.75% using a combination of acoustic and linguistic features first, followed by paralinguistic features in a hierarchical manner.

Abstract: In the context of over-parameterization, there is a line of work demonstrating that randomly initialized (stochastic) gradient descent (GD) converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic loss function. However, the learning rate of GD for training two-layer neural networks exhibits poor dependence on the sample size and the Gram matrix, leading to a slow training process. In this paper, we show that for training two-layer $\text{ReLU}^3$ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), the learning rate can be improved from $\mathcal{O}(\lambda_0)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1/\|\bm{H}^{\infty}\|_2)$, implying that GD actually enjoys a faster convergence rate. Despite such improvements, the convergence rate is still tied to the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix, leading to slow convergence. We then develop the positive definiteness of Gram matrices with general smooth activation functions and provide the convergence analysis of natural gradient descent (NGD) in training two-layer PINNs, demonstrating that the learning rate can be $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and at this rate, the convergence rate is independent of the Gram matrix. In particular, for smooth activation functions, the convergence rate of NGD is quadratic. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify our theoretical results.

Abstract: Single-operator learning involves training a deep neural network to learn a specific operator, whereas recent work in multi-operator learning uses an operator embedding structure to train a single neural network on data from multiple operators. Thus, multi-operator learning is capable of predicting a range of operators within one model. In this work, we propose pretraining and fine-tuning strategies for solving PDEs using multi-operator learning. One key aspect is that by increasing the number of families of operators used in pretraining, a PDE foundation model can be fine-tuned to downstream tasks involving new PDEs with a limited number of samples, thus outperforming single operator neural networks. Specifically, a multi-operator learning model pre-trained with data from diverse PDE families can predict unseen operators after fine-tuning with only a limited number of operators from the new family, enabling them to serve as a data-free PDE solver. We also show that the proposed training and fine-tuning method is able to predict new operators in zero-shot prediction without samples. Additionally, we introduce a PDE-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to improve the adaptability of the model to various PDEs by providing a better parameter initialization process. To address the needs of applications with limited computing resources, we explore low-rank adaptation methods that reduce computational costs while enhancing solver accuracy. Lastly, by examining the scaling law with respect to the number of operator families, we establish and highlight its potential for broad adaptation in PDE-solving tasks.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is a collaborative machine learning framework for training a model across participants without a central server or raw data exchange. DFL faces challenges due to statistical heterogeneity, as participants often possess data of different distributions reflecting local environments and user behaviors. Recent work has shown that the neural tangent kernel (NTK) approach, when applied to federated learning in a centralized framework, can lead to improved performance. We propose an approach leveraging the NTK to train client models in the decentralized setting, while introducing a synergy between NTK-based evolution and model averaging. This synergy exploits inter-client model deviation and improves both accuracy and convergence in heterogeneous settings. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves higher accuracy than baselines in highly heterogeneous settings, where other approaches often underperform. Additionally, it reaches target performance in 4.6 times fewer communication rounds. We validate our approach across multiple datasets, network topologies, and heterogeneity settings to ensure robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning framework that enables multiple nodes to train models on their local data and periodically average weight updates to benefit from other nodes' training. Each node's goal is to collaborate with other nodes to improve the model's performance while keeping its training data private. However, this framework does not guarantee data privacy. Prior work has shown that the gradient-sharing steps in FL can be vulnerable to data reconstruction attacks from an honest-but-curious central server. In this work, we show that an honest-but-curious node/client can also launch attacks to reconstruct peers' image data through gradient inversion, presenting a severe privacy risk. We demonstrate that a single client can silently reconstruct other clients' private images using diluted information available within consecutive updates. We leverage state-of-the-art diffusion models to enhance the perceptual quality and recognizability of the reconstructed images, further demonstrating the risk of information leakage at a semantic level. This highlights the need for more robust privacy-preserving mechanisms that protect against silent client-side attacks during federated training.

Abstract: The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to particular domains. This has enabled the creation of powerful and adaptive routing-based "Model MoErging" methods with the goal of using expert modules to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization. However, existing MoErging methods often prioritize generalization to unseen tasks at the expense of performance on held-in tasks, which limits its practical applicability in real-world deployment scenarios. We observe that current token-level routing mechanisms neglect the global semantic context of the input task. This token-wise independence hinders effective expert selection for held-in tasks, as routing decisions fail to incorporate the semantic properties of the task. To address this, we propose, Global and Local Instruction Driven Expert Router (GLIDER) that integrates a multi-scale routing mechanism, encompassing a semantic global router and a learned local router. The global router leverages LLM's advanced reasoning capabilities for semantic-related contexts to enhance expert selection. Given the input query and LLM, the router generates semantic task instructions that guide the retrieval of the most relevant experts across all layers. This global guidance is complemented by a local router that facilitates token-level routing decisions within each module, enabling finer control and enhanced performance on unseen tasks. Our experiments using T5-based models for T0 and FLAN tasks demonstrate that GLIDER achieves substantially improved held-in performance while maintaining strong generalization on held-out tasks. We also perform ablations experiments to dive deeper into the components of GLIDER. Our experiments highlight the importance of our multi-scale routing that leverages LLM-driven semantic reasoning for MoErging methods.

Abstract: Adapting to latent-confounded shifts remains a core challenge in modern AI. These shifts are propagated via latent variables that induce spurious, non-transportable correlations between inputs and labels. One practical failure mode arises when fine-tuning pre-trained foundation models on confounded data (e.g., where certain text tokens or image backgrounds spuriously correlate with the label), leaving models vulnerable at deployment. We frame causal fine-tuning as an identification problem and pose an explicit causal model that decomposes inputs into low-level spurious features and high-level causal representations. Under this family of models, we formalize the assumptions required for identification. Using pre-trained language models as a case study, we show how identifying and adjusting these components during causal fine-tuning enables automatic adaptation to latent-confounded shifts at test time. Experiments on semi-synthetic benchmarks derived from real-world problems demonstrate that our method outperforms black-box domain generalization baselines, illustrating the benefits of explicitly modeling causal structure.

Abstract: As post-training processes utilize increasingly large datasets and base models continue to grow in size, the computational demands and implementation challenges of existing algorithms are escalating significantly. In this paper, we propose modeling the changes at the logits level during post-training using a separate neural network (i.e., the value network). After training this network on a small base model using demonstrations, this network can be seamlessly integrated with other pre-trained models during inference, enables them to achieve similar capability enhancements. We systematically investigate the best practices for this paradigm in terms of pre-training weights and connection schemes. We demonstrate that the resulting value network has broad transferability across pre-trained models of different parameter sizes within the same family, models undergoing continuous pre-training within the same family, and models with different vocabularies across families. In certain cases, it can achieve performance comparable to full-parameter fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore methods to enhance the transferability of the value model and prevent overfitting to the base model used during training.

Abstract: In this work, we explore modeling change points in time-series data using neural stochastic differential equations (neural SDEs). We propose a novel model formulation and training procedure based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for modeling time-series as a neural SDE. Unlike existing algorithms training neural SDEs as VAEs, our proposed algorithm only necessitates a Gaussian prior of the initial state of the latent stochastic process, rather than a Wiener process prior on the entire latent stochastic process. We develop two methodologies for modeling and estimating change points in time-series data with distribution shifts. Our iterative algorithm alternates between updating neural SDE parameters and updating the change points based on either a maximum likelihood-based approach or a change point detection algorithm using the sequential likelihood ratio test. We provide a theoretical analysis of this proposed change point detection scheme. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the expressive power of our proposed model, showing that it can effectively model both classical parametric SDEs and some real datasets with distribution shifts.

Abstract: Generalization outside the scope of one's training data requires leveraging prior knowledge about the effects that transfer, and the effects that don't, between different data sources. Transfer learning is a framework for specifying and refining this knowledge about sets of source (training) and target (prediction) data. A challenging open problem is addressing the empirical phenomenon of negative transfer, whereby the transfer learner performs worse on the target data after taking the source data into account than before. We first introduce a Bayesian perspective on negative transfer, and then a method to address it. The key insight from our formulation is that negative transfer can stem from misspecified prior information about non-transferable causes of the source data. Our proposed method, proxy-informed robust method for probabilistic transfer learning (PROMPT), does not require prior knowledge of the source data (the data sources may be "unknown"). PROMPT is thus applicable when differences between tasks are unobserved, such as in the presence of latent confounders. Moreover, the learner need not have access to observations in the target task (may not have the ability to "fine-tune"), and instead makes use of proxy (indirect) information. Our theoretical results show that the threat of negative transfer does not depend on the informativeness of the proxy information, highlighting the usefulness of PROMPT in cases where only noisy indirect information, such as human feedback, is available.

Abstract: In the post-training of large language models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach to achieve generation aligned with human preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allows for policy training with a simple binary cross-entropy loss without a reward model. The objective of DPO is regularized by reverse KL divergence that encourages mode-seeking fitting to the reference policy. Nonetheless, we indicate that minimizing reverse KL divergence could fail to capture a mode of the reference distribution, which may hurt the policy's performance. Based on this observation, we propose a simple modification to DPO, H-DPO, which allows for control over the entropy of the resulting policy, enhancing the distribution's sharpness and thereby enabling mode-seeking fitting more effectively. In our experiments, we show that H-DPO outperformed DPO across various tasks, demonstrating superior results in pass@$k$ evaluations for mathematical tasks. Moreover, H-DPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor modifications to the loss calculation of DPO, which makes it highly practical and promising for wide-ranging applications in the training of LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal models are trained on large-scale web-crawled datasets, which often contain noise, bias, and irrelevant information. This motivates the use of data selection techniques, which can be divided into model-free variants, relying on heuristic rules and downstream datasets, and model-based approaches, such as those using influence functions. The former can be expensive to design and risks introducing unwanted dataset dependencies, while the latter are often computationally prohibitive. In this work, we propose an efficient, model-based approach using the Mimic Score, a new data-quality metric that leverages the weights of a reference model to assess the usefulness of individual samples for training a new model. Our method relies on measuring alignments between training gradients and a target direction induced by this reference model. Building on the derived mimic scores, we develop Grad-Mimic: a framework that prioritizes samples to learn, estimates overall sample utility, and creates effective filters. Empirically, using mimic scores to guide training improves data efficiency, accelerates convergence, yields consistent performance gains across six image datasets, and enhances CLIP models with 20.7% fewer training steps. Moreover, mimic score-based filters complement existing filtering methods, e.g., training improved CLIP models with 4.7 million fewer samples while offering accurate estimation of dataset quality.

<title>Physics-Informed Latent Neural Operator for Real-time Predictions of Complex Physical Systems</title>

Abstract: Deep operator network (DeepONet) has shown significant promise as surrogate models for systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling accurate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. However, for complex, high-dimensional systems, these models often require heavily overparameterized networks, leading to long training times and convergence difficulties. Latent DeepONet addresses some of these challenges by introducing a two-step approach: first learning a reduced latent space using a separate model, followed by operator learning within this latent space. While efficient, this method is inherently data-driven and lacks mechanisms for incorporating physical laws, limiting its robustness and generalizability in data-scarce settings. In this work, we propose PI-Latent-NO, a physics-informed latent neural operator framework that integrates governing physics directly into the learning process. Our architecture features two coupled DeepONets trained end-to-end: a Latent-DeepONet that learns a low-dimensional representation of the solution, and a Reconstruction-DeepONet that maps this latent representation back to the physical space. By embedding PDE constraints into the training via automatic differentiation, our method eliminates the need for labeled training data and ensures physics-consistent predictions. The proposed framework is both memory and compute-efficient, exhibiting near-constant scaling with problem size and demonstrating significant speedups over traditional physics-informed operator models. We validate our approach on a range of high-dimensional parametric PDEs, showcasing its accuracy, scalability, and suitability for real-time prediction in complex physical systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches mainly rely on imitation learning and struggle to achieve effective test-time scaling. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for enabling self-exploration, recent attempts yield modest improvements in complex reasoning. In this paper, we present T1 to scale RL by encouraging exploration and understand inference scaling. We first initialize the LLM using synthesized chain-of-thought data that integrates trial-and-error and self-verification. To scale RL training, we promote increased sampling diversity through oversampling. We demonstrate that T1 with open LLMs as its base exhibits inference scaling behavior and achieves superior performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. More importantly, we present a simple strategy to examine inference scaling, where increased inference budgets directly lead to T1's better performance without any additional verification.

Abstract: Variational data assimilation estimates the dynamical system states by minimizing a cost function that fits the numerical models with the observational data. Although four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) is widely used, it faces high computational costs in complex nonlinear systems and depends on imperfect state-observation mappings. Deep learning (DL) offers more expressive approximators, while integrating DL models into 4D-Var is challenging due to their nonlinearities and lack of theoretical guarantees in assimilation results. In this paper, we propose Tensor-Var, a novel framework that integrates kernel conditional mean embedding (CME) with 4D-Var to linearize nonlinear dynamics, achieving convex optimization in a learned feature space. Moreover, our method provides a new perspective for solving 4D-Var in a linear way, offering theoretical guarantees of consistent assimilation results between the original and feature spaces. To handle large-scale problems, we propose a method to learn deep features using neural networks within the Tensor-Var framework. Experiments on chaotic systems and global weather prediction with real-time observations show that Tensor-Var outperforms conventional and DL hybrid 4D-Var baselines in accuracy while achieving a 10- to 20-fold speed improvement.

Abstract: Humans excel in analogical learning and knowledge transfer and, more importantly, possess a unique understanding of identifying appropriate sources of knowledge. From a model's perspective, this presents an interesting challenge. If models could autonomously retrieve knowledge useful for transfer or decision-making to solve problems, they would transition from passively acquiring to actively accessing and learning from knowledge. However, filling models with knowledge is relatively straightforward -- it simply requires more training and accessible knowledge bases. The more complex task is teaching models about which knowledge can be analogized and transferred. Therefore, we design a knowledge augmentation method, LEKA, for knowledge transfer that actively searches for suitable knowledge sources that can enrich the target domain's knowledge. This LEKA method extracts key information from the target domain's textual information, retrieves pertinent data from external data libraries, and harmonizes retrieved data with the target domain data in feature space and marginal probability measures. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across various domains and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods in reducing computational costs, automating data alignment, and optimizing transfer learning outcomes.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a flexible framework for parameterizing probability distributions using neural networks. However, learning EBMs by exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is generally intractable, due to the need to compute the partition function (normalization constant). In this paper, we propose a novel formulation for approximately learning probabilistic EBMs in combinatorially-large discrete spaces, such as sets or permutations. Our key idea is to jointly learn both an energy model and its log-partition, both parameterized as a neural network. Our approach not only provides a novel tractable objective criterion to learn EBMs by stochastic gradient descent (without relying on MCMC), but also a novel means to estimate the log-partition function on unseen data points. On the theoretical side, we show that our approach recovers the optimal MLE solution when optimizing in the space of continuous functions. Furthermore, we show that our approach naturally extends to the broader family of Fenchel-Young losses, allowing us to obtain the first tractable method for optimizing the sparsemax loss in combinatorially-large spaces. We demonstrate our approach on multilabel classification and label ranking.

Abstract: The logistic loss (a.k.a. cross-entropy loss) is one of the most popular loss functions used for multiclass classification. It is also the loss function of choice for next-token prediction in language modeling. It is associated with the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence and the softargmax operator. In this work, we propose to construct new convex loss functions based on $f$-divergences. Our loss functions generalize the logistic loss in two directions: i) by replacing the KL divergence with $f$-divergences and ii) by allowing non-uniform reference measures. We instantiate our framework for numerous $f$-divergences, recovering existing losses and creating new ones. By analogy with the logistic loss, the loss function generated by an $f$-divergence is associated with an operator, that we dub $f$-softargmax. We derive a novel parallelizable bisection algorithm for computing the $f$-softargmax associated with any $f$-divergence. On the empirical side, one of the goals of this paper is to determine the effectiveness of loss functions beyond the classical cross-entropy in a language model setting, including on pre-training, post-training (SFT) and distillation. We show that the loss function generated by the $\alpha$-divergence (which is equivalent to Tsallis $\alpha$-negentropy in the case of unit reference measures) with $\alpha=1.5$ performs well across several tasks.

Abstract: With the rise in global greenhouse gas emissions, accurate large-scale tree canopy height maps are essential for understanding forest structure, estimating above-ground biomass, and monitoring ecological disruptions. To this end, we present a novel approach to generate large-scale, high-resolution canopy height maps over time. Our model accurately predicts canopy height over multiple years given Sentinel-1 composite and Sentinel~2 time series satellite data. Using GEDI LiDAR data as the ground truth for training the model, we present the first 10m resolution temporal canopy height map of the European continent for the period 2019-2022. As part of this product, we also offer a detailed canopy height map for 2020, providing more precise estimates than previous studies. Our pipeline and the resulting temporal height map are publicly available, enabling comprehensive large-scale monitoring of forests and, hence, facilitating future research and ecological analyses.

Abstract: Pruning encompasses a range of techniques aimed at increasing the sparsity of neural networks (NNs). These techniques can generally be framed as minimizing a loss function subject to an $L_0$ norm constraint. This paper introduces CoNNect, a novel differentiable regularizer for sparse NN training that ensures connectivity between input and output layers. We prove that CoNNect approximates $L_0$ regularization, guaranteeing maximally connected network structures while avoiding issues like layer collapse. Moreover, CoNNect is easily integrated with established structural pruning strategies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that CoNNect can improve classical pruning strategies and enhance state-of-the-art one-shot pruners, such as DepGraph and LLM-pruner.

Abstract: As data continues to grow in volume and complexity across domains such as finance, manufacturing, and healthcare, effective anomaly detection is essential for identifying irregular patterns that may signal critical issues. Recently, foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for advancing anomaly detection. They have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in enhancing anomaly identification, generating detailed data descriptions, and providing visual explanations. This survey presents the first comprehensive review of recent advancements in FM-based anomaly detection. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies FMs into three categories based on their roles in anomaly detection tasks, i.e., as encoders, detectors, or interpreters. We provide a systematic analysis of state-of-the-art methods and discuss key challenges in leveraging FMs for improved anomaly detection. We also outline future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics. Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching the 100 millions, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce AB-UPT as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for CFD simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a novel divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a CAD geometry alone, omitting the need for costly CFD meshing procedures.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained attention for its capacity to integrate information from different modalities. However, it is often hindered by the multimodal imbalance problem, where certain modality dominates while others remain underutilized. Although recent studies have proposed various methods to alleviate this problem, they lack comprehensive and fair comparisons. In this paper, we systematically categorize various mainstream multimodal imbalance algorithms into four groups based on the strategies they employ to mitigate imbalance. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, we introduce BalanceBenchmark, a benchmark including multiple widely used multidimensional datasets and evaluation metrics from three perspectives: performance, imbalance degree, and complexity. To ensure fair comparisons, we have developed a modular and extensible toolkit that standardizes the experimental workflow across different methods. Based on the experiments using BalanceBenchmark, we have identified several key insights into the characteristics and advantages of different method groups in terms of performance, balance degree and computational complexity. We expect such analysis could inspire more efficient approaches to address the imbalance problem in the future, as well as foundation models. The code of the toolkit is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/BalanceBenchmark.

Abstract: In recent years, mixup regularization has gained popularity as an effective way to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models by training on convex combinations of training data. While many mixup variants have been explored, the proper adoption of the technique to conditional density estimation and probabilistic machine learning remains relatively unexplored. This work introduces a novel framework for mixup regularization based on probabilistic fusion that is better suited for conditional density estimation tasks. For data distributed according to a member of the exponential family, we show that likelihood functions can be analytically fused using log-linear pooling. We further propose an extension of probabilistic mixup, which allows for fusion of inputs at an arbitrary intermediate layer of the neural network. We provide a theoretical analysis comparing our approach to standard mixup variants. Empirical results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the benefits of our proposed framework compared to existing mixup variants.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning is fundamentally about transforming incomparable modalities into comparable representations. While prior research primarily focused on explicitly aligning these representations through targeted learning objectives and model architectures, a recent line of work has found that independently trained unimodal models of increasing scale and performance can become implicitly aligned with each other. These findings raise fundamental questions regarding the emergence of aligned representations in multimodal learning. Specifically: (1) when and why does alignment emerge implicitly? and (2) is alignment a reliable indicator of performance? Through a comprehensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that both the emergence of alignment and its relationship with task performance depend on several critical data characteristics. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the degree of similarity between the modalities and the balance between redundant and unique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest that alignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance varies depending on the dataset and task. These insights can help practitioners determine whether increasing alignment between modalities is advantageous or, in some cases, detrimental to achieving optimal performance.

Abstract: Transformers consist of diverse building blocks, such as embedding layers, normalization layers, self-attention mechanisms, and point-wise feedforward networks. Thus, understanding the differences and interactions among these blocks is important. In this paper, we uncover a clear Sharpness Disparity across these blocks, which emerges early in training and intriguingly persists throughout the training process. Motivated by this finding, we propose Blockwise Learning Rate (LR), a strategy that tailors the LR to each block's sharpness, accelerating large language model (LLM) pre-training. By integrating Blockwise LR into AdamW, we consistently achieve lower terminal loss and nearly $2\times$ speedup compared to vanilla AdamW. We demonstrate this acceleration across GPT-2 and LLaMA, with model sizes ranging from 0.12B to 2B and datasets of OpenWebText, MiniPile, and C4. Finally, we incorporate Blockwise LR into Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024), a recently proposed memory-efficient variant of Adam, achieving a combined $2\times$ speedup and $2\times$ memory saving. These results underscore the potential of exploiting the sharpness disparity to improve LLM training.

<title>V-Max: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets.

<title>Accelerating Transient CFD through Machine Learning-Based Flow Initialization</title>

Abstract: Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential for many industrial applications, but suffer from high compute costs relative to steady-state simulations. This is due to the need to: (a) reach statistical steadiness by physically advecting errors in the initial field sufficiently far downstream, and (b) gather a sufficient sample of fluctuating flow data to estimate time-averaged quantities of interest. We present a machine learning-based initialization method that aims to reduce the cost of transient solve by providing more accurate initial fields. Through a case study in automotive aerodynamics on a 17M-cell unsteady incompressible RANS simulation, we evaluate three proposed ML-based initialization strategies against existing methods. Here, we demonstrate 50% reductions in time-to-convergence compared to traditional uniform and potential flow-based initializations. Two ML-based initialization strategies are recommended for general use: (1) a hybrid method combining ML predictions with potential flow solutions, and (2) an approach integrating ML predictions with uniform flow. Both strategies enable CFD solvers to achieve convergence times comparable to computationally-expensive steady RANS initializations, while requiring far less wall-clock time to compute the initialization field. Notably, these improvements are achieved using an ML model trained on a different dataset of diverse automotive geometries, demonstrating generalization capabilities relevant to specific industrial application areas. Because this Hybrid-ML workflow only modifies the inputs to an existing CFD solver, rather than modifying the solver itself, it can be applied to existing CFD workflows with relatively minimal changes; this provides a practical approach to accelerating industrial CFD simulations using existing ML surrogate models.

<title>Kernel Logistic Regression Learning for High-Capacity Hopfield Networks</title>

Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network storage capacity (pattern-to-neuron ratio around 0.14). We propose Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) learning. Unlike linear methods, KLR uses kernels to implicitly map patterns to high-dimensional feature space, enhancing separability. By learning dual variables, KLR dramatically improves storage capacity, achieving perfect recall even when pattern numbers exceed neuron numbers (up to ratio 1.5 shown), and enhances noise robustness. KLR demonstrably outperforms Hebbian and linear logistic regression approaches.

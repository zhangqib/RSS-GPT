<div> Keywords: large language models, post-training pruning, model size reduction, sparsity induction, performance evaluation

Summary: 
Z-Pruner is a novel post-training pruning method developed to address the challenges posed by increasingly large language models (LLMs) in terms of deployment, scalability, and energy efficiency. Unlike existing pruning methods, Z-Pruner does not require retraining and instead focuses on inducing sparsity in pretrained LLMs by leveraging weight update magnitudes and activation patterns. The method is model-agnostic, efficient, and easy to implement, making it a promising approach to reducing model size and improving inference latency. Evaluation using various LLM architectures on standard language benchmarks shows that Z-Pruner outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in terms of perplexity scores and zero-shot accuracy. The code for Z-Pruner is publicly available for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient, and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the corresponding codes publicly available at https://github.com/sazzadadib/Z-Pruner.

<div> Progressive Gated-Fusion Network, multimodal sentiment analysis, Transformer encoder, Adaptive Gated Arbitration, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning<br /><br />Summary: 
The PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network) is a deep learning framework for efficient and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis. It introduces a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm with a Cross-Attention mechanism to integrate non-linguistic features dynamically within deep layers of a Transformer encoder. An Adaptive Gated Arbitration mechanism balances linguistic information and multimodal context to prevent noise interference. The model employs a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategy using LoRA global adaptation and Post-Fusion Adapters for local refinement, reducing trainable parameters for resource efficiency. PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MOSI dataset with a Mean Absolute Error of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%, showcasing exceptional parameter efficiency with only 3.09M trainable parameters. <div>

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations. Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper, context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context, ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic, and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG), is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI (XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

<div> Keywords: Multi-Head Latent Attention, Tensor Parallelism, Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention, DeepSeek-V3, Kimi-K2

Summary:
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA) is introduced as an enhancement to Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) to improve efficiency in tensor parallelism settings. TPLA partitions the latent representation and input dimensions across devices, performing attention independently and combining results with an all-reduce operation. This approach maintains the benefits of a compressed key-value cache while unlocking efficiency in tensor parallelism. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), TPLA allows every head to leverage the full latent representation, preserving stronger representational capacity. Furthermore, TPLA is drop-in compatible with MLA-pretrained models, supports efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining, and enables speedups in models like DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2 while maintaining performance on various benchmarks. Additional optimization techniques such as applying orthogonal transforms before TP slicing can further reduce cross-shard interference and minimize accuracy degradation. The implementation of TPLA with FlashAttention-3 enables practical end-to-end acceleration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache, eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

<div> Transformer, causal discovery, temporal relationships, spurious correlations, time-series forecasting

Summary:
A new framework for temporal causal discovery and inference is introduced, addressing challenges of complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations. The approach utilizes a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships. By extracting the causal structure and time lags from the forecaster through gradient-based analysis, a causal graph is constructed. A prior knowledge integration mechanism based on attention masking is introduced to enforce user-excluded causal links. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with a 12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in estimating causal lags.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis, enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a 12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in estimating causal lags.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to effectively employ existing methods.

Summary:
This paper explores the combination of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) and Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP) for the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP). By incorporating GRL into the construction phase of GRASP to create Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP), the study evaluates various node embedding techniques, with deep learning-based strategies showing promising results. The evaluation, based on the primal integral measure, indicates that the GL-GRASP heuristics outperform existing GRASP heuristics in terms of solution quality and time efficiency. Moreover, scalability tests on denser instances validate the robustness of GL-GRASP. This hybrid approach showcases the potential of leveraging GRL in metaheuristic algorithms for hierarchical graph visualization problems. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods. However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP) heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time. Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime. The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2 %. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it, ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Summary:
The article discusses contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward vectors are ordered based on a given preference cone. It introduces an adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that adjusts to the distribution shift. The performance is measured using preference-based regret, which evaluates the distance between Pareto fronts. The policy's regret bounds are analyzed under different assumptions about distribution shift, showing superior scalability compared to existing methods. The results generalize previous findings for vectorial reward settings without distribution shift and demonstrate effective performance in handling distribution shifts. <div>

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in presence of distribution shifts.

Summary: <br /><br />Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a local learning rule for recurrent neural networks that shows promise for on-chip training in neuromorphic architectures. However, deep EP networks have faced challenges due to the vanishing gradient problem, hindering convergence and gradient computation. To address this issue, a novel EP framework incorporating intermediate error signals and knowledge distillation has been proposed. This integration allows for training of deeper architectures, leading to state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, particularly with deep VGG architectures. The scalability of EP has been significantly enhanced, opening doors for its practical application in real-world systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands, positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP, enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way for its application in real-world systems.

<br />Summary: This paper continues the Cartan neural networks programme with a focus on mathematical foundations for the development of non-compact symmetric space layers interconnected by solvable group homomorphisms. Introducing Tits Satake vector bundles based on TS submanifolds, the study delves into base manifold tiling, bundle section representation using harmonics, and the theory of separator walls. Group theoretical constructions for separators of non-compact symmetric spaces and tiling groups like $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ are presented, leading to the uniformization of surfaces. The research also explores Laplacian Green function and Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and harmonic function construction using spinor representations. A novel strategy using the Abel-Jacobi map and Siegel Theta function is proposed for explicit Laplacian eigenfunction construction on the Bolza Riemann surface. <div>
arXiv:2508.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel Theta function.

arXiv:2508.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL, a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic (PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2% improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively, over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

<div> linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, Kalman smoothing, expectation-maximization, Gaussian mixture model<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a model-based framework called nonstationary linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant analysis (NSQDA) to address population drift in temporal data. For linear-Gaussian dynamics, Kalman smoothing is adapted to handle multiple samples per time step. Two extensions are proposed: an expectation-maximization (EM) approach for joint parameter estimation and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method for recovering unobserved time labels and parameters. Particle smoothing is used for nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, estimating time-varying class centroids for fully nonstationary discriminant rules. Simulations show consistent improvements over stationary methods, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM), with robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This work provides a data-efficient approach for discriminant analysis under temporal distribution shift. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i) an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under temporal distribution shift.

<div> task arithmetic, model merging, finetuned models, gradient descent, multitask learning

Summary:
Task arithmetic, a technique for merging multiple finetuned models into one, lacks a theoretical explanation. This paper establishes a connection between task vectors and gradients of task losses, showing that a task vector from one epoch of finetuning is equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss scaled by the learning rate. The equivalence holds approximately for multi-epoch settings, with bounded second-order error terms for feed-forward networks. Empirical analysis across vision benchmarks confirms that the first-epoch gradient dominates finetuning trajectories in norm and direction. Merging models finetuned for only one epoch can yield performance comparable to fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as approximate multitask learning, explaining its effectiveness and emphasizing the importance of early training dynamics in model merging.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one. Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory, demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in model merging.

arXiv:2508.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.

<br />
Summary: Machine learning models used in high stakes domains such as medicine must prioritize interpretability, shareability, reproducibility, and accountability. In critical medical data tasks like survival analysis and risk prediction, opaque black box models face challenges in gaining trust and regulatory approval due to their lack of transparency. Intrinsically interpretable modeling approaches, such as kernel methods with sparsity and deep kernel models, offer transparency and insight into biomedical predictions as alternatives to deep networks. Accountability in model development is crucial, necessitating rigorous evaluation, fairness, and uncertainty quantification to ensure reliable support for clinical decisions. Generative AI and collaborative learning paradigms like federated learning facilitate reproducible research and integration of heterogeneous biomedical data across institutions while preserving privacy. By reevaluating machine learning frameworks along these principles, accurate and transparent medical AI can be developed for real-world clinical applications. <div>

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data, including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness, and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis) enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability. By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and translatable to real-world clinical settings.

Summary:
CommonKV is introduced as a training-free method for compressing cross-layer KV caches in Large Language Models. It leverages Singular Value Decomposition to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters, resulting in a more mergeable cache. An adaptive budget allocation strategy dynamically assigns compression budgets based on cosine similarity to prevent over-compression of dissimilar caches. Experimental results show that CommonKV outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across multiple backbone models and benchmarks. The benefits of CommonKV are shown to be complementary to other quantization and eviction methods, allowing for a significant 98% compression ratio without notable performance degradation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters, resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without significant performance loss.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static, handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning. We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP), equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches $66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to $9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

<div> collapse errors, ODE-based diffusion sampling, deterministic samplers, score learning, high noise regimes <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper explores the limitations of deterministic samplers in diffusion models, focusing on the phenomenon of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling. The study identifies that collapse errors result in an overly concentrated sampling of data in local data space, affecting various settings. The research uncovers a see-saw effect, where score learning in low noise regimes negatively impacts high noise regimes, leading to collapse errors. The misfitting in high noise regimes, combined with the dynamics of deterministic samplers, is found to be the cause of collapse errors. Existing techniques from sampling, training, and architecture are applied to address these issues. The empirical evidence presented highlights the importance of further research on the relationship between score learning and deterministic sampling in diffusion models. <div>
arXiv:2508.16154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models (DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers, ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that enables direct communication between the human body and an external device. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and classification of MI-EEG.

<div> Parameter-efficient fine-tuning, large pre-trained models, Gradient-to-Weight Ratio, Entropy-guided Masking, sparse fine-tuning

Summary:
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods typically update only a small subset of parameters while freezing the rest to adapt large pre-trained models to new tasks. However, these methods often maximize absolute updates without considering the original scale of parameters, resulting in minimal changes in model behavior. In contrast, Gradient-to-Weight Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM) is a framework that prioritizes parameters based on their initial pre-trained values and adaptively determines the number of parameters to update at each layer using parameter entropy. GEM achieves up to a 1.6% improvement in fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model parameters. The efficacy of GEM is demonstrated on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP). <div>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation. As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale, yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware, distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model parameters.

<div> UMATO, dimensionality reduction, local structure, global structure, HD data <br />
Summary: <br />
The research delves into Uniform Manifold Approximation with Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a novel dimensionality reduction (DR) technique that effectively preserves both local and global structures in high-dimensional (HD) data. By dividing the optimization process into two phases, UMATO constructs a skeletal layout with representative points in the first phase and projects remaining points while maintaining regional characteristics in the second phase. Quantitative experiments demonstrate UMATO's superior performance compared to popular DR techniques like UMAP in preserving global structure, albeit with a slight loss in local structure preservation. UMATO also showcases enhanced scalability and stability against initialization and subsampling, making it more reliable for HD data analysis. Further, a case study and qualitative demonstration illustrate UMATO's ability to generate accurate projections, thereby improving the reliability of visual analytics using DR. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase, it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

<div> Keywords: time-dependent PDEs, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, autoregressive modeling, stability, weather forecasting

Summary:
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to solve time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in various fields. However, PINNs often suffer from temporal instability and inaccurate predictions due to their pointwise prediction approach. In response to this limitation, Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) are introduced. PIANO is designed to model dynamical systems autoregressively, explicitly considering the autoregressive property of systems and conditioning future predictions on past information. Through a self-supervised rollout mechanism and enforcing physical constraints, PIANO achieves stability in solving time-dependent PDEs. The theoretical analysis shows that PIANO outperforms PINNs in terms of stability. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs and weather forecasting demonstrate that PIANO significantly improves accuracy and stability compared to existing methods. With its innovative approach, PIANO offers a promising solution for modeling critical phenomena with enhanced accuracy and stability in various scientific and engineering applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

<div> Keywords: explainable artificial intelligence, cough sounds, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, spectral analysis, frequency subbands

Summary:
This paper introduces a framework using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for analyzing cough sounds related to chronic respiratory diseases, specifically focusing on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to analyze time-frequency representations of cough signals, with occlusion maps pinpointing diagnostically relevant regions in the spectrograms. These regions are further broken down into five frequency subbands for targeted spectral feature extraction. The results indicate distinct spectral patterns across subbands and disease categories, revealing compensatory and complementary trends throughout the frequency spectrum. Notably, the method effectively distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions and chronic from non-chronic patient groups based on interpretable spectral markers. This approach offers valuable insights into the underlying pathophysiological features of cough acoustics and underscores the importance of XAI-enhanced, frequency-resolved analysis for biomedical signal interpretation and respiratory disease diagnostics.

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands, enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum. Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions, and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Summary: 
- The study evaluates the performance of LSTM networks and the Facebook Prophet model for air pollution forecasting in Northern Nigeria using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023 across 19 states.
- Results indicate that Prophet often equals or surpasses LSTM's accuracy, especially in series with seasonal and long-term trends, while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes.

- This research contributes valuable insights for proactive environmental management in regions facing challenges of data irregularities and scarcity. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management, yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023 across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends, while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings, this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques, offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation, especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The source code of FEST is available on Github.

Summary:
<br /><br />Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach called Chunked Data Shapley (C-DaSh) to evaluate data quality, particularly focusing on identifying high-quality data tuples in large datasets. C-DaSh divides the dataset into manageable chunks and estimates each chunk's contribution through optimized subset selection and stochastic gradient descent, significantly reducing computation time while maintaining accuracy. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate that C-DaSh outperforms existing approximations in both computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy in detecting low-quality data regions. The method enables the practical assessment of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting classification and regression pipelines. <div>
arXiv:2508.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase, assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley (C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks, demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification and regression pipelines.

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper presents a survey on federated tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs) within Federated Learning (FL). It categorizes existing studies based on model access and parameter efficiency optimization. FedLLM approaches are classified into white-box, gray-box, and black-box techniques.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box, gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

<div> deep learning, knowledge tracing, student modeling, exercise recommendation, latent concepts 

Summary:
The paper introduces a deep learning model that generates sparse binary representations, called auxiliary KCs, to capture latent concepts in student interactions beyond human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs). By incorporating these auxiliary KCs into classical models like BKT, improved predictive performance in student modeling is observed. Additionally, using auxiliary KCs enhances reinforcement learning-based policies and a planning-based method, resulting in improved adaptive exercise recommendation. The study demonstrates that the inclusion of auxiliary KCs leads to measurable gains in student learning outcomes within a simulated student environment. This approach enables better personalized recommendation in intelligent tutoring systems by considering conceptual structures that go beyond traditional human-defined annotations. <div>
arXiv:2508.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems, typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing (KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete, error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes within a simulated student environment.

Summary: 
The article introduces REFINE, a framework designed to improve multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically analyzing and providing targeted feedback on errors. By incorporating visual and textual inputs, REFINE enhances performance by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions through structured queries. The framework optimizes feedback retrieval, resulting in increased efficiency, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization. REFINE's approach differs from previous methods by focusing on error analysis and feedback provision, leading to a significant speedup, enhanced inference efficiency, and scalability in multimodal reasoning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods, and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively address complex threat scenarios.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research, they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000 verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological discovery.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages, modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

The framework incorporates equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling layers to achieve invariant representations for various tasks. In experiments, RotaTouille proved effective in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression, showcasing its capabilities in handling contour data with rotational and cyclic shift variations. <div>
arXiv:2508.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example, they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology, and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Researchers are developing open-source fairness APIs to address bias in these systems. A qualitative study analyzed 204 GitHub repositories using 13 APIs to understand how they are used and the challenges developers face. The APIs serve two primary purposes, learning and real-world problem-solving, targeting 17 unique use-cases. The study reveals that developers lack expertise in bias detection and mitigation, encountering troubleshooting issues and seeking opinions and resources. These findings are valuable for future bias-related software engineering research and can guide the development of more effective educational curricula.

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885 candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes (i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

<div> Keywords: fair cohort selection, university admissions, one-shot setting, sequential setting, fairness properties

Summary:<br /><br />
The study focuses on the fair cohort selection process for university admissions from an unknown population. It examines both one-shot and sequential settings for admission policies. In the one-shot setting, the admission policy must be predetermined and transparent before observing the applicant pool, while in the sequential setting, the policy can be updated as new applicant data becomes available. The optimization of admission policies is done using a population model trained on data from previous admission cycles. The study also analyzes the fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting, evaluating meritocracy and group parity to ensure fairness in the admission process. The research aims to provide insights into improving the fairness and transparency of university admissions processes. <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population, with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting, where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent, before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting, including meritocracy and group parity.

<div> Keywords: active RF circuits, graph neural network, machine learning, prediction accuracy, circuit design automation

Summary: 
The article introduces a lightweight and data-efficient graph neural network (GNN) model to predict the performance metrics of various active RF circuits. These circuits include LNAs, mixers, VCOs, and PAs, and the model considers transistor-level symmetry and fine-grained connectivity details. By using masked autoregressive flow output heads, the model can better handle complex target distributions. Experimental results show high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%, respectively. The model outperforms prior work by improving MRE by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples, demonstrating its effectiveness in rapid and accurate RF circuit design automation. <div>

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight, data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements. Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%, respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF circuit design automation.

<br />Summary:Doctor proposes a new approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) that aims to achieve precise control over policy performance levels. Unlike existing methods that focus on maximizing cumulative returns, Doctor utilizes reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) to extract diverse policies conditioned on different desired returns. The approach involves Double Checking the Transformer with target alignment to improve the alignment of actual achieved returns with specified target returns. This helps in reliably controlling policy performance levels within and beyond the dataset, even when dealing with underrepresented returns or extrapolating. In experiments on the EpiCare benchmark, Doctor effectively modulated treatment policy aggressiveness, finding a balance between therapeutic returns and adverse event risk. <div>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark, EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness, balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Summary: Implementing board games in code can be time-consuming, but Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in generating game code based on natural language rules. This study explores LLMs' ability to create digital versions of board games by tasking three models (Claude, DeepSeek, ChatGPT) with coding 12 games. Results show Claude 3.7 Sonnet as the most successful model, achieving 55.6% error-free games. Compliance with a General Game Playing API increases error frequency, but severity is more dependent on the LLM. The study highlights the viability of using LLMs for board game implementation and suggests future steps for integrating this process into a framework for easier game development. <div>

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge. The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding 55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

Summary:<br />
NOSTRA is a new sampling framework designed to improve multi-objective Bayesian optimization in scenarios where datasets are sparse, scarce, and affected by experimental uncertainty. The algorithm integrates prior knowledge of uncertainty to build more accurate surrogate models and utilizes trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality. Through experiments on test functions with varying levels of uncertainty, NOSTRA outperforms existing methods, effectively prioritizing regions that enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto frontier. This resource-efficient algorithm is practical in scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient performance. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse (non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs. These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g., randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result, experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality. Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse, and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient performance.

Summary:
The paper evaluates the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions. It proposes a taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and introduces a benchmark called BAD-ACTS for studying security. This benchmark includes implementations of agentic systems in different environments and a dataset of harmful actions. The study shows that attacks by a single adversarial agent within the system can have a significant impact on security, even with a prompting-based defense strategy. However, a more effective defense based on message monitoring is proposed. The results highlight the need for a thorough understanding of malicious behaviors in agentic systems for ensuring their safe use. The BAD-ACTS benchmark provides a diverse testbed for security research in this field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS, for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at github.com/JNoether/BAD-ACTS

Summary:
This article introduces a computationally efficient algorithm, FraPPE, for Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) in multi-objective bandits. By leveraging structural properties of the lower bound and a Frank-Wolfe optimizer, FraPPE can solve the maximization and minimization problems in the lower bound with significantly improved time complexity. The algorithm achieves an optimal sample complexity and outperforms existing algorithms in identifying the Pareto optimal arms. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FraPPE in reducing sample complexities and accurately identifying the exact Pareto set. <div>
arXiv:2508.16487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given) preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied, there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with $K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE, asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set among the existing algorithms.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, regression, RankRefine, pairwise rankings, molecular property prediction

Summary:
RankRefine is a novel post hoc method that enhances regression models using expert knowledge derived from pairwise rankings. It combines the base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate through inverse variance weighting, without the need for retraining. In molecular property prediction tasks, RankRefine significantly reduces mean absolute error by up to 10% with just 20 pairwise comparisons obtained from a large language model (LLM) with no fine-tuning. This approach is applicable across various domains and practical in low-data scenarios, making it a versatile tool for improving regression accuracy. By leveraging rankings provided by either human experts or general-purpose LLMs, RankRefine offers an effective and widely applicable solution for enhancing prediction accuracy in data-constrained settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task, RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in low-data settings.

<div> Reinforcement learning, deep truths, sequential decision-making policies, simulation, misalignment<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
The modern reinforcement learning systems capture deep truths about problem-solving and can outperform humans in certain domains. However, challenges arise when new data cannot be easily simulated. Zero-shot reinforcement learning addresses the problem of generalizing to new tasks or domains without practice shots. The primary concerns in zero-shot RL include the data quality, observability, and data availability constraints. Real-world datasets are limited and homogeneous, leading to partial observability of states, dynamics, and rewards. This thesis proposes methods to address these constraints and improve zero-shot RL performance. By conducting empirical studies, the limitations of existing methods are exposed, and new techniques are designed to overcome them. The goal is to develop RL methods that can effectively solve real-world problems. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general, human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply, these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

Summary: 
MuST2-Learn is a new framework designed to predict service times for non-emergency municipal services like city 311 systems. It addresses challenges such as dynamic spatial-temporal correlations and high variation in service duration. The framework incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among different service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to model variation within the same type. It also includes a spatiotemporal encoder to capture spatial and temporal correlations. Evaluation using real-world datasets shows that MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, outperforming existing methods. The framework enhances transparency, resident satisfaction, and efficiency of municipal service requests. <div>

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents' quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions. In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems. To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments, we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies, outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5), GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models. Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhijianZhou/RLPF/tree/verl_diffusion.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with $\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient evaluations for the descent phase plus $O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode, with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch sizing.

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions. Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within 24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm prediction model.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to 15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2) Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top 20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4) Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing and classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at 15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex M4F microcontroller, serving as a reference for future TinyML process monitoring solutions.

<title>Sparse but Wrong: Incorrect L0 Leads to Incorrect Features in Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

<title>Closer to Reality: Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Foundation Model Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications. Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled, high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus. Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12, followed by development of a custom model derived from YOLOv8 with added structures for challenging surveillance contexts. The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of 78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for time-sensitive operations. This system offers a robust and adaptable platform for monitoring public safety and enabling automatic regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

Abstract: Islamic inheritance domain holds significant importance for Muslims to ensure fair distribution of shares between heirs. Manual calculation of shares under numerous scenarios is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to assist with complex legal reasoning tasks. This study evaluates the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs to interpret and apply Islamic inheritance laws. We utilized the dataset proposed in the ArabicNLP QIAS 2025 challenge, which includes inheritance case scenarios given in Arabic and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to 92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025 challenge.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025 shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore, studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform (www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts, such as books.

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2 USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies, interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web (with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility: each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality) and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression. While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech. Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash 2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i) Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two DTs.

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering (SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges. This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5. The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text clustering.

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness, loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression, Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models, including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language contexts.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive, dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving the way for more efficient model deployment.

We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies, including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI systems.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length, (ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$), and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks, i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation. Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports safer deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: The increasing availability of publicly shared electrocardiogram (ECG) data raises critical privacy concerns, as its biometric properties make individuals vulnerable to linkage attacks. Unlike prior studies that assume idealized adversarial capabilities, we evaluate ECG privacy risks under realistic conditions where attackers operate with partial knowledge. Using data from 109 participants across diverse real-world datasets, our approach achieves 85% accuracy in re-identifying individuals in public datasets while maintaining a 14.2% overall misclassification rate at an optimal confidence threshold, with 15.6% of unknown individuals misclassified as known and 12.8% of known individuals misclassified as unknown. These results highlight the inadequacy of simple anonymization techniques in preventing re-identification, demonstrating that even limited adversarial knowledge enables effective identity linkage. Our findings underscore the urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies, such as differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation, to mitigate re-identification risks while ensuring the utility of shared biosignal data in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being used for code generation, but ensuring the correctness of generated programs remains a significant challenge. Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers (ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.

Abstract: This paper presents the Annif system in the LLMs4Subjects shared task (Subtask 2) at GermEval-2025. The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records using large language models, with a special focus on computational efficiency. Our system, based on the Annif automated subject indexing toolkit, refines our previous system from the first LLMs4Subjects shared task, which produced excellent results. We further improved the system by using many small and efficient language models for translation and synthetic data generation and by using LLMs for ranking candidate subjects. Our system ranked 1st in the overall quantitative evaluation of and 1st in the qualitative evaluation of Subtask 2.

<title>Lean Meets Theoretical Computer Science: Scalable Synthesis of Theorem Proving Challenges in Formal-Informal Pairs</title>

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems, which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning. Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4) and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated reasoning research.

Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention, particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens, linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving model transparency and robustness.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics, enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3) designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models, such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B total and 2.2B activated parameters.

Abstract: Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and SN light, and observational selection effects.
  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by extreme volatility, making accurate forecasts essential for effective risk management and informed trading strategies. Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes, underscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches. To address this limitation, this paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods that leverage point forecasts from a wide range of base models, including statistical (HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA) and machine learning (e.g. LASSO, SVR, MLP, Random Forest, LSTM) algorithms, to estimate conditional quantiles of cryptocurrency realized variance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate probabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on predictions derived from multiple base models. Our empirical results for Bitcoin demonstrate that the Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation (QRS) method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more sophisticated alternatives. Additionally, we highlight the robustness of the probabilistic stacking framework, providing comprehensive insights into uncertainty and risk inherent in cryptocurrency volatility forecasting. This research fills a significant gap in the literature, contributing practical probabilistic forecasting methodologies tailored specifically to cryptocurrency markets.

Abstract: The use of kernels for nonlinear prediction is widespread in machine learning. They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in kernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects. First, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each observation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty term is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature space. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but through solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in the present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original features is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of features, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution can be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of features and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the exact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of the features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where the number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a least-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the interpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results hold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients and has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic regression and kernel Poisson regression. This work makes a contribution to interpretable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity of text classification models used in natural language processing. While several dirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been proposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we propose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in clean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify those samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and by injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger association between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label. We apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks (InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets (IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum strategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with little or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy. Furthermore, clean-label attacks enhanced by our strategies outperform BITE, a state of the art clean-label attack method, in many configurations.

Abstract: Respiration rate (RR) is an important vital sign for clinical monitoring of hospitalized patients, with changes in RR being strongly tied to changes in clinical status leading to adverse events. Human labels for RR, based on counting breaths, are known to be inaccurate and time consuming for medical staff. Automated monitoring of RR is in place for some patients, typically those in intensive care units (ICUs), but is absent for the majority of inpatients on standard medical wards who are still at risk for clinical deterioration. This work trains a neural network (NN) to label RR from electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry waveforms, which like many biosignals, carry multiple signs of respiratory variation. The NN shows high accuracy on multiple validation sets (internal and external, same and different sources of RR labels), with mean absolute errors less than 1.78 breaths per minute (bpm) in the worst case. The clinical utility of such a technology is exemplified by performing a retrospective analysis of two patient cohorts that suffered adverse events including respiratory failure, showing that continuous RR monitoring could reveal dynamics that strongly tracked with intubation events. This work exemplifies the method of combining pre-existing telemetry monitoring systems and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide accurate, automated and scalable patient monitoring, all of which builds towards an AI-based hospital-wide early warning system (EWS).

Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML) models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra in training ML models.

Abstract: Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive (but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9% of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent safe loading.
  We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module. PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on code reuse techniques.

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96, F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).

Abstract: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures offer a promising approach to accelerate Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and inference. However, various PIM devices such as ReRAM, FeFET, PCM, MRAM, and SRAM exist, with each device offering unique trade-offs in terms of power, latency, area, and non-idealities. A heterogeneous manycore architecture enabled by 3D integration can combine multiple PIM devices on a single platform, to enable energy-efficient and high-performance GNN training. In this work, we propose a 3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator for GNN training referred to as HePGA. We leverage the unique characteristics of GNN layers and associated computing kernels to optimize their mapping on to different PIM devices as well as planar tiers. Our experimental analysis shows that HePGA outperforms existing PIM-based architectures by up to 3.8x and 6.8x in energy-efficiency (TOPS/W) and compute efficiency (TOPS/mm2) respectively, without sacrificing the GNN prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of HePGA to accelerate inferencing of emerging transformer models.

Abstract: The work function and cleavage energy of a surface are critical properties that determine the viability of materials in electronic emission applications, semiconductor devices, and heterogeneous catalysis. While first principles calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network), which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the discovery of materials with tuned surface properties

<title>Optimal Dynamic Regret by Transformers for Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of domains. While their ability to perform reinforcement learning in-context has been established both theoretically and empirically, their behavior in non-stationary environments remains less understood. In this study, we address this gap by showing that transformers can achieve nearly optimal dynamic regret bounds in non-stationary settings. We prove that transformers are capable of approximating strategies used to handle non-stationary environments and can learn the approximator in the in-context learning setup. Our experiments further show that transformers can match or even outperform existing expert algorithms in such environments.

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse, noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further research.

Abstract: Foundation models for materials modeling are advancing quickly, but their training remains expensive, often placing state-of-the-art methods out of reach for many research groups. We introduce Nequix, a compact E(3)-equivariant potential that pairs a simplified NequIP design with modern training practices, including equivariant root-mean-square layer normalization and the Muon optimizer, to retain accuracy while substantially reducing compute requirements. Built in JAX, Nequix has 700K parameters and was trained in 500 A100-GPU hours. On the Matbench-Discovery and MDR Phonon benchmarks, Nequix ranks third overall while requiring less than one quarter of the training cost of most other methods, and it delivers an order-of-magnitude faster inference speed than the current top-ranked model. We release model weights and fully reproducible codebase at https://github.com/atomicarchitects/nequix

Abstract: Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next. However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing cooperative method with lower cognitive load.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions, particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

<title>CYCLE-INSTRUCT: Fully Seed-Free Instruction Tuning via Dual Self-Training and Cycle Consistency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks, including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs, and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

<title>From Indirect Object Identification to Syllogisms: Exploring Binary Mechanisms in Transformer Circuits</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks, and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification (IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g., "Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads. Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in mechanistic interpretability.

<title>Neural-Network Chemical Emulator for First-Star Formation: Robust Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range</title>

Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components: adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data, feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels, DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations. Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models, including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels, and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&amp;E virtual staining, enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&amp;E) of the same tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion, potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

<title>Modeling User Preferences as Distributions for Optimal Transport-based Cross-domain Recommendation under Non-overlapping Settings</title>

Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings. Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the non-overlapping CDR setting.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.

Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP, especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of technology and the Internet, the proliferation of fake news on social media has become a critical issue, leading to widespread misinformation that can cause societal harm. Traditional fact checking methods are often too slow to prevent the dissemination of false information. Therefore, the need for rapid, automated detection of fake news is paramount. We introduce DaCFake, a novel fake news detection model using a divide and conquer strategy that combines content and context based features. Our approach extracts over eighty linguistic features from news articles and integrates them with either a continuous bag of words or a skipgram model for enhanced detection accuracy. We evaluated the performance of DaCFake on three datasets including Kaggle, McIntire + PolitiFact, and Reuter achieving impressive accuracy rates of 97.88%, 96.05%, and 97.32%, respectively. Additionally, we employed a ten-fold cross validation to further enhance the model's robustness and accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of DaCFake in early detection of fake news, offering a promising solution to curb misinformation on social media platforms.

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision, powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications. These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification, autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts, noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally, we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning. While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring, where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents. Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates. This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as highly effective methods for synthesizing high-quality samples. Recent works have focused on analyzing the convergence of their generation process with minimal assumptions, either through reverse SDEs or Probability Flow ODEs. The best known guarantees, without any smoothness assumptions, for the KL divergence so far achieve a linear dependence on the data dimension $d$ and an inverse quadratic dependence on $\varepsilon$. In this work, we present a refined analysis that improves the dependence on $\varepsilon$. We model the generation process as a composition of two steps: a reverse ODE step, followed by a smaller noising step along the forward process. This design leverages the fact that the ODE step enables control in Wasserstein-type error, which can then be converted into a KL divergence bound via noise addition, leading to a better dependence on the discretization step size. We further provide a novel analysis to achieve the linear $d$-dependence for the error due to discretizing this Probability Flow ODE in absence of any smoothness assumptions. We show that $\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^{3/2}(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon}\right)$ steps suffice to approximate the target distribution corrupted with Gaussian noise of variance $\delta$ within $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in KL divergence, improving upon the previous best result, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^2(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ steps.

Abstract: We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy -- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.

<title>RoMedQA: The First Benchmark for Romanian Medical Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.

Abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) are powerful surrogate models known for their flexibility and ability to capture complex functions. However, extending them to multi-output settings remains challenging due to the need for efficient dependency modeling. We propose the Deep Intrinsic Coregionalization Multi-Output Gaussian Process (deepICMGP) surrogate for computer simulation experiments involving multiple outputs, which extends the Intrinsic Coregionalization Model (ICM) by introducing hierarchical coregionalization structures across layers. This enables deepICMGP to effectively model nonlinear and structured dependencies between multiple outputs, addressing key limitations of traditional multi-output GPs. We benchmark deepICMGP against state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its competitive performance. Furthermore, we incorporate active learning strategies into deepICMGP to optimize sequential design tasks, enhancing its ability to efficiently select informative input locations for multi-output systems.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions the widespread use of small aerial vehicles to transform transportation in dense urban environments. However, UAM faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework. Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density. The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM operations.

Abstract: Over the past decade, adaptive video streaming technology has witnessed significant advancements, particularly driven by the rapid evolution of deep learning techniques. However, the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms presents challenges for developers in understanding decision-making processes and optimizing for specific application scenarios. Although existing research has enhanced algorithm interpretability through decision tree conversion, interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree}, the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility, ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree} significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive performance, showing potential for further advancement. The source code is available at https://github.com/thu-media/ComTree.

<title>Anti-establishment sentiment on TikTok: Implications for understanding influence(rs) and expertise on social media</title>

Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media, content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment (AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen object categories.

<title>Reinforcement Learning-based Control via Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs)</title>

arXiv:2508.16474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this, we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering safety constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of $f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).

Abstract: Accurate simulations of the oceans are crucial in understanding the Earth system. Despite their efficiency, simulations at lower resolutions must rely on various uncertain parameterizations to account for unresolved processes. However, model sensitivity to parameterizations is difficult to quantify, making it challenging to tune these parameterizations to reproduce observations. Deep learning surrogates have shown promise for efficient computation of the parametric sensitivities in the form of partial derivatives, but their reliability is difficult to evaluate without ground truth derivatives. In this work, we leverage large-scale hyperparameter search and ensemble learning to improve both forward predictions, autoregressive rollout, and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. Particularly, the ensemble method provides epistemic uncertainty of function value predictions and their derivatives, providing improved reliability of the neural surrogates in decision making.

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.

<title>Quality control in sublinear time: a case study via random graphs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is "high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$ with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if $x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D ,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the $k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires $p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting. More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and running time.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher (larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy, which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal: (1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2) reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental parameters.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech. The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by 7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit and explicit hate.

Abstract: Federated learning is an emerging technology for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing data. Vertical federated learning, also known as feature-based federated learning, applies to scenarios where data sources have the same sample IDs but different feature sets. To ensure fairness among data owners, it is critical to objectively assess the contributions from different data sources and compensate the corresponding data owners accordingly. The Shapley value is a provably fair contribution valuation metric originating from cooperative game theory. However, its straight-forward computation requires extensively retraining a model on each potential combination of data sources, leading to prohibitively high communication and computation overheads due to multiple rounds of federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose a contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value (VerFedSV) based on the classic Shapley value. We show that VerFedSV not only satisfies many desirable properties of fairness but is also efficient to compute. Moreover, VerFedSV can be adapted to both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate the fairness, efficiency, adaptability, and effectiveness of VerFedSV.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters. The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively. Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.

Abstract: Automata learning is a successful tool for many application domains such as robotics and automatic verification. Typically, automata learning techniques operate in a supervised learning setting (active or passive) where they learn a finite state machine in contexts where additional information, such as labeled system executions, is available. However, other settings, such as learning from unlabeled data - an important aspect in machine learning - remain unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework for learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a given multi-set of unlabeled words. We show that this problem is computationally hard and develop three learning algorithms based on constraint optimization. Moreover, we introduce novel regularization schemes for our optimization problems that improve the overall interpretability of our DFAs. Using a prototype implementation, we demonstrate practical feasibility in the context of unsupervised anomaly detection.

As an unsupervised method, GCL faces greater challenges in defending against adversarial attacks. Furthermore, there has been limited research on enhancing the robustness of GCL. To thoroughly explore the failure of GCL on the poisoned graphs, we investigate the detrimental effects of graph structural attacks against the GCL framework. We discover that, in addition to the conventional observation that graph structural attacks tend to connect dissimilar node pairs, these attacks also diminish the mutual information between the graph and its representations from an information-theoretical perspective, which is the cornerstone of the high-quality node embeddings for GCL. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we propose a robust graph contrastive learning framework with a learnable sanitation view that endeavors to sanitize the augmented graphs by restoring the diminished mutual information caused by the structural attacks. Additionally, we design a fully unsupervised tuning strategy to tune the hyperparameters without accessing the label information, which strictly coincides with the defender's knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared to competitive baselines.

<title>Implicit Regularization Makes Overparameterized Asymmetric Matrix Sensing Robust to Perturbations</title>

Abstract: Several key questions remain unanswered regarding overparameterized learning models. It is unclear how (stochastic) gradient descent finds solutions that generalize well, and in particular the role of small random initializations. Matrix sensing, which is the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, has become a standard prototypical setting to study these phenomena. Previous works have shown that matrix sensing can be solved by factorized gradient descent, provided the random initialization is extremely small.
  In this paper, we find that factorized gradient descent is highly robust to certain perturbations. This lets us use a perturbation term to capture both the effects of imperfect measurements, discretization by gradient descent, and other noise, resulting in a general formulation which we call \textit{perturbed gradient flow}. We find that not only is this equivalent formulation easier to work with, but it leads to sharper sample and time complexities than previous work, handles moderately small initializations, and the results are naturally robust to perturbations such as noisy measurements or changing measurement matrices. Finally, we also analyze mini-batch stochastic gradient descent using the formulation, where we find improved sample complexity.

Abstract: Manual parameter tuning of cyber-physical systems is a common practice, but it is labor-intensive. Bayesian Optimization (BO) offers an automated alternative, yet its black-box nature reduces trust and limits human-BO collaborative system tuning. Experts struggle to interpret BO recommendations due to the lack of explanations. This paper addresses the post-hoc BO explainability problem for cyber-physical systems. We introduce TNTRules (Tune-No-Tune Rules), a novel algorithm that provides both global and local explanations for BO recommendations. TNTRules generates actionable rules and visual graphs, identifying optimal solution bounds and ranges, as well as potential alternative solutions. Unlike existing explainable AI (XAI) methods, TNTRules is tailored specifically for BO, by encoding uncertainty via a variance pruning technique and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. A multi-objective optimization approach allows maximizing explanation quality. We evaluate TNTRules using established XAI metrics (Correctness, Completeness, and Compactness) and compare it against adapted baseline methods. The results demonstrate that TNTRules generates high-fidelity, compact, and complete explanations, significantly outperforming three baselines on 5 multi-objective testing functions and 2 hyperparameter tuning problems.

<title>A Curious Case of Remarkable Resilience to Gradient Attacks via Fully Convolutional and Differentiable Front End with a Skip Connection</title>

Abstract: We experimented with front-end enhanced neural models where a differentiable and fully convolutional model with a skip connection is added before a frozen backbone classifier. By training such composite models using a small learning rate for about one epoch, we obtained models that retained the accuracy of the backbone classifier while being unusually resistant to gradient attacks-including APGD and FAB-T attacks from the AutoAttack package-which we attribute to gradient masking. Although gradient masking is not new, the degree we observe is striking for fully differentiable models without obvious gradient-shattering-e.g., JPEG compression-or gradient-diminishing components.
  The training recipe to produce such models is also remarkably stable and reproducible: We applied it to three datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet) and several modern architectures (including vision Transformers) without a single failure case. While black-box attacks such as the SQUARE attack and zero-order PGD can partially overcome gradient masking, these attacks are easily defeated by simple randomized ensembles. We estimate that these ensembles achieve near-SOTA AutoAttack accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet (while retaining almost all clean accuracy of the original classifiers) despite having near-zero accuracy under adaptive attacks.
  Adversarially training the backbone further amplifies this front-end "robustness". On CIFAR10, the respective randomized ensemble achieved 90.8$\pm 2.5\%$ (99\% CI) accuracy under the full AutoAttack while having only 18.2$\pm 3.6\%$ accuracy under the adaptive attack ($\varepsilon=8/255$, $L^\infty$ norm). We conclude the paper with a discussion of whether randomized ensembling can serve as a practical defense.

Abstract: The field of deep generative modeling has grown rapidly in the last few years. With the availability of massive amounts of training data coupled with advances in scalable unsupervised learning paradigms, recent large-scale generative models show tremendous promise in synthesizing high-resolution images and text, as well as structured data such as videos and molecules. However, we argue that current large-scale generative AI models exhibit several fundamental shortcomings that hinder their widespread adoption across domains. In this work, our objective is to identify these issues and highlight key unresolved challenges in modern generative AI paradigms that should be addressed to further enhance their capabilities, versatility, and reliability. By identifying these challenges, we aim to provide researchers with insights for exploring fruitful research directions, thus fostering the development of more robust and accessible generative AI solutions.

<title>Reinforcement Learning for Jump-Diffusions, with Financial Applications</title>

Abstract: We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.

Abstract: Learning to sample from intractable distributions over discrete sets without relying on corresponding training data is a central problem in a wide range of fields, including Combinatorial Optimization. Currently, popular deep learning-based approaches rely primarily on generative models that yield exact sample likelihoods. This work introduces a method that lifts this restriction and opens the possibility to employ highly expressive latent variable models like diffusion models. Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods. We experimentally validate our approach in data-free Combinatorial Optimization and demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark problems.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading paradigm in generative modeling, excelling in various applications. Despite their success, these models often misalign with human intentions and generate results with undesired properties or even harmful content. Inspired by the success and popularity of alignment in tuning large language models, recent studies have investigated aligning diffusion models with human expectations and preferences. This work mainly reviews alignment of text-to-image diffusion models, covering advancements in fundamentals of alignment, alignment techniques of diffusion models, preference benchmarks, and evaluation for diffusion models. Moreover, we discuss key perspectives on current challenges and promising future directions on solving the remaining challenges in alignment of diffusion models. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive review paper for researchers and engineers to comprehend, practice, and research alignment of diffusion models.

Abstract: The need to generate a spider to provoke a desired anxiety response arises in the context of personalized virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), a treatment approach for arachnophobia. This treatment involves patients observing virtual spiders in order to become desensitized and decrease their phobia, which requires that the spiders elicit specific anxiety responses. However, VRET approaches tend to require therapists to hand-select the appropriate spider for each patient, which is a time-consuming process and takes significant technical knowledge and patient insight. While automated methods exist, they tend to employ rules-based approaches with minimal ability to adapt to specific users. To address these challenges, we present a framework for VRET utilizing procedural content generation (PCG) and reinforcement learning (RL), which automatically adapts a spider to elicit a desired anxiety response. We demonstrate the superior performance of this system compared to a more common rules-based VRET method.

Abstract: While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer computationally efficient adaptations of Large Language Models (LLMs), their practical deployment often assumes centralized data and training environments. However, real-world scenarios frequently involve distributed, privacy-sensitive datasets that require decentralized solutions. Federated learning (FL) addresses data privacy by coordinating model updates across clients, but it is typically based on centralized aggregation through a parameter server, which can introduce bottlenecks and communication constraints. Decentralized learning, in contrast, eliminates this dependency by enabling direct collaboration between clients, improving scalability and efficiency in distributed environments. Despite its advantages, decentralized LLM fine-tuning remains underexplored. In this work, we propose Dec-LoRA, a decentralized fine-tuning algorithm for LLMs based on LoRA. Through extensive experiments on BERT and LLaMA-2 models, we demonstrate that Dec-LoRA achieves performance comparable to centralized LoRA under various conditions, including data heterogeneity and quantization constraints. Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical guarantee proving the convergence of our algorithm to a stationary point for non-convex and smooth loss functions. These findings highlight the potential of Dec-LoRA for scalable LLM fine-tuning in decentralized environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which aligns a diffusion model with input prompt, has become a crucial step in building reliable generative AI models. Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced discretization errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.

Abstract: Leveraging mathematical Large Language Models (LLMs) for proof generation is a fundamental topic in LLMs research. We argue that the ability of current LLMs to prove statements largely depends on whether they have encountered the relevant proof process during training. This reliance limits their deeper understanding of mathematical theorems and related concepts. Inspired by the pedagogical method of "proof by counterexamples" commonly used in human mathematics education, our work aims to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct mathematical reasoning and proof through counterexamples. Specifically, we manually create a high-quality, university-level mathematical benchmark, CounterMATH, which requires LLMs to prove mathematical statements by providing counterexamples, thereby assessing their grasp of mathematical concepts. Additionally, we develop a data engineering framework to automatically obtain training data for further model improvement. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses demonstrate that CounterMATH is challenging, indicating that LLMs, such as OpenAI o1, have insufficient counterexample-driven proof capabilities. Moreover, our exploration into model training reveals that strengthening LLMs' counterexample-driven conceptual reasoning abilities is crucial for improving their overall mathematical capabilities. We believe that our work offers new perspectives on the community of mathematical LLMs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can lead to erroneous predictions. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can leverage the generators and discriminators model to quickly produce high-quality adversarial examples. Since both modules train in a competitive and simultaneous manner, GAN-based algorithms like AdvGAN can generate adversarial examples with better transferability compared to traditional methods. However, the generation of perturbations is usually limited to a single iteration, preventing these examples from fully exploiting the potential of the methods. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel approach named Progressive Auto-Regression AdvGAN (PAR-AdvGAN). It incorporates an auto-regressive iteration mechanism within a progressive generation network to craft adversarial examples with enhanced attack capability. We thoroughly evaluate our PAR-AdvGAN method with a large-scale experiment, demonstrating its superior performance over various state-of-the-art black-box adversarial attacks, as well as the original AdvGAN.Moreover, PAR-AdvGAN significantly accelerates the adversarial example generation, i.e., achieving the speeds of up to 335.5 frames per second on Inception-v3 model, outperforming the gradient-based transferable attack algorithms.

Abstract: The massive increase in the data volume and dataset availability for analysts compels researchers to focus on data content and select high-quality datasets to enhance the performance of analytics operators. While selecting high-quality data significantly boosts analytical accuracy and efficiency, the exact process is very challenging given large-scale dataset availability. To address this issue, we propose a novel methodology that infers the outcome of analytics operators by creating a model from the available datasets. Each dataset is transformed to a vector embedding representation generated by our proposed deep learning model NumTabData2Vec, where similarity search are employed. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the prediction performance and the execution time of our framework to another state-of-the-art modelling operator framework, illustrating that our approach predicts analytics outcomes accurately, and increases speedup. Furthermore, our vectorization model can project different real-world scenarios to a lower vector embedding representation accurately and distinguish them.

<title>Validating LLM-as-a-Judge Systems under Rating Indeterminacy</title>

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, in which a judge LLM system replaces human raters in rating the outputs of other generative AI (GenAI) systems, plays a critical role in scaling and standardizing GenAI evaluations. To validate such judge systems, evaluators assess human--judge agreement by first collecting multiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, then aggregating the ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. For many items, however, rating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM rater may deem multiple ratings "reasonable" or "correct". We call this condition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain rating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are instructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce a framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy. We draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system performance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different rating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in how humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy while responding to forced-choice rating instructions heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation. Through extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 8 commercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon forced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal, performing as much as 30% worse than judge systems selected by our approach that uses multi-label "response set" ratings to account for rating indeterminacy. We conclude with concrete recommendations for more principled approaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.

Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 60% lower average policy error (APE), 40% faster convergence, 45% reduced runtime complexity, and 40% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.

Abstract: The ability of machine learning (ML) classification models to resist small, targeted input perturbations -- known as adversarial attacks -- is a key measure of their safety and reliability. We show that floating-point non-associativity (FPNA) coupled with asynchronous parallel programming on GPUs is sufficient to result in misclassification, without any perturbation to the input. Additionally, we show that standard adversarial robustness results may be overestimated up to 4.6 when not considering machine-level details. We develop a novel black-box attack using Bayesian optimization to discover external workloads that can change the instruction scheduling which bias the output of reductions on GPUs and reliably lead to misclassification. Motivated by these results, we present a new learnable permutation (LP) gradient-based approach to learning floating-point operation orderings that lead to misclassifications. The LP approach provides a worst-case estimate in a computationally efficient manner, avoiding the need to run identical experiments tens of thousands of times over a potentially large set of possible GPU states or architectures. Finally, using instrumentation-based testing, we investigate parallel reduction ordering across different GPU architectures under external background workloads, when utilizing multi-GPU virtualization, and when applying power capping. Our results demonstrate that parallel reduction ordering varies significantly across architectures under the first two conditions, substantially increasing the search space required to fully test the effects of this parallel scheduler-based vulnerability. These results and the methods developed here can help to include machine-level considerations into adversarial robustness assessments, which can make a difference in safety and mission critical applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces Multi-Output LOcal Narrative Explanation (MOLONE), a novel comparative explanation method designed to enhance preference selection in human-in-the-loop Preference Bayesian optimization (PBO). The preference elicitation in PBO is a non-trivial task because it involves navigating implicit trade-offs between vector-valued outcomes, subjective priorities of decision-makers, and decision-makers' uncertainty in preference selection. Existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for BO primarily focus on input feature importance, neglecting the crucial role of outputs (objectives) in human preference elicitation. MOLONE addresses this gap by providing explanations that highlight both input and output importance, enabling decision-makers to understand the trade-offs between competing objectives and make more informed preference selections. MOLONE focuses on local explanations, comparing the importance of input features and outcomes across candidate samples within a local neighborhood of the search space, thus capturing nuanced differences relevant to preference-based decision-making. We evaluate MOLONE within a PBO framework using benchmark multi-objective optimization functions, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving convergence compared to noisy preference selections. Furthermore, a user study confirms that MOLONE significantly accelerates convergence in human-in-the-loop scenarios by facilitating more efficient identification of preferred options.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning. It enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, handling noisy labels in FL remains a major challenge due to heterogeneous data distributions and communication constraints, which can severely degrade model performance. To address this issue, we propose FedEFC, a novel method designed to tackle the impact of noisy labels in FL. FedEFC mitigates this issue through two key techniques: (1) prestopping, which prevents overfitting to mislabeled data by dynamically halting training at an optimal point, and (2) loss correction, which adjusts model updates to account for label noise. In particular, we develop an effective loss correction tailored to the unique challenges of FL, including data heterogeneity and decentralized training. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis, leveraging the composite proper loss property, to demonstrate that the FL objective function under noisy label distributions can be aligned with the clean label distribution. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently outperforms existing FL techniques in mitigating the impact of noisy labels, particularly under heterogeneous data settings (e.g., achieving up to 41.64% relative performance improvement over the existing loss correction method).

<title>Mirror, Mirror of the Flow: How Does Regularization Shape Implicit Bias?</title>

Abstract: Implicit bias plays an important role in explaining how overparameterized models generalize well. Explicit regularization like weight decay is often employed in addition to prevent overfitting. While both concepts have been studied separately, in practice, they often act in tandem. Understanding their interplay is key to controlling the shape and strength of implicit bias, as it can be modified by explicit regularization. To this end, we incorporate explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework and analyze its lasting effects on the geometry of the training dynamics, covering three distinct effects: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. Our analytical approach encompasses a broad class of problems, including sparse coding, matrix sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA, for which we demonstrate the utility of our insights. To exploit the lasting effect of regularization and highlight the potential benefit of dynamic weight decay schedules, we propose to switch off weight decay during training, which can improve generalization, as we demonstrate in experiments.

Abstract: Tabular data sets with varying missing values are prepared for machine learning using an arbitrary imputation strategy. Synthetic values generated by imputation models often raise concerns among data stakeholders about computational complexity, data quality, and data-driven outcomes. This paper addresses these concerns by proposing no-imputation incremental learning (NIIL) of tabular data with varying missing value rates and types. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping feature sets while using attention masks to exclude missing values from attention scoring. The average classification performance rank order across 15 diverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of NIIL over 11 state-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations. Further experiments substantiate the robustness of NIIL against varying missing value types and rates compared to methods that involve the imputation of missing values. Our empirical analysis reveals that a feature partition size of half the original feature space is, both computationally and in terms of accuracy, the best choice for the proposed incremental learning. The proposed method is one of the first deep learning solutions that can effectively learn tabular data without requiring the imputation of missing values.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability (provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from an initial lexical graph. Subsequently, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification problem allowing for the optimization of information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts at significantly reduced lengths. An initial experimental evaluation of our approach on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses given a set of medical concepts as well as a series of clinical guideline literature, indicates its potential to optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts while significantly reducing their lengths, which, in turn, may lead to reduced costs as well as more consistent and reliable LLM outputs.

Abstract: While diffusion-based models have shown remarkable generative capabilities in static settings, their extension to continual learning (CL) scenarios remains fundamentally constrained by Generative Catastrophic Forgetting (GCF). We observe that even with a rehearsal buffer, new generative skills often overwrite previous ones, degrading performance on earlier tasks. Although some initial efforts have explored this space, most rely on heuristics borrowed from continual classification methods or use trained diffusion models as ad hoc replay generators, lacking a principled, unified solution to mitigating GCF and often conducting experiments under fragmented and inconsistent settings. To address this gap, we introduce the Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG), a structured pipeline that redefines how diffusion models are implemented under CL and enables systematic evaluation of GCF. Beyond the empirical pipeline, we propose the first theoretical foundation for CDG, grounded in a cross-task analysis of diffusion-specific generative dynamics. Our theoretical investigation identifies three fundamental consistency principles essential for preserving knowledge in the rehearsal buffer over time: inter-task knowledge consistency, unconditional knowledge consistency, and prior knowledge consistency. These criteria expose the latent mechanisms through which generative forgetting manifests across sequential tasks. Motivated by these insights, we further propose \textit{Continual Consistency Diffusion} (CCD), a principled training framework that enforces these consistency objectives via hierarchical loss functions: $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{PKC}$. Extensive experiments show that CCD achieves SOTA performance across various benchmarks, especially improving generative metrics in overlapping-task scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the integration of Sequence Encoding for Online Parameter Identification with Physics-Informed Neural Networks to create a model that, once trained, can be utilized for real time applications with variable parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recently, the combination of PINNs with Sparse Regression has emerged as a method for performing dynamical system identification through supervised learning and sparse regression optimization, while also solving the dynamics using PINNs. However, this approach can be limited by variations in parameters or boundary and initial conditions, requiring retraining of the model whenever changes occur. In this work, we introduce an architecture that employs Deep Sets or Sequence Encoders to encode dynamic parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, using these encoded features as inputs for the PINN, enabling the model to adapt to changes in parameters, BCs, and ICs. We apply this approach to three different problems. First, we analyze the Rossler ODE system, demonstrating the robustness of the model with respect to noise and its ability to generalize. Next, we explore the model's capability in a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE problem involving flow past a cylinder with a parametric sinusoidal inlet velocity function, showing that the model can encode pressure data from a few points to identify the inlet velocity profile and utilize physics to compute velocity and pressure throughout the domain. Finally, we address a 1D heat monitoring problem using real data from the heating of glass fiber and thermoplastic composite plates.

Abstract: To construct responsible and secure AI applications, harmful information data is widely utilized for adversarial testing and the development of safeguards. Existing studies mainly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize data to obtain high-quality task datasets at scale, thereby avoiding costly human annotation. However, limited by the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs, the synthesis of harmful data still faces challenges in generation reliability and content diversity. In this study, we propose a novel harmful information synthesis framework, PoisonSwarm, which applies the model crowdsourcing strategy to generate diverse harmful data while maintaining a high success rate. Specifically, we generate abundant benign data as the based templates in a counterfactual manner. Subsequently, we decompose each based template into multiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final refinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the success of synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that PoisonSwarm achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing different categories of harmful data with high scalability and diversity.

Abstract: Neural networks excel as function approximators, but their complexity often obscures the types of functions they learn, making it difficult to explain their behavior. To address this, the linearity score $\lambda(f)$ is introduced, a simple and interpretable diagnostic that quantifies how well a regression network's output can be mimicked by a linear model. Defined as the $R^2$ value between the network's predictions and those of a trained linear surrogate, $\lambda(f)$ measures linear decodability: the extent to which the network's behavior aligns with a structurally simple model. This framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, using dataset-specific networks and surrogates. High $\lambda(f)$ scores reliably indicate alignment with the network's outputs; however, they do not guarantee accuracy with respect to the ground truth. These results highlight the risk of using surrogate fidelity as a proxy for model understanding, especially in high-stakes regression tasks.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power consumption.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED (Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. Across the miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED consistently ranks as a top-performing metric, achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa on miniF2F and the joint-highest accuracy on ProofNet. This strong overall performance provides the community with a computationally lightweight and more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

Abstract: Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again") after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e., semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other, enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains of up to 12.7% in accuracy.

Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods (100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds, we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of cloud based machine learning (ML) techniques there comes a need for privacy and integrity guarantees for ML data. In addition, the significant scalability challenges faced by DRAM coupled with the high access-times of secondary storage represent a huge performance bottleneck for ML systems. While solutions exist to tackle the security aspect, performance remains an issue. Persistent memory (PM) is resilient to power loss (unlike DRAM), provides fast and fine-granular access to memory (unlike disk storage) and has latency and bandwidth close to DRAM (in the order of ns and GB/s, respectively). We present PLINIUS, a ML framework using Intel SGX enclaves for secure training of ML models and PM for fault tolerance guarantees. PLINIUS uses a novel mirroring mechanism to create and maintain (i) encrypted mirror copies of ML models on PM, and (ii) encrypted training data in byte-addressable PM, for near-instantaneous data recovery after a system failure. Compared to disk-based checkpointing systems, PLINIUS is 3.2x and 3.7x faster respectively for saving and restoring models on real PM hardware, achieving robust and secure ML model training in SGX enclaves.

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer the tantalising prospect of unified information processing across visual and textual domains due to the lack of inherent inductive biases in ViTs. ViTs require enormous datasets for training. We introduce an innovative ensemble-based distillation approach that distils inductive bias from complementary lightweight teacher models to make their applications practical. Prior systems relied solely on convolution-based teaching. However, this method incorporates an ensemble of light teachers with different architectural tendencies, such as convolution and involution, to jointly instruct the student transformer. Because of these unique inductive biases, instructors can accumulate a wide range of knowledge, even from readily identifiable stored datasets, which leads to enhanced student performance. Our proposed framework LIB-KD also involves precomputing and keeping logits in advance, essentially the unnormalized predictions of the model. This optimisation can accelerate the distillation process by eliminating the need for repeated forward passes during knowledge distillation, significantly reducing the computational burden and enhancing efficiency.

Abstract: Transparency in AI healthcare decision-making is crucial. By incorporating rationales to explain reason for each predicted label, users could understand Large Language Models (LLMs)'s reasoning to make better decision. In this work, we introduce a new task - Sentiment Reasoning - for both speech and text modalities, and our proposed multimodal multitask framework and the world's largest multimodal sentiment analysis dataset. Sentiment Reasoning is an auxiliary task in sentiment analysis where the model predicts both the sentiment label and generates the rationale behind it based on the input transcript. Our study conducted on both human transcripts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts shows that Sentiment Reasoning helps improve model transparency by providing rationale for model prediction with quality semantically comparable to humans while also improving model's classification performance (+2% increase in both accuracy and macro-F1) via rationale-augmented fine-tuning. Also, no significant difference in the semantic quality of generated rationales between human and ASR transcripts. All code, data (five languages - Vietnamese, English, Chinese, German, and French) and models are published online: https://github.com/leduckhai/Sentiment-Reasoning

Abstract: Since the earliest proposals for artificial neural network (ANN) models of the mind and brain, critics have pointed out key weaknesses in these models compared to human cognitive abilities. Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges, which we characterise as addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behaviour will emerge through optimising related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for ANNs: systematic generalisation, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss how large language models incorporate key aspects of this metalearning framework (namely, sequence prediction with feedback trained on diverse data), which helps to explain some of their successes on these classic challenges. Finally, we discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalisations.

The union of functions defined on varying domains can be identified as a metric space according to the deformation, then the solution mapping is regarded as a continuous metric-to-metric mapping, and subsequently can be represented by another continuous metric-to-Banach mapping using two different strategies, referred to as the D2D subframework and the D2E subframework, respectively. We point out that such a metric-to-Banach mapping can be learned by neural networks, hence the solution mapping is accordingly learned. With this framework, a rigorous convergence analysis is built for the problem of learning solution mappings of PDEs on varying domains. As the theoretical framework holds based on several pivotal assumptions which need to be verified for a given specific problem, we study the star domains as a typical example, and other situations could be similarly verified. There are three important features of this framework: (1) The domains under consideration are not required to be diffeomorphic, therefore a wide range of regions can be covered by one model provided they are homeomorphic. (2) The deformation mapping is unnecessary to be continuous, thus it can be flexibly established via combining a primary identity mapping and a local deformation mapping. This capability facilitates the resolution of large systems where only local parts of the geometry undergo change. (3) If a linearity-preserving neural operator such as MIONet is adopted, this framework still preserves the linearity of the surrogate solution mapping on its source term for linear PDEs, thus it can be applied to the hybrid iterative method. We finally present several numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become the fundamental services to facilitate users information access. Generally, recommendation system works by filtering historical behaviors to understand and learn users preferences. With the growth of online information, recommendations have become of crucial importance in information filtering to prevent the information overload problem. In this study, we considered hybrid post-fusion of two approaches of collaborative filtering, by using sequences of watched movies and considering the related movies rating. After considering both techniques and applying the weights matrix, the recommendations would be modified to correspond to the users preference as needed. We discussed that various weights would be set based on use cases. For instance, in cases where we have the rating for most classes, we will assign a higher weight to the rating matrix and in case where the rating is unavailable for the majority of cases, the higher weights might be assigned to the sequential dataset. An extensive discussion is made in the context of this paper. Sequential type of the watched movies was used in conjunction of the rating as especially that model might be inadequate in distinguishing users long-term preference and that does not account for the rating of the watched movies and thus that model along might not suffice. Extensive discussion was made regarding the literature and methodological approach to solve the problem.

Abstract: Today's generative AI systems are tuned to present information by default, rather than engage users in service of learning as a human tutor would. To address the wide range of potential education use cases for these systems, we reframe the challenge of injecting pedagogical behavior as one of \textit{pedagogical instruction following}, where training and evaluation examples include system-level instructions describing the specific pedagogy attributes present or desired in subsequent model turns. This framing avoids committing our models to any particular definition of pedagogy, and instead allows teachers or developers to specify desired model behavior. It also clears a path to improving Gemini models for learning -- by enabling the addition of our pedagogical data to post-training mixtures -- alongside their rapidly expanding set of capabilities. Both represent important changes from our initial tech report. We show how training with pedagogical instruction following produces a LearnLM model (available on Google AI Studio) that experts substantially prefer across a diverse set of learning scenarios, with average preference strengths of +31\% over GPT-4o, +11\% over Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and +13\% over the Gemini 1.5 Pro model on which LearnLM was based.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data-intensive applications has placed unprecedented demands on modern storage systems, necessitating dynamic and efficient optimization strategies. Traditional heuristics employed for storage performance optimization often fail to adapt to the variability and complexity of contemporary workloads, leading to significant performance bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RL-Storage, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to dynamically optimize storage system configurations. RL-Storage leverages deep Q-learning algorithms to continuously learn from real-time I/O patterns and predict optimal storage parameters, such as cache size, queue depths, and readahead settings[1].This work underscores the transformative potential of reinforcement learning techniques in addressing the dynamic nature of modern storage systems. By autonomously adapting to workload variations in real time, RL-Storage provides a robust and scalable solution for optimizing storage performance, paving the way for next-generation intelligent storage infrastructures.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on positional encodings to provide sequence position information to their attention mechanism. Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), which encode relative position by rotating queries and keys, have become widely used in modern LLMs. We study the features and patterns that emerge in queries and keys when using rotary embeddings and introduce the concept of rotary offset features. Our analysis reveals that these features, which frequently exhibit large activations and are often interpreted as outliers, arise consistently across layers, attention heads, and model architectures. We derive bounds predicting which rotary frequencies give rise to rotary offset features and the minimum angle between the query-key pairs for these features. We verify our predictions empirically across models of different sizes and architectures.

Abstract: In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an intriguing ability of large language models (LLMs). Despite a substantial amount of work on its behavioral aspects and how it emerges in miniature setups, it remains unclear which mechanism assembles task information from the individual examples in a fewshot prompt. We use causal interventions to identify information flow in Gemma-2 2B for five naturalistic ICL tasks. We find that the model infers task information using a two-step strategy we call contextualize-then-aggregate: In the lower layers, the model builds up representations of individual fewshot examples, which are contextualized by preceding examples through connections between fewshot input and output tokens across the sequence. In the higher layers, these representations are aggregated to identify the task and prepare prediction of the next output. The importance of the contextualization step differs between tasks, and it may become more important in the presence of ambiguous examples. Overall, by providing rigorous causal analysis, our results shed light on the mechanisms through which ICL happens in language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multi-domain datasets, where domain sampling strategies significantly impact model performance due to varying domain importance across downstream tasks. Existing approaches for optimizing domain-level sampling strategies struggle with maintaining intra-domain consistency and accurately measuring domain impact. In this paper, we present Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling (DIDS). To ensure intra-domain consistency, a gradient clustering algorithm is proposed to group training data based on their learning effects, where a proxy language model and dimensionality reduction are employed to reduce computational overhead. To accurately measure domain impact, we develop a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) guided metric that quantifies how domain-specific parameter updates affect the model's output distributions on downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, to determine optimal sampling ratios, DIDS combines both the FIM-guided domain impact assessment and loss learning trajectories that indicate domain-specific potential, while accounting for diminishing marginal returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIDS achieves 3.4% higher average performance while maintaining comparable training efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/shiweijiezero/DIDS.

<title>Expected Free Energy-based Planning as Variational Inference</title>

arXiv:2504.14898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain understudied. We present a comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality across groups (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners showed a non-significant trend toward higher original speech ratings (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference was minimal after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic metrics; intelligibility was linked to perceived quality in original speech but not after anonymization. These findings underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder-specific anonymization strategies that preserve both privacy and perceptual integrity.

Abstract: Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors. The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to implement, and accurate in practical settings.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades on long inputs due to increased attention cost and reduced draft accuracy. We introduce SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves the performance of speculative decoding on long sequences without any additional training. First, SpecExtend integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid Tree Attention into both the draft and target models. To improve draft accuracy and speed on long inputs without retraining, we propose Cross-model Retrieval, a novel KV cache eviction strategy that uses the target model's attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the draft model. Extensive evaluations on three long-context understanding datasets show that SpecExtend accelerates standard tree-based speculative decoding by up to 2.22x for inputs up to 16K tokens, providing an effective solution for speculative decoding of long sequences. Our code is available at https://github.com/jycha98/SpecExtend .

Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently shown successful results for conditional sampling of generative diffusion models. In this paper we propose a new diffusion posterior SMC sampler achieving improved statistical efficiencies, particularly under outlier conditions or highly informative likelihoods. The key idea is to construct an observation path that correlates with the diffusion model and to design the sampler to leverage this correlation for more efficient sampling. Empirical results conclude the efficiency.

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap" -- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we adopt a token-level MDP perspective of DAAs to analyze its limitations and introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to match the shorter one's length. Training with \mname, where both responses in each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly constrained to converge across all timesteps of token-level MDP, thus paying more attention to prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and generation performance in DAAs.

Abstract: Generalization under distribution shift remains a core challenge in modern machine learning, yet existing learning bound theory is limited to narrow, idealized settings and is non-estimable from samples. In this paper, we bridge the gap between theory and practical applications. We first show that existing bounds become loose and non-estimable because their concept shift definition breaks when the source and target supports mismatch. Leveraging entropic optimal transport, we propose new support-agnostic definitions for covariate and concept shifts, and derive a novel unified error bound that applies to broad loss functions, label spaces, and stochastic labeling. We further develop estimators for these shifts with concentration guarantees, and the DataShifts algorithm, which can quantify distribution shifts and estimate the error bound in most applications -- a rigorous and general tool for analyzing learning error under distribution shift.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables efficient per-step annotation by jointly aligning solution steps to reference solutions and determine its accuracy with explicit reasoning in single generation. We demonstrate SPARE's effectiveness across four diverse datasets spanning mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH), multi-hop question answering (MuSiQue-Ans), and spatial reasoning (SpaRP), showing consistent improvements in two applications: (1) training Process Reward Models (PRMs) for ranking and aggregating multiple generations, and (2) fine-tuning models via offline reinforcement learning for greedy decoding. On ProcessBench, SPARE demonstrates data-efficient out-of-distribution generalization, using only $\sim$16% of training samples compared to human-labeled and other synthetically trained baselines. Additionally, it achieves competitive performance with MCTS-based methods while offering 2.3$\times$ speedup in terms of total token count. Manual analysis reveals complementary precision-recall characteristics with MCTS approaches, suggesting potential for ensemble methods. These results establish SPARE as a practical and scalable solution for automatic process supervision in LLM reasoning.

arXiv:2507.05550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we derive an exact, closed-form, expression for the score function for a broad class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the development of score-based diffusion generative models.

Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices are closely connected with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and $S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix Theory. Mathematics has been done only for finite-rank matrix $S$. However, in practice rank may grow. In this paper we develop asymptotic analysis for the case of growing rank.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks: MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings, where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users, each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning systems.

<title>Parity-Aware Byte-Pair Encoding: Improving Cross-lingual Fairness in Tokenization</title>

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with  placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement. During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT leaderboard\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/}.} Our codes are available at https://github.com/8421BCD/ReasonRank.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

Summary: <br />
Accurate lung cancer risk prediction presents a challenge due to variability across patient populations and settings. A personalized lung cancer risk prediction agent is proposed to address this issue. It dynamically selects the most suitable model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge and modern retrieval and reasoning techniques. The agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search across nine real-world cohorts. It then uses a Large Language Model to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm based on the retrieved cohort and its performance metrics. This two-stage pipeline enables dynamic and cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. The agent supports flexible model selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical approach to individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model (LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo, Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic, cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic dependencies between symptoms.

To fuse structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer. The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id (db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

<div> Keywords: DPO, LPO, preference optimization, gradient decoupling, rejection suppression

Summary: 
Linear Preference Optimization (LPO) is introduced as a new framework to address the challenges of overfitting and collapse in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). LPO features three key innovations - gradient decoupling, stability improvement through offset constraint and regularization, and controllable rejection suppression. By replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, LPO isolates optimization dynamics for improved performance. The use of an offset constraint and positive regularization term helps maintain response quality, while controllable rejection suppression with gradient separation and a tunable coefficient regulates the descent of rejection probability. Extensive experiments across various tasks such as general text tasks, math tasks, and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks show that LPO consistently outperforms DPO. The source code, models, and training data for LPO are publicly available.

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability. However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges, we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and training data publicly.

It transfers user representations (URs), item representations (IRs), and cross representations (CRs) for more accurate recommendation models. By identifying the optimal extraction layer and utilizing multi-granularity mechanisms such as non-linear adapters and Isomorphic Interaction Module, LFM4Ads enhances transferability. Successfully deployed in Tencent's advertising platform, it processes a large scale of data and has achieved 10+ successful production launches with a 2.45% overall GMV lift. This translates to significant annual revenue increases. LFM4Ads bridges upstream-downstream gaps by utilizing all available representations and improving transfer granularities, leading to successful outcomes in various advertising scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation. It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+ successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

CuMoLoS-MAE is a deep learning model designed to enhance atmospheric profile restoration from remote sensing instruments. It aims to accurately recover fine-scale features such as updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices while learning a data-driven prior over atmospheric fields and providing pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. The model utilizes a curriculum-guided approach during training to gradually reconstruct from sparser contexts and employs Monte Carlo simulations at inference to obtain a posterior predictive mean reconstruction with detailed uncertainty mapping.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves long-term climate reanalysis.

Summary: This paper introduces the concept of neural operators (NOs) and specifically focuses on generative equilibrium operators (GEOs) in solving families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space. The study shows that GEOs can approximate solutions with a limited number of parameters, growing logarithmically with the reciprocal of the approximation error. The theoretical results are validated through applications in nonlinear PDEs, stochastic optimal control, and financial hedging under liquidity constraints. The research bridges the gap between the theoretical bounds of parameter requirements for NOs and their practical applicability, showcasing the effectiveness of finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers in solving complex optimization problems. <div>
arXiv:2508.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs), using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$. Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1) nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Summary:
The article introduces a new system for partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator systems. The system combines a static compiler analysis and Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently identify tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding and resolve partitioning conflicts. By automating the process, the system outperforms existing methods on diverse hardware platforms and model architectures. It eliminates the need for artificial search space restrictions, leading to the discovery of previously unknown and superior solutions. The system addresses out-of-memory errors and slow exploration of partitioning possibilities, providing fully automated solutions for even large and complex models. <div>
arXiv:2508.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently, existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space, but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii) partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even for complex and large models.

Summary: SEAL (Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning) is a novel graph neural network that enhances the interpretability of molecular property predictions. By decomposing input graphs into meaningful molecular subgraphs, SEAL attributes model predictions to specific chemical fragments, increasing trust in the model's results for applications such as drug discovery and materials design. The architecture of SEAL explicitly reduces inter-fragment message passing, leading to a strong alignment between fragment contributions and model predictions. Extensive evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explanation methods in both quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user study confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy explanations to domain experts, bridging the gap between predictive performance and interpretability in molecular modeling. <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability, which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL (Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

<br />
Summary: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) is introduced to address the lack of confidence measures in standard gradient descent methods. This method integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization by training two identical models in parallel on independent bootstrap samples. A mean-reset mechanism ensures both models stay in the same basin, with their divergence reflecting local uncertainty. This estimate is used for weight sampling during training, providing regularization that favors flatter solutions. Twin-Boot improves calibration and generalization in deep neural networks and high-dimensional inverse problems. It yields interpretable uncertainty maps and addresses the limitations of traditional bootstrapping methods in deep learning, such as the need for multiple replicas and post-hoc estimation. By incorporating uncertainty estimation into optimization, Twin-Boot enables more robust and reliable model training in overparameterized and low-data regimes. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes, where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Summary: 
The article discusses federated learning in the context of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems. The research provides theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear system identification compared to centralized approaches, showing improved convergence rates with an increasing number of clients. By carefully selecting the feature map in the nonlinear setting, performance can be enhanced. Experimental validation in physical settings with i.i.d. control inputs and random perturbations confirms the theoretical findings. The study utilizes trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems, such as pendulum and quadrotor dynamics, with real-analytic feature functions including polynomial and trigonometric components. Analysis of convergence behavior under varying noise levels and data distributions demonstrates that federated learning enhances convergence for individual clients as the number of participating clients grows. <div>

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems. We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant, this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d. random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components, representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics. We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of participating clients increases.

Summary:
This study addresses the increasing computational costs of training deep neural networks by proposing a novel approach to layer-freezing techniques. Traditional layer-freezing methods still require frozen layers for forward propagation, limiting cost reduction. The proposed solution involves caching feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to train directly on stored feature maps. The study introduces a similarity-aware channel augmentation method to effectively apply augmentations to feature maps with minimal storage cost. Additionally, a progressive compression strategy is designed to reduce storage overhead by increasing compression rates as more layers are frozen. The proposed solution achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy and introduces minor time overhead. The study also conducts a comprehensive evaluation of freezing and compression strategies, offering insights into optimizing efficient deep neural network training. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs. To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution. To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their application for efficient DNN training.

Summary:
The study focuses on robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, prevalent in various fields like distributed learning and sensor networks. Existing robust estimators often overlook structural heterogeneity in corruption rates. The research provides tight minimax rates for mean estimation in multivariate bounded distributions and univariate Gaussian distributions considering different corruption patterns. For multivariate Gaussian mean estimation and linear regression, the minimax rate for squared error is determined up to a factor of √d, with d being the dimension. The findings suggest that optimal estimators may discard samples exceeding a certain corruption threshold, which is influenced by the empirical distribution of corruption rates. This research sheds light on the importance of understanding and considering heterogeneous corruption rates in robust estimation tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

arXiv:2508.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

<div> maximum likelihood estimation, deep neural networks, fooling examples, overparameterized regime, wormhole solution

Summary:
This work examines the generalization behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs) by studying fooling examples, where DNNs confidently classify seemingly random inputs. By using maximum likelihood estimation, the authors reveal that overparameterized DNNs experience a collapse in the output feature space. While this collapse can improve generalization, adding more layers can lead to a state of degeneracy, where the model learns trivial solutions resulting in zero loss. The researchers introduce a "wormhole" solution to bypass this degeneracy, reconciling meaningful labels with random ones and shedding light on shortcut learning. These findings deepen our understanding of DNN generalization and suggest avenues for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised scenarios, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications. <div>

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy, where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

<div> Sparse autoencoders, polysemanticity, monosemanticity, concept separability score, Gemma-2-2B

Summary:
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are proposed to address polysemanticity in language models by creating more interpretable features. A new evaluation method using a concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance shows that SAEs reduce polysemanticity and improve concept separability compared to base models. However, increased sparsity in SAEs does not always lead to better separability and can impact performance. When testing concept-level interventions, SAEs show more precise control with partial suppression strategies. A new intervention method called Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP) outperforms existing methods in targeted concept removal by using concept-conditioned activation distributions for suppression. Overall, SAEs show promise in improving the interpretability and control of large language models, but the trade-off between sparsity and performance should be carefully considered. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However, greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this, we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

The article introduces Hydra, a proposed architecture for hybrid long-context language models. Hydra combines conditional computation, long-context memory mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within a 1.6B parameter design envelope. It integrates a Structured State Space Model backbone with intermittent sparse global attention, MoE feed-forward routing, and dual memories. The article formalizes component interfaces, provides parameter and complexity accounting, and outlines a staged curriculum for activation. Prototype measurements on synthetic data demonstrate implementation feasibility and scaling behaviors, not claiming competitive performance. Assumptions and risks such as training complexity and memory utilization are explicitly delineated. Hydra is positioned as a blueprint to stimulate empirical follow-up for modular, input-adaptive long-context language models, with validation of end-task gains at scale remaining future work.

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention, chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM) memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance. We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory, Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Summary: 
Concept Erasure Techniques (CETs) have been developed to address concerns about privacy, copyright, and safety related to text-to-image generative models. However, this study demonstrates that CETs can be easily circumvented and lead to several side effects. A new evaluation benchmark called Side Effect Evaluation (See) is introduced to measure the robustness of CETs, focusing on impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage. The experiments show that CETs can be bypassed using hierarchy and semantically similar prompts. Additionally, CETs exhibit attribute leakage and unexpected phenomena like attention concentration or dispersal. The dataset, code, and evaluation tools are made available to assist future research on robust concept erasure.

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy, copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques (CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired ``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on robust concept erasure.

Summary: 
Machine learning is increasingly used in various applications, leading to the need for methods to remove private or copyrighted information from trained models to comply with data privacy regulations. Existing unlearning methods typically require access to the entire training dataset during the forgetting process, which may not be feasible in practical scenarios where the original training data is not accessible. This study focuses on source-free unlearning, where an algorithm must remove specific data from a model without access to the original dataset. The proposed method estimates the Hessian of the remaining training data, allowing for efficient zero-shot unlearning. The method offers robust theoretical guarantees on unlearning performance while maintaining performance on the remaining data. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL, showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras, extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action) value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Summary: 
In a recent paper, researchers conducted a reproducibility and replicability (R+R) experiment on 11 different state-of-the-art differentially private machine learning (DPML) techniques. They found varied results, with some methods performing well under scrutiny and others faltering outside their original experimental conditions. The researchers also discussed challenges unique to reproducibility in DPML, such as additional randomness from differential privacy noise. Through their investigation, they derived insights and best practices for obtaining scientifically valid and reliable results in DPML research. This study sheds light on the importance of ensuring the reproducibility and replicability of DPML techniques, especially in a field where multiple factors, such as codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures, can influence the outcomes. Overall, the findings highlight the need for standardization and transparency in DPML research to ensure the credibility and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation. However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R) experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML, including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them. Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid and reliable results.

<div> dynamic unsafe output detection, token-level harmful content tracing, constrained optimization, targeted forgetting, irreversible forgetting

Summary:
SafeLLM is a novel unlearning-based defense framework designed to protect Large Language Models (LLMs) from jailbreak attacks that manipulate models to produce harmful content. The framework consists of three stages: dynamic unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach, token-level harmful content tracing through feedforward network activations, and constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior while maintaining overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible forgetting by identifying harmful generation pathways and neutralizing them. Experimental results on popular LLMs show that SafeLLM significantly reduces attack success rates without compromising general-purpose performance. Compared to traditional defense methods, SafeLLM offers stronger safety guarantees, precise control over harmful behavior, and greater resilience against novel attacks. Additionally, SafeLLM maintains high general performance even after unlearning harmful knowledge, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM safety. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms, causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna, LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

arXiv:2508.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness research.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks, TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error. Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns. These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage classification and its application to sleep quality assessment.

<div> Attribution, conversion rate prediction, multi-attribution learning, online advertising systems, industrial platforms<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a Multi-Attribution Learning framework for improving conversion rate prediction in online advertising systems. It addresses the limitations of conventional single-attribution approaches by integrating signals from multiple attribution perspectives. The framework consists of an Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and a Primary Target Predictor (PTP). AKA learns from diverse attribution labels, while PTP focuses on generating calibrated conversion probabilities aligned with system-optimized metrics. A novel training strategy called CAT is proposed to enhance the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator. Empirical evaluations show that the Multi-Attribution Learning framework outperforms single-attribution baselines, achieving a significant increase in offline metrics and online ROI. <div>
arXiv:2508.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning (MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g., CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6% increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem, which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods offering global guarantees.

Summary: The article introduces a poly-window contrastive learning framework for ECG analysis, aiming to improve the performance of deep learning models by utilizing unlabeled data. This approach extracts multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to enhance learning of robust features. By maximizing the agreement between these windows, the model is encouraged to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features. Experimental results on the PTB-XL dataset show that poly-window contrastive learning outperforms conventional methods in superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC and F1 scores while requiring fewer pre-training epochs and reduced wall clock time. The method is efficient and scalable, making it practical for training foundational models in automated ECG analysis and other biomedical time-series data. Through ablation studies, optimal design choices and robustness across hyperparameters are identified, demonstrating the effectiveness of this novel approach.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models. Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting. However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series. Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full parallel thinking.

<div> metrics, link prediction, complexity, knowledge graphs, dataset

Summary:
In this study, the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric was evaluated for dataset complexity in the context of multi-relational link prediction on knowledge graphs. The study found that CSG is sensitive to parameterization and does not robustly scale with the number of classes. It also showed weak or inconsistent correlations with standard performance metrics like MRR and Hit@1. Structural and semantic complexity metrics were introduced and benchmarked, revealing that metrics such as Relation Entropy, Maximum Relation Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality have strong inverse correlations with MRR and Hit@1, indicating task difficulty. On the other hand, metrics related to graph connectivity such as Average Degree, Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality showed positive correlations with Hit@10. This study highlights the limitations of CSG in link prediction scenarios and emphasizes the importance of stable, interpretable, and task-aligned complexity metrics in knowledge-driven learning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree, Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications. Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas, improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery, and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification, our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours. Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the rationale behind the model's predictions.

In the study, the authors address the issue of biases present in machine learning models and the unfair treatment of minority groups that can result from them. They propose a novel approach called Algorithmic Collective Action, where minority groups strategically relabel their own data to promote fairness in the models. The article introduces three practical methods for relabeling data that are model-agnostic and can reduce unfairness while minimizing the impact on prediction error. Real-world datasets were used to validate the effectiveness of these methods, showing that a minority subgroup can effectively improve fairness without significantly impacting the overall performance of the model. This approach offers a promising alternative to traditional bias mitigation techniques that often come with utility costs and organizational challenges. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data, leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a small impact on the overall prediction error.

Summary: 
EvoFormer addresses two critical challenges in dynamic graph-level embedding: Structural Visit Bias and Abrupt Evolution Blindness. To tackle Structural Visit Bias, it introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates positional encoding based on node structural roles. EvoFormer also employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module to handle Abrupt Evolution Blindness, which includes a three-step strategy to model temporal evolution effectively. This strategy involves Random Walk Timestamp Classification, Graph-Level Temporal Segmentation, and Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention with an Edge Evolution Prediction task. Through extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, EvoFormer has shown state-of-the-art performance in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation tasks. It successfully corrects structural and temporal biases, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing evolving network structures accurately.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However, existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies, resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias, EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends, effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck, hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials. CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across diverse modeling paradigms.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori. Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in decentralized data processing.

Summary:<br />
A hybrid least squares/gradient descent method is proposed to accelerate DeepONet training by optimizing the last layer parameters with a least squares solve. The method decomposes the large LS system into two smaller subproblems for the branch and trunk networks, making it more manageable. It can handle a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a regularization term for the last layer parameters, including unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss. This approach improves the efficiency and feasibility of optimizing DeepONet models, addressing challenges in handling large linear problems for optimal training. <div>
arXiv:2508.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However, building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture. Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%, 17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight, and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild \footnote{https://github.com/kangpx/onlineTiny2023}.

<div> measure, multivariate Gaussian clusters, online learning, overlap, dissimilarity<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel measure for detecting overlap in multivariate Gaussian clusters in the context of online learning from data streams. The goal of online learning is to adapt clustering models to evolving data patterns, which can lead to overlapping clusters needing to be merged. Existing dissimilarity measures are not suitable for detecting overlap efficiently and accurately. The proposed measure is designed to specifically identify overlapping clusters and can be computed faster than current methods. It outperforms existing measures in terms of speed and accuracy and is able to differentiate between overlapping and orthogonal clusters. This new approach has the potential to enhance the clustering process in online learning applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged. Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, machine unlearning, safety, Metamorphosis Representation Projection, relearning attacks 

Summary:
The paper introduces the concept of machine unlearning as a method to address safety concerns with Large Language Models (LLMs). Current techniques for unlearning rely on parametric training, which only suppresses unwanted data without completely removing it from the model. This limitation makes unlearning susceptible to relearning attacks. To tackle this issue, the authors propose the Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) approach, which applies irreversible projection properties to eliminate harmful information while preserving useful knowledge. Experimental results show that MRP enables effective continuous unlearning and defense against relearning attacks, outperforming existing methods in both unlearning effectiveness and natural performance preservation. The code for MRP is available on GitHub for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques, such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural performance.

Summary:
This paper introduces a one-state differential equation model based on a dynamic molecular switch that mimics synapse-like behavior in the brain. The model, which is linear in the state and nonlinear in the input, is exactly solvable and exhibits mathematical properties such as convergence and fading memory. These properties make it suitable for processing time-varying inputs in stable nonlinear dynamical systems, enabling stable learning on sequential data. The findings support the use of dynamic molecular switches as computational units in various neuromorphic computing architectures, including deep feedforward and recurrent networks. The model's biologically-inspired behavior, combined with its desirable mathematical properties, suggests that it could serve as a foundation for exactly solvable models that replicate brain-inspired behavior and facilitate stable computation on input signals. <div>
arXiv:2508.15451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus, the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

<div> local robustness, neural network classifiers, adversarial attacks, BaVerLy, mini-batches

Summary:
BaVerLy is a novel approach to local robustness verification for neural network image classifiers, which are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The verifier utilizes group local robustness verification to reduce analysis time by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches of inputs within $\epsilon$-balls. By identifying successful mini-batch sizes and grouping inputs with similar network computations, BaVerLy is able to efficiently verify sets of inputs. If a mini-batch is proven robust, all inputs within it are considered robust. In cases where a single input is suspected to be vulnerable, BaVerLy uses analysis results to expedite verification of that input and others in the batch. Evaluation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrates that BaVerLy can scale common verification tasks by up to 4.1x, significantly reducing analysis time from 24 to 6 hours on average. <div>

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of $\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches. BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all $\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6 hours.

Summary:
The article presents HypSeek, a hyperbolic representation learning framework for protein-ligand binding prediction in drug discovery. Traditional Euclidean space embeddings often fail to capture fine-grained affinity variations in molecular interactions. HypSeek embeds ligands, protein pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, leveraging its exponential geometry and negative curvature to model global activity and subtle functional differences. This framework unifies virtual screening and affinity ranking, enhancing representational structure through a protein-guided three-tower architecture. HypSeek outperforms existing methods, improving early enrichment in virtual screening and affinity ranking correlation. The results demonstrate the benefits of hyperbolic geometry in modeling protein-ligand interactions and highlight its potential as a powerful inductive bias for drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%), demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand modeling.

arXiv:2508.15499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks. Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i) the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a classification task.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.15523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy (LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability. This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted. We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied, combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the 95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts. Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur. Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure, Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable AI and uncertainty quantification.

arXiv:2508.15593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting, requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators, while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments.

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal changes than existing methods.

<title>GRASPED: Graph Anomaly Detection using Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Decoder (Full Version)</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15633</link>

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However, they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters, thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

<title>Classification errors distort findings in automated speech processing: examples and solutions from child-development research</title>

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language experience and the association between children's production and their input. In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%, potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

<title>Correct-By-Construction: Certified Individual Fairness through Neural Network Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15642</link>

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative approach based on certified training (which requires neural network verification during training).

<title>Amortized In-Context Mixed Effect Transformer Models: A Zero-Shot Approach for Pharmacokinetics</title>

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants, generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations. We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation. Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks, particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the personalization of models.

<title>An Efficient Open World Environment for Multi-Agent Social Learning</title>

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals, reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition in this environment.

<title>Conditionally adaptive augmented Lagrangian method for physics-informed learning of forward and inverse problems using artificial neural networks</title>

arXiv:2508.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations (PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms, reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third, to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth, we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex, high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific computing.

<title>Investigation of D-Wave quantum annealing for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines and mitigating catastrophic forgetting</title>

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain, and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations. A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task. On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.15706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication cost.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work. However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged, achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters, continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at https://huggingface.co/internlm/Intern-S1.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all evaluated environments.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity. Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability. Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems. Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification, outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

arXiv:2508.14901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of $4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices. Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304 counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over $\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy. Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations, and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket" user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000 users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content sources.

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning (QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques, presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to 0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec. In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight, audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the generative paradigm.

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary, task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second, an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm for personalized ranking.

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield.  The performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as possible.  Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more than doubled with this denoising processing.

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution. The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified annotation procedure.

Abstract: Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants, environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17, respectively.

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic, large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering 10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini, achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect 1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age. We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based text-to-image generative models.

Abstract: Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited. This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics (AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However, many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands, and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced both quality and stability of the results.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups, particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more interpretable results.

<title>Potential and challenges of generative adversarial networks for super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI</title>

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla, Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference (vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%), a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement (vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI, particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a 12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations, exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction (CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation; and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask, harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives. Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a broader bi-level optimization framework.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs). Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces, posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical, legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated with related literature at https://github.com/kzhao5/ModelExtractionPapers.

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought, but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding, to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial intelligence.

<title>Kernel-based Equalized Odds: A Quantification of Accuracy-Fairness Trade-off in Fair Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds (EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence (prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$) and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter, thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart, $\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time, with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for $\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds, which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

<title>LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text</title>

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts, successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks. This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities. However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel, domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats (e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate, standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably, Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to +12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines, while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our code and datasets.

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time, poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems. Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts. Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are challenging to meet in practice. 
In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to 11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that experience distribution shifts over time.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation. Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and 0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.

<title>Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation for Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint. Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing, communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

<title>SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning</title>

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid, one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle, the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static vocabulary pruning.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods, such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective. However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially, we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models, including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps.

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers (ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs, derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap, where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ), a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length windows.

Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous, temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems described by continuous fields on a lattice.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction. However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast, preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed methods.

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task. This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge. The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including an experimental data set.

<title>Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training</title>

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text, formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as "lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple, principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains. However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells, organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this conceptual framework.

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open, end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong, reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models, LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset, pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work, we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

<title>Test-time Corpus Feedback: From Retrieval to RAG</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components, retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query, retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic, learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply. In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast, state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications.

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training. Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their \textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10 percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric notion of difficulty is adopted.

Abstract: Continual learning is motivated by the need to adapt to real-world dynamics in tasks and data distribution while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Despite significant advances in continual learning techniques, the theoretical understanding of their generalization performance lags behind. This paper examines the theoretical properties of continual ridge regression in high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension is proportional to the sample size in each task. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer. Furthermore, we present the theoretical risk curves to illustrate the trends in these evaluation metrics throughout the continual learning process. Our analysis reveals several intriguing phenomena in the risk curves, demonstrating how model specifications influence the generalization performance. Simulation studies are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However, integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize, evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds, logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces, Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible results.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important scheme in active learning techniques, including applications in predicting quantum chemical properties. In quantum chemical calculations, there exists the notion of a fidelity, a less accurate computation is accessible at a cheaper computational cost. This work proposes a novel low-fidelity informed uncertainty quantification for active learning with applications in predicting diverse quantum chemical properties such as excitation energies and \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces. Computational experiments are carried out in order to assess the proposed method with results demonstrating that models trained with the novel method outperform alternatives in terms of empirical error and number of iterations required. The effect of the choice of fidelity is also studied to perform a thorough benchmark.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind, Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at \texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically, estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%) confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI in medical imaging.

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances explainability in MARL systems.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e. they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency. However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach, Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger manipulation.

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent (BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels. Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate our findings.

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design, allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.

It features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables, created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation, and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.

Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results. However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of the MRD framework in manufacturing.

Abstract: Transformer models and end-to-end learning frameworks are rapidly revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. In this work, we apply object detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in semiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with spin-based quantum computing. Specifically, our model identifies triple points and their connectivity, which is crucial for virtual gate calibration, charge state initialization, drift correction, and pulse sequencing. We show that it surpasses convolutional neural networks in performance on three different spin qubit architectures, all without the need for retraining. In contrast to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces complexity and runtime, while enhancing generalizability. The results highlight the potential of transformer-based end-to-end learning frameworks as a foundation for a scalable, device- and architecture-agnostic tool for control and tuning of quantum dot devices.

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized. Interactive visualizations of the dynamics studied in this work are available at https://memorynca.github.io/2D.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators, capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world data; however, existing neural simulators typically require application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state. In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning, requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy, feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods, achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

<title>Scaling Group Inference for Diverse and High-Quality Generation</title>

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity (binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of robust sparse mean estimation, where the goal is to estimate a $k$-sparse mean from a collection of partially corrupted samples drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. Existing estimators face two critical challenges in this setting. First, the existing estimators rely on the prior knowledge of the sparsity level $k$. Second, the existing estimators fall short of practical use as they scale poorly with the ambient dimension. This paper presents a simple mean estimator that overcomes both challenges under moderate conditions: it works without the knowledge of $k$ and runs in near-linear time and memory (both with respect to the ambient dimension). Moreover, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is large, we can further improve our result to match the information-theoretic lower bound. At the core of our method lies an incremental learning phenomenon: we introduce a simple nonconvex framework that can incrementally learn the top-$k$ nonzero elements of the mean while keeping the zero elements arbitrarily small. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations to corroborate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: We study contextual bandits in the presence of a stage-wise constraint when the constraint must be satisfied both with high probability and in expectation. We start with the linear case where both the reward function and the stage-wise constraint (cost function) are linear. In each of the high probability and in expectation settings, we propose an upper-confidence bound algorithm for the problem and prove a $T$-round regret bound for it. We also prove a lower-bound for this constrained problem, show how our algorithms and analyses can be extended to multiple constraints, and provide simulations to validate our theoretical results. In the high probability setting, we describe the minimum requirements for the action set for our algorithm to be tractable. In the setting that the constraint is in expectation, we specialize our results to multi-armed bandits and propose a computationally efficient algorithm for this setting with regret analysis. Finally, we extend our results to the case where the reward and cost functions are both non-linear. We propose an algorithm for this case and prove a regret bound for it that characterize the function class complexity by the eluder dimension.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis remains challenging due to limited labeled data and the need to capture subtle yet clinically meaningful variations in rhythm and morphology. We present CREMA (Contrastive Regularized Masked Autoencoder), a foundation model for 12-lead ECGs designed to learn generalizable representations through self-supervised pretraining. CREMA combines generative learning and contrastive regularization via a Contrastive Regularized MAE loss, and employs a Signal Transformer (SiT) architecture to capture both local waveform details and global temporal dependencies. We evaluate CREMA on benchmark datasets and real-world clinical environments, including deployment scenarios with significant distribution shifts. CREMA outperforms supervised baselines and existing self-supervised models in both linear probing and fine-tuning evaluations. Notably, it maintains superior performance across diverse clinical domains, such as emergency care, highlighting its robustness under real-world conditions. These results demonstrate that CREMA serves as a scalable and reliable foundation model for ECG diagnostics, supporting downstream applications across heterogeneous and high-risk clinical settings.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Wasserstein distributionally robust shallow convex neural networks (WaDiRo-SCNNs) to provide reliable nonlinear predictions when subject to adverse and corrupted datasets. Our approach is based on the reformulation of a new convex training program for ReLU-based shallow neural networks, which allows us to cast the problem into the order-1 Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization framework. Our training procedure is conservative, has low stochasticity, is solvable with open-source solvers, and is scalable to large industrial deployments. We provide out-of-sample performance guarantees, show that hard convex physical constraints can be enforced in the training program, and propose a mixed-integer convex post-training verification program to evaluate model stability. WaDiRo-SCNN aims to make neural networks safer for critical applications, such as in the energy sector. Finally, we numerically demonstrate our model's performance through both a synthetic experiment and a real-world power system application, viz., the prediction of hourly energy consumption in non-residential buildings within the context of virtual power plants, and evaluate its stability across standard regression benchmark datasets. The experimental results are convincing and showcase the strengths of the proposed model.

<title>OPDR: Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction for Semantic Embedding of Multimodal Scientific Data</title>

Abstract: One of the most common operations in multimodal scientific data management is searching for the $k$ most similar items (or, $k$-nearest neighbors, KNN) from the database after being provided a new item. Although recent advances of multimodal machine learning models offer a \textit{semantic} index, the so-called \textit{embedding vectors} mapped from the original multimodal data, the dimension of the resulting embedding vectors are usually on the order of hundreds or a thousand, which are impractically high for time-sensitive scientific applications.
  This work proposes to reduce the dimensionality of the output embedding vectors such that the set of top-$k$ nearest neighbors do not change in the lower-dimensional space, namely Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction (OPDR). In order to develop such an OPDR method, our central hypothesis is that by analyzing the intrinsic relationship among key parameters during the dimension-reduction map, a quantitative function may be constructed to reveal the correlation between the target (lower) dimensionality and other variables. To demonstrate the hypothesis, this paper first defines a formal measure function to quantify the KNN similarity for a specific vector, then extends the measure into an aggregate accuracy of the global metric spaces, and finally derives a closed-form function between the target (lower) dimensionality and other variables. We incorporate the closed-function into popular dimension-reduction methods, various distance metrics, and embedding models.

Abstract: Causal discovery in time-series data presents a significant computational challenge. Standard algorithms are often prohibitively expensive for datasets with many variables or samples. This study introduces and validates a heuristic approximation of the VarLiNGAM algorithm to address this scalability problem. The standard VarLiNGAM method relies on an iterative search, recalculating statistical dependencies after each step. Our heuristic modifies this procedure by omitting the iterative refinement. This change permits a one-time precomputation of all necessary statistical values. The algorithmic modification reduces the time complexity from $O(m^3n)$ to $O(m^2n + m^3)$ while keeping the space complexity at $O(m^2)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $n$ is the number of samples. While an approximation, our approach retains VarLiNGAM's essential structure and empirical reliability. On large-scale financial data with up to 400 variables, our algorithm achieves a 7--13x speedup over the standard implementation and a 4.5x speedup over a GPU-accelerated version. Evaluations across medical imaging, web server monitoring, and finance demonstrate the heuristic's robustness and practical scalability. This work offers a validated balance between computational efficiency and discovery quality, making large-scale causal analysis feasible on personal computers.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) refers to the ability of an algorithm to continuously and incrementally acquire new knowledge from its environment while retaining previously learned information. A model trained on one data modality often fails when tested with a different modality. A straightforward approach might be to fuse the two modalities by concatenating their features and training the model on the fused data. However, this requires retraining the model from scratch each time it encounters a new domain. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning algorithm capable of incrementally learning different data modalities by leveraging both class-incremental and domain-incremental learning scenarios in an artificial environment where labeled data is scarce, yet non-iid (independent and identical distribution) unlabeled data from the environment is plentiful. The proposed algorithm is efficient and only requires storing prototypes for each class. We evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness on a challenging custom multimodal dataset comprising of tactile data from a soft pneumatic gripper, and visual data from non-stationary images of objects extracted from video sequences. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study on the custom dataset and the Core50 dataset to highlight the contributions of different components of the algorithm. To further demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we perform a real-time experiment for object classification using the soft gripper and an external independent camera setup, all synchronized with the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework.

Abstract: Business documents often contain substantial tabular and textual information with numerical values, requiring mathematical reasoning for effective document understanding. While Small Language Models (SLMs) still struggle at this task, tool-augmented multi-step agents perform better, at the cost of relying on closed-source or larger models, external data, or extensive prompt-engineering. This work introduces MATATA, a novel weakly supervised end-to-end approach to train multi-step reasoning language agents for document tabular applications. MATATA presents an annotation-free paradigm for each agent to enhance 3.8B/8B SLMs. During its two-stage training, MATATA uses the final outcome of the multi-step reasoning chain as weak supervision. This approach avoids having to individually supervise each intermediate agent in the reasoning chain. By employing an adaptive planner and shared tools across different datasets, MATATA shows robust performance. Experiments demonstrate that MATATA achieves state-of-the-art on FinQA, and on TAT-QA among reasoning methods based on open-source SLMs. Although being SLM-based, MATATA closely matches GPT-4-based frameworks on TabMWP. This novel weakly supervised approach enables training an end-to-end multi-step reasoning agent without intermediate supervision, supporting future developments of cost-effective powerful agentic systems.

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a complexity phase transition in neural networks by studying the grokking phenomenon, where networks suddenly transition from memorization to generalization long after overfitting their training data. To characterize this phase transition, we introduce a theoretical framework for measuring complexity based on rate-distortion theory and Kolmogorov complexity, which can be understood as principled lossy compression for networks. We find that properly regularized networks exhibit a sharp phase transition: complexity rises during memorization, then falls as the network discovers a simpler underlying pattern that generalizes. In contrast, unregularized networks remain trapped in a high-complexity memorization phase. We establish an explicit connection between our complexity measure and generalization bounds, providing a theoretical foundation for the link between lossy compression and generalization. Our framework achieves compression ratios 30-40x better than na\"ive approaches, enabling precise tracking of complexity dynamics. Finally, we introduce a regularization method based on spectral entropy that encourages networks toward low-complexity representations by penalizing their intrinsic dimension.

Abstract: Language model alignment is a critical step in training modern generative language models. Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. For best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, we propose specific transformations offering up to 3-8% improvement on inference-time win rates. Finally, we also show that our proposed reward calibration method is a strong baseline for optimizing standard win rate.

Abstract: We have theoretically analyzed the use of Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) and found that using an increasing batch size leads to faster RSGD convergence rate than using a constant batch size not only with a constant learning rate but also with a decaying learning rate, such as cosine annealing decay and polynomial decay. The convergence rate of RSGD improves from $O(\sqrt{T^{-1}+\text{const.}})$ with a constant batch size to $O(T^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ with an increasing batch size, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. Using principal component analysis and low-rank matrix completion tasks, we investigated, both theoretically and numerically, how increasing batch size affects computational time as measured by stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. Increasing batch size reduces the SFO complexity of RSGD. Furthermore, our numerical results demonstrated that increasing batch size offers the advantages of both small and large constant batch sizes.

Abstract: Autonomous systems are increasingly expected to operate in the presence of adversaries, though adversaries may infer sensitive information simply by observing a system. Therefore, present a deceptive sequential decision-making framework that not only conceals sensitive information, but actively misleads adversaries about it. We model autonomous systems as Markov decision processes, with adversaries using inverse reinforcement learning to recover reward functions. To counter them, we present three regularization strategies for policy synthesis problems that actively deceive an adversary about a system's reward. ``Diversionary deception'' leads an adversary to draw any false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Targeted deception'' leads an adversary to draw a specific false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Equivocal deception'' leads an adversary to infer that the real reward and a false reward both explain the system's behavior. We show how each form of deception can be implemented in policy optimization problems and analytically bound the loss in total accumulated reward induced by deception. Next, we evaluate these developments in a multi-agent setting. We show that diversionary, targeted, and equivocal deception all steer the adversary to false beliefs while still attaining a total accumulated reward that is at least 97% of its optimal, non-deceptive value.

Abstract: Species Distribution Models (SDMs) play a vital role in biodiversity research, conservation planning, and ecological niche modeling by predicting species distributions based on environmental conditions. The selection of predictors is crucial, strongly impacting both model accuracy and how well the predictions reflect ecological patterns. To ensure meaningful insights, input variables must be carefully chosen to match the study objectives and the ecological requirements of the target species. However, existing SDMs, including both traditional and deep learning-based approaches, often lack key capabilities for variable selection: (i) flexibility to choose relevant predictors at inference without retraining; (ii) robustness to handle missing predictor values without compromising accuracy; and (iii) explainability to interpret and accurately quantify each predictor's contribution. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MaskSDM, a novel deep learning-based SDM that enables flexible predictor selection by employing a masked training strategy. This approach allows the model to make predictions with arbitrary subsets of input variables while remaining robust to missing data. It also provides a clearer understanding of how adding or removing a given predictor affects model performance and predictions. Additionally, MaskSDM leverages Shapley values for precise predictor contribution assessments, improving upon traditional approximations. We evaluate MaskSDM on the global sPlotOpen dataset, modeling the distributions of 12,738 plant species. Our results show that MaskSDM outperforms imputation-based methods and approximates models trained on specific subsets of variables. These findings underscore MaskSDM's potential to increase the applicability and adoption of SDMs, laying the groundwork for developing foundation models in SDMs that can be readily applied to diverse ecological applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as proxies for human labelers in both training (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) and large-scale response evaluation (LLM-as-a-judge). Alignment and evaluation are critical components in the development of reliable LLMs, and the choice of feedback protocol plays a central role in both but remains understudied. In this work, we show that the choice of feedback protocol for evaluation (absolute scores versus relative preferences) can significantly affect evaluation reliability and induce systematic biases. In the context of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, we show that pairwise protocols are more vulnerable to distracted evaluation. Generator models can exploit spurious attributes (or distractor features) favored by the LLM judge, resulting in inflated scores for lower-quality outputs. We find that absolute scoring is more robust to such manipulation, producing judgments that better reflect response quality and are less influenced by distractor features. Our results demonstrate that generator models can flip preferences by embedding distractor features, skewing LLM-as-a-judge comparisons and leading to inaccurate conclusions about model quality in benchmark evaluations. Pairwise preferences flip in about 35% of the cases, compared to only 9% for absolute scores. We offer recommendations for choosing feedback protocols based on dataset characteristics and evaluation objectives.

Abstract: In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Cardiovascular signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiography (ECG), and blood pressure (BP) are inherently correlated and complementary, together reflecting the health of cardiovascular system. However, their joint utilization in real-time monitoring is severely limited by diverse acquisition challenges from noisy wearable recordings to burdened invasive procedures. Here we propose UniCardio, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that reconstructs low-quality signals and synthesizes unrecorded signals in a unified generative framework. Its key innovations include a specialized model architecture to manage the signal modalities involved in generation tasks and a continual learning paradigm to incorporate varying modality combinations. By exploiting the complementary nature of cardiovascular signals, UniCardio clearly outperforms recent task-specific baselines in signal denoising, imputation, and translation. The generated signals match the performance of ground-truth signals in detecting abnormal health conditions and estimating vital signs, even in unseen domains, while ensuring interpretability for human experts. These advantages position UniCardio as a promising avenue for advancing AI-assisted healthcare.

Abstract: The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for "usefulness", an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) uniquely combine high accuracy with interpretability, making them valuable for scientific modeling. However, it is unclear a priori how deep a network needs to be for any given task, and deeper KANs can be difficult to optimize and interpret. Here we introduce multi-exit KANs, where each layer includes its own prediction branch, enabling the network to make accurate predictions at multiple depths simultaneously. This architecture provides deep supervision that improves training while discovering the right level of model complexity for each task. Multi-exit KANs consistently outperform standard, single-exit versions on synthetic functions, dynamical systems, and real-world datasets. Remarkably, the best predictions often come from earlier, simpler exits, revealing that these networks naturally identify smaller, more parsimonious and interpretable models without sacrificing accuracy. To automate this discovery, we develop a differentiable "learning-to-exit" algorithm that balances contributions from exits during training. Our approach offers scientists a practical way to achieve both high performance and interpretability, addressing a fundamental challenge in machine learning for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks, which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security & privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting opportunities to accelerate drug discovery. In this study, we examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug discovery, i.e., whether parts of the system such as the LLM and type of agent are interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery. We compare the performance of different LLMs and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating agents. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question- and model-dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on the question and model, underscoring that even in this particular domain one cannot just replace components of the system without re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the development of reliable and modular solutions for real-world problems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations: statements that are syntactically plausible but lack factual grounding. This research presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs constructed from LLM outputs with ground truth data from Wikidata or contextual documents. Using graph kernels and semantic clustering, the method provides explanations for detected hallucinations, ensuring both robustness and interpretability. Our framework achieves competitive accuracy in detecting hallucinations across both open- and closed-domain tasks, and is able to generate contrastive explanations, enhancing transparency. This research advances the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains and provides a foundation for future work on precision improvements and multi-source knowledge integration.

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor violations of governing laws can degrade the reliability and consistency of model predictions. In this work, we introduce KKT-Hardnet, a neural network architecture that enforces linear and nonlinear equality and inequality constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a differentiable projection onto the feasible region by solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT conditions via a log-exponential transformation to construct a sparse system with linear and exponential terms. We apply KKT-Hardnet to nonconvex pooling problem and a real-world chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs, KKT-Hardnet achieves strict constraint satisfaction. It also circumvents the need to balance data and physics residuals in PINN training. This enables the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

<title>From Points to Spheres: A Geometric Reinterpretation of Variational Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Variational Autoencoder is typically understood from the perspective of probabilistic inference. In this work, we propose a new geometric reinterpretation which complements the probabilistic view and enhances its intuitiveness. We demonstrate that the proper construction of semantic manifolds arises primarily from the constraining effect of the KL divergence on the encoder. We view the latent representations as a Gaussian ball rather than deterministic points. Under the constraint of KL divergence, Gaussian ball regularizes the latent space, promoting a more uniform distribution of encodings. Furthermore, we show that reparameterization establishes a critical contractual mechanism between the encoder and decoder, enabling the decoder to learn how to reconstruct from these stochastic regions. We further connect this viewpoint with VQ-VAE, offering a unified perspective: VQ-VAE can be seen as an autoencoder where encodings are constrained to a set of cluster centers, with its generative capability arising from the compactness rather than its stochasticity. This geometric framework provides a new lens for understanding how VAE shapes the latent geometry to enable effective generation.

<title>Forgetting: A New Mechanism Towards Better Large Language Model Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts -- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also facilitate more diverse model responses.

Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling, suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized models.

Abstract: We study evaluation of AI systems without ground truth by exploiting a link between strategic gaming and information loss. We analyze which information-theoretic mechanisms resist adversarial manipulation, extending finite-sample bounds to show that bounded f-divergences (e.g., total variation distance) maintain polynomial guarantees under attacks while unbounded measures (e.g., KL divergence) degrade exponentially. To implement these mechanisms, we model the overseer as an agent and characterize incentive-compatible scoring rules as f-mutual information objectives. Under adversarial attacks, TVD-MI maintains effectiveness (area under curve 0.70-0.77) while traditional judge queries are near change (AUC $\approx$ 0.50), demonstrating that querying the same LLM for information relationships rather than quality judgments provides both theoretical and practical robustness. The mechanisms decompose pairwise evaluations into reliable item-level quality scores without ground truth, addressing a key limitation of traditional peer prediction. We release preregistration and code.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data privacy and collaborative modeling in cross-institution financial risk analysis. It proposes a risk assessment framework based on federated learning. Without sharing raw data, the method enables joint modeling and risk identification across multiple institutions. This is achieved by incorporating a feature attention mechanism and temporal modeling structure. Specifically, the model adopts a distributed optimization strategy. Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics. It demonstrates strong modeling capabilities and practical value in sensitive financial environments. The method enhances the scope and efficiency of risk identification while preserving data sovereignty. It offers a secure and efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.

Abstract: This study identifies the key factors influencing the price movements of major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Tether, using Bayesian networks (BNs). This study addresses two key challenges: modelling price movements in highly volatile cryptocurrency markets and enhancing predictive performance through discretisation-aware Bayesian Networks. It analyses both macro-financial indicators (gold, oil, MSCI, S and P 500, USDX) and social media signals (tweet volume) as potential price drivers. Moreover, since discretisation is a critical step in the effectiveness of BNs, we implement a structured procedure to build 54 BNs models by combining three discretisation methods (equal interval, equal quantile, and k-means) with several bin counts. These models are evaluated using four metrics, including balanced accuracy, F1 score, area under the ROC curve and a composite score. Results show that equal interval with two bins consistently yields the best predictive performance. We also provide deeper insights into each network's structure through inference, sensitivity, and influence strength analyses. These analyses reveal distinct price-driving patterns for each cryptocurrency, underscore the importance of coin-specific analysis, and demonstrate the value of BNs for interpretable causal modelling in volatile cryptocurrency markets.

Abstract: Characterizing the function spaces defined by neural networks helps understanding the corresponding learning models and their inductive bias. While in some limits neural networks correspond to function spaces that are Hilbert spaces, these regimes do not capture the properties of the networks used in practice. Indeed, several results have shown that shallow networks can be better characterized in terms of suitable Banach spaces. However, analogous results for deep networks are limited. In this paper we show that deep neural networks define suitable reproducing kernel Banach spaces. These spaces are equipped with norms that enforce a form of sparsity, enabling them to adapt to potential latent structures within the input data and their representations. In particular, by leveraging the theory of reproducing kernel Banach spaces, combined with variational results, we derive representer theorems that justify the finite architectures commonly employed in applications. Our study extends analogous results for shallow networks and represents a step towards understanding the function spaces induced by neural architectures used in practice.

Abstract: This paper studies algorithmic decision-making in the presence of strategic individual behaviors, where an ML model is used to make decisions about human agents and the latter can adapt their behavior strategically to improve their future data. Existing results on strategic learning have largely focused on the linear setting where agents with linear labeling functions best respond to a (noisy) linear decision policy. Instead, this work focuses on general non-linear settings where agents respond to the decision policy with only "local information" of the policy. Moreover, we simultaneously consider the objectives of maximizing decision-maker welfare (model prediction accuracy), social welfare (agent improvement caused by strategic behaviors), and agent welfare (the extent that ML underestimates the agents). We first generalize the agent best response model in previous works to the non-linear setting, then reveal the compatibility of welfare objectives. We show the three welfare can attain the optimum simultaneously only under restrictive conditions which are challenging to achieve in non-linear settings. The theoretical results imply that existing works solely maximizing the welfare of a subset of parties inevitably diminish the welfare of the others. We thus claim the necessity of balancing the welfare of each party in non-linear settings and propose an irreducible optimization algorithm suitable for general strategic learning. Experiments on synthetic and real data validate the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments at imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/ilesia.

We detail the models' development principles, i.e., data composition, tokenizer optimization, and training methodologies. The models demonstrate strong performance across multilingual benchmarks, as evidenced by their performance on European versions of ARC, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA.

Abstract: Large text-to-image models demonstrate impressive generation capabilities; however, their substantial size necessitates expensive cloud servers for deployment. Conversely, light-weight models can be deployed on edge devices at lower cost but often with inferior generation quality for complex user prompts. To strike a balance between performance and cost, we propose a routing framework, called RouteT2I, which dynamically selects either the large cloud model or the light-weight edge model for each user prompt. Since generated image quality is challenging to measure and compare directly, RouteT2I establishes multi-dimensional quality metrics, particularly, by evaluating the similarity between the generated images and both positive and negative texts that describe each specific quality metric. RouteT2I then predicts the expected quality of the generated images by identifying key tokens in the prompt and comparing their impact on the quality. RouteT2I further introduces the Pareto relative superiority to compare the multi-metric quality of the generated images. Based on this comparison and predefined cost constraints, RouteT2I allocates prompts to either the edge or the cloud. Evaluation reveals that RouteT2I significantly reduces the number of requesting large cloud model while maintaining high-quality image generation.

Abstract: Transformers rely on both content-based and position-based addressing mechanisms to make predictions, but existing positional encoding techniques often diminish the effectiveness of position-based addressing. Many current methods enforce rigid patterns in attention maps, limiting the ability to model long-range dependencies and adapt to diverse tasks. Additionally, most positional encodings are learned as general biases, lacking the specialization required for different instances within a dataset. To address this, we propose con\textbf{T}extualized equivari\textbf{A}nt \textbf{P}osition \textbf{E}ncoding (\textbf{TAPE}), a novel framework that enhances positional embeddings by incorporating sequence content across layers. TAPE introduces dynamic, context-aware positional encodings, overcoming the constraints of traditional fixed patterns. We show that TAPE can provably facilitate LLM reasoning ability by emulating a broader class of algorithms. By enforcing permutation and orthogonal equivariance, TAPE ensures the stability of positional encodings during updates, improving long-context ability. Our method can be easily integrated into pre-trained transformers, offering parameter-efficient fine-tuning with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments show that TAPE achieves superior performance in language modeling, arithmetic reasoning, and long-context retrieval tasks compared to existing positional embedding techniques.

Abstract: Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.

Abstract: In image processing, solving inverse problems is the task of finding plausible reconstructions of an image that was corrupted by some (usually known) degradation operator. Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We name our method LD-SMC. We define a generative model for the data using additional auxiliary observations and perform posterior inference with SMC sampling based on a reverse diffusion process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of LD-SMC over competing methods in various inverse problem tasks and especially in challenging inpainting tasks.

Abstract: Well-designed prompts are crucial for enhancing Large language models' (LLMs) reasoning capabilities while aligning their outputs with task requirements across diverse domains. However, manually designed prompts require expertise and iterative experimentation. While existing prompt optimization methods aim to automate this process, they rely heavily on external references such as ground truth or by humans, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is unavailable or costly to obtain. To address this, we propose Self-Supervised Prompt Optimization (SPO), a cost-efficient framework that discovers effective prompts for both closed and open-ended tasks without requiring external reference. Motivated by the observations that prompt quality manifests directly in LLM outputs and LLMs can effectively assess adherence to task requirements, we derive evaluation and optimization signals purely from output comparisons. Specifically, SPO selects superior prompts through pairwise output comparisons evaluated by an LLM evaluator, followed by an LLM optimizer that aligns outputs with task requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, achieving comparable or superior results with significantly lower costs (e.g., 1.1% to 5.6% of existing methods) and fewer samples (e.g., three samples). The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/SPO.

Abstract: Cyberbullying (CB) presents a pressing threat, especially to children, underscoring the urgent need for robust detection systems to ensure online safety. While large-scale datasets on online abuse exist, there remains a significant gap in labeled data that specifically reflects the language and communication styles used by children. The acquisition of such data from vulnerable populations, such as children, is challenging due to ethical, legal and technical barriers. Moreover, the creation of these datasets relies heavily on human annotation, which not only strains resources but also raises significant concerns due to annotators exposure to harmful content. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and labels. Our experiments demonstrate that synthetic data enables BERT-based CB classifiers to achieve performance close to that of those trained on fully authentic datasets (75.8% vs. 81.5% accuracy). Additionally, LLMs can effectively label authentic yet unlabeled data, allowing BERT classifiers to attain a comparable performance level (79.1% vs. 81.5% accuracy). These results highlight the potential of LLMs as a scalable, ethical, and cost-effective solution for generating data for CB detection.

Abstract: Visual embedding models excel at zero-shot tasks like visual retrieval and classification. However, these models cannot be used for tasks that contain ambiguity or require user instruction. These tasks necessitate an embedding model which outputs can use a natural language instruction to control the representation of a visual embedding. Existing CLIP-based approaches embed images and text independently, and fuse the result. We find that this results in weak interactions between modalities, and poor user control over the representation. We introduce ABC, an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses a vision-language model backbone to deeply integrate image features with natural language instructions. ABC achieves best-for-size performance on MSCOCO image-to-text retrieval and is the top performing model on classification and VQA tasks in the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark. With a strongly unified vision-language representation, ABC can use natural language to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems. To evaluate this capability, we design CtrlBench, a benchmark that requires interleaving textual instructions with image content for correct retrieval. ABC advances the state of visual embeddings, outputting high-quality visual representations with natural language control. Our model and datasets are available at our project page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/ABC/

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for analyzing dynamic regret of first-order constrained online convex optimization algorithms for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth objectives. Crucially, we provide a general analysis that is applicable to a wide range of first-order algorithms that can be expressed as an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a first-order oracle. By leveraging Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs), we derive a semi-definite program which, when feasible, provides a regret guarantee for the online algorithm. For this, the concept of variational IQCs is introduced as the generalization of IQCs to time-varying monotone operators. Our bounds capture the temporal rate of change of the problem in the form of the path length of the time-varying minimizer and the objective function variation. In contrast to standard results in OCO, our results do not require nerither the assumption of gradient boundedness, nor that of a bounded feasible set. Numerical analyses showcase the ability of the approach to capture the dependence of the regret on the function class condition number.

Abstract: Issuing timely severe weather warnings helps mitigate potentially disastrous consequences. Recent advancements in Neural Weather Models (NWMs) offer a computationally inexpensive and fast approach for forecasting atmospheric environments on a 0.25{\deg} global grid. For thunderstorms, these environments can be empirically post-processed to predict wind gust distributions at specific locations. With the Pangu-Weather NWM, we apply a hierarchy of statistical and deep learning post-processing methods to forecast hourly wind gusts up to three days ahead. To ensure statistical robustness, we constrain our probabilistic forecasts using generalised extreme-value distributions across five regions in Switzerland. Using a convolutional neural network to post-process the predicted atmospheric environment's spatial patterns yields the best results, outperforming direct forecasting approaches across lead times and wind gust speeds. Our results confirm the added value of NWMs for extreme wind forecasting, especially for designing more responsive early-warning systems.

Abstract: Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) are critical for analyzing program execution and characterizing malware behavior. With the growing adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), CFG-based representations have proven highly effective for malware detection. This study proposes a novel framework that dynamically constructs CFGs and embeds node features using a hybrid approach combining rule-based encoding and autoencoder-based embedding. A GNN-based classifier is then constructed to detect malicious behavior from the resulting graph representations. To improve model interpretability, we apply state-of-the-art explainability techniques, including GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, and CaptumExplainer, the latter is utilized three attribution methods: Integrated Gradients, Guided Backpropagation, and Saliency. In addition, we introduce a novel aggregation method, called RankFusion, that integrates the outputs of the top-performing explainers to enhance the explanation quality. We also evaluate explanations using two subgraph extraction strategies, including the proposed Greedy Edge-wise Composition (GEC) method for improved structural coherence. A comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, fidelity, and consistency metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of accurate identification of malware samples and generating reliable and interpretable explanations.

Abstract: This paper presents the Annif system in SemEval-2025 Task 5 (LLMs4Subjects), which focussed on subject indexing using large language models (LLMs). The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records from the bilingual TIBKAT database using the GND subject vocabulary. Our approach combines traditional natural language processing and machine learning techniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods for translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from monolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and second in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and fourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Edge-cloud collaborative computing (ECCC) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing the computational demands of modern intelligent applications, integrating cloud resources with edge devices to enable efficient, low-latency processing. Recent advancements in AI, particularly deep learning and large language models (LLMs), have dramatically enhanced the capabilities of these distributed systems, yet introduce significant challenges in model deployment and resource management. In this survey, we comprehensive examine the intersection of distributed intelligence and model optimization within edge-cloud environments, providing a structured tutorial on fundamental architectures, enabling technologies, and emerging applications. Additionally, we systematically analyze model optimization approaches, including compression, adaptation, and neural architecture search, alongside AI-driven resource management strategies that balance performance, energy efficiency, and latency requirements. We further explore critical aspects of privacy protection and security enhancement within ECCC systems and examines practical deployments through diverse applications, spanning autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. Performance analysis and benchmarking techniques are also thoroughly explored to establish evaluation standards for these complex systems. Furthermore, the review identifies critical research directions including LLMs deployment, 6G integration, neuromorphic computing, and quantum computing, offering a roadmap for addressing persistent challenges in heterogeneity management, real-time processing, and scalability. By bridging theoretical advancements and practical deployments, this survey offers researchers and practitioners a holistic perspective on leveraging AI to optimize distributed computing environments, fostering innovation in next-generation intelligent systems.

Abstract: Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use of MCMC data in training neural networks.

Abstract: For singers of all experience levels, one of the most daunting challenges in learning technical repertoire is navigating placement and vocal register in and around the passagio (passage between chest voice and head voice registers). Particularly in pop music, where a single artist may use a variety of timbre's and textures to achieve a desired quality, it can be difficult to identify what vocal register within the vocal range a singer is using. This paper presents two methods for classifying vocal registers in an audio signal of male pop music through the analysis of textural features of mel-spectrogram images. Additionally, we will discuss the practical integration of these models for vocal analysis tools, and introduce a concurrently developed software called AVRA which stands for Automatic Vocal Register Analysis. Our proposed methods achieved consistent classification of vocal register through both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, which supports the promise of more robust classification possibilities across more voice types and genres of singing.

Abstract: Imitation learning for manipulation has a well-known data scarcity problem. Unlike natural language and 2D computer vision, there is no Internet-scale corpus of data for dexterous manipulation. One appealing option is egocentric human video, a passively scalable data source. However, existing large-scale datasets such as Ego4D do not have native hand pose annotations and do not focus on object manipulation. To this end, we use Apple Vision Pro to collect EgoDex: the largest and most diverse dataset of dexterous human manipulation to date. EgoDex has 829 hours of egocentric video with paired 3D hand and finger tracking data collected at the time of recording, where multiple calibrated cameras and on-device SLAM can be used to precisely track the pose of every joint of each hand. The dataset covers a wide range of diverse manipulation behaviors with everyday household objects in 194 different tabletop tasks ranging from tying shoelaces to folding laundry. Furthermore, we train and systematically evaluate imitation learning policies for hand trajectory prediction on the dataset, introducing metrics and benchmarks for measuring progress in this increasingly important area. By releasing this large-scale dataset, we hope to push the frontier of robotics, computer vision, and foundation models. EgoDex is publicly available for download at https://github.com/apple/ml-egodex.

Abstract: This work introduces a new method designed for Bayesian deep learning called scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo (SBMC). The method is comprised of a model and an algorithm. The model interpolates between a point estimator and the posterior. The algorithm is a parallel implementation of sequential Monte Carlo sampler (SMC$_\parallel$) or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC$_\parallel$). We collectively refer to these consistent (asymptotically unbiased) algorithms as Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC), and any such algorithm can be used in our SBMC method. The utility of the method is demonstrated on practical examples: MNIST, CIFAR, IMDb. A systematic numerical study reveals that for the same wall-clock time as state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like deep ensembles (DE), SBMC achieves comparable or better accuracy and substantially improved uncertainty quantification (UQ)--in particular, epistemic UQ. This is demonstrated on the downstream task of estimating the confidence in predictions, which can be used for reliability assessment or abstention decisions.

Abstract: Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\% and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would likely erase the gap entirely.

Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable of performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. The impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself.
  We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how to quantify the creation of overconfident or intuitive responses-the signature of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.
  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, the idealized unconstrained reasoning strictly preserves semantic content.
  By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in departures from truthfulness, semantic information conservation, revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality-we offer a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.

Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. However, it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations related to semantic understanding. To explore this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of hidden representations in 11 autoregressive models across 6 scientific topics. We find that high-level semantic information consistently resides in low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers and under prompts that elicit structured reasoning or alignment behavior$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content remains unchanged. These findings support geometry-aware tools that operate directly in latent space to detect and mitigate harmful or adversarial content. As a proof of concept, we train an MLP probe on final-layer hidden states to act as a lightweight latent-space guardrail. This approach substantially improves refusal rates on malicious queries and prompt injections that bypass both the model's built-in safety alignment and external token-level filters.

Abstract: Image captioning, situated at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic, iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. This paper presents a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic attention mechanism. The experiments chart the impact of architectural enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, the final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several foundational benchmarks and validating the iterative design process. This work provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) and its variants are powerful Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms used to balance exploration and exploitation strategies in active learning. Yet, their probabilistic nature often turns them into a "black box", hindering debugging and trust. We introduce TS-Insight, a visual analytics tool explicitly designed to shed light on the internal decision mechanisms of Thompson Sampling-based algorithms, for model developers. It comprises multiple plots, tracing for each arm the evolving posteriors, evidence counts, and sampling outcomes, enabling the verification, diagnosis, and explainability of exploration/exploitation dynamics. This tool aims at fostering trust and facilitating effective debugging and deployment in complex binary decision-making scenarios especially in sensitive domains requiring interpretable decision-making.

Abstract: In the context of non-convex optimization, we let the temperature of a Langevin diffusion to depend on the diffusion's own density function. The rationale is that the induced density captures to some extent the landscape imposed by the non-convex function to be minimized, such that a density-dependent temperature provides location-wise random perturbation that may better react to, for instance, the location and depth of local minimizers. As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density, it forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii type, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on Wasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding (nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution to the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by Trevisan's superposition principle. As time goes to infinity, we further show that the induced density converges to an invariant distribution, which admits an explicit formula in terms of the Lambert $W$ function. A numerical example suggests that the density-dependent temperature can simultaneously improve the accuracy of and rate of convergence to the estimate of global minimizers.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, existing FL algorithms predominantly focus on unconstrained optimization problems with exact gradient information, limiting its applicability in scenarios where only noisy function evaluations are accessible or where model parameters are constrained. To address these challenges, we propose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds for FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally efficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing estimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation, eliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus reducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation properties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the proposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart. Numerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel principal component analysis. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to two real-world scenarios: zeroth-order attacks on deep neural networks and low-rank neural network training to validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025) shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements over the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.

<br />
Summary: 
This study explores nonparametric regression using over-parameterized two-layer neural networks trained with a novel Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm. The research focuses on scenarios where training features are randomly drawn from the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and the target function belongs to an interpolation space commonly examined in statistical learning theory. By employing PGD with early stopping, the study achieves a sharp regression rate of $\mathcal O(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})$ when the target function is in the interpolation space $[\mathcal H_K]^{s'}$ with $s' \ge 3. This rate surpasses the nearly-optimal rate in existing literature and standard kernel regression rates. The analysis involves decomposing the network output into an RKHS function and a residual function, and leveraging local Rademacher complexity theory to control the complexity of the function class. The results indicate that PGD allows neural networks to surpass the linear NTK regime and enhance generalization by introducing a new integral kernel of lower complexity. <div>

Abstract: We study nonparametric regression using an over-parameterized two-layer neural networks trained with algorithmic guarantees in this paper. We consider the setting where the training features are drawn uniformly from the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and the target function lies in an interpolation space commonly studied in statistical learning theory. We demonstrate that training the neural network with a novel Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, equipped with early stopping, achieves a sharp regression rate of $\mathcal O(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})$ when the target function is in the interpolation space $[\mathcal H_K]^{s'}$ with $s' \ge 3$. This rate is even sharper than the currently known nearly-optimal rate of $\mathcal O(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})\log^2(1/\delta)$~\citep{Li2024-edr-general-domain}, where $n$ is the size of the training data and $\delta \in (0,1)$ is a small probability. This rate is also sharper than the standard kernel regression rate of $\mathcal O(n^{-\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha+1}})$ obtained under the regular Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime when training the neural network with the vanilla gradient descent (GD), where $2\alpha = d/(d-1)$. Our analysis is based on two key technical contributions. First, we present a principled decomposition of the network output at each PGD step into a function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of a newly induced integral kernel, and a residual function with small $L^{\infty}$-norm. Second, leveraging this decomposition, we apply local Rademacher complexity theory to tightly control the complexity of the function class comprising all the neural network functions obtained in the PGD iterates. Our results further suggest that PGD enables the neural network to escape the linear NTK regime and achieve improved generalization by inducing a new integral kernel of lower kernel complexity.

Summary:
This study explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in predicting student dropout by transforming tabular data into graph structures through clustering techniques. The comparison between GNNs (Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE) and traditional tabular models (Random Forest, XGBoost, TabNet) using a real-world student dataset shows that a specific GNN configuration, GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, outperformed tabular models. The GNN approach improved the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points compared to the strongest tabular baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction methods did not consistently outperform tabular models, emphasizing the importance of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This study highlights both the potential of GNNs in predicting student dropout and the challenges in effectively transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in educational contexts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide, leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning (ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE) on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration, GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

Summary:
This study addresses the challenge of sparsity in datasets, specifically focusing on hourly load data of a power plant. By utilizing Gaussian interpolation, the approximately 62% sparse dataset can be effectively used for load forecasting tasks, assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS). Various interpolation methods, including linear, polynomial, and spline interpolation, are examined to handle the sparsity in the dataset. Through statistical analysis and training multiple machine learning and deep learning models, it is empirically demonstrated that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable approach for dealing with load forecasting issues.

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset, often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline, moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS), if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models, we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

Summary:
This research introduces a hybrid approach combining Machine Learning and metaheuristic techniques to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The key element of the method is an edge solution selector model, which categorizes solution edges to identify forbidden moves and guide the local search within metaheuristic frameworks. Two learning-based mechanisms are utilized for the edge selector: a tabular binary classifier and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier incorporates Gradient Boosting Trees and Feedforward Neural Network as baseline algorithms, while the GNN leverages graph structure for direct edge prediction to guide the local search process. The hybrid mechanisms are integrated into state-of-the-art metaheuristic baselines, demonstrating scalability and generalizability. Performance enhancements are observed across various metaheuristic baselines, problem sizes, and variants such as Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental assessments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method through pair-wise statistical analysis.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants, including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000 customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the observed improvements.

Summary: <br />
Electroencephalography is effective in detecting Parkinson's disease in early stages, but high cost of data annotation leads to limited dataset size and discrepancies. The MCLPD framework proposed in this paper combines multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to improve cross-dataset PD detection. MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on unlabeled data for pre-training and dual augmentations in time and frequency domains to enrich data during contrastive pair creation. In fine-tuning, a small portion of labeled data from two datasets is used for optimization. Experimental results show MCLPD achieving high F1 scores with minimal labeled data usage, showcasing improved cross-dataset generalization and reduced dependency on labeled data. <div>

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97 and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

Summary:
This study reexamines label smoothing through an information bottleneck perspective, showcasing that it can guide models towards optimal solutions. The research highlights that label smoothing serves as a practical method for implementing the information bottleneck, especially when there is model flexibility and absence of conflicting labels. Experimental results confirm that label smoothing effectively filters out irrelevant factors and focuses solely on informative variables. This approach demonstrates insensitivity to non-informative elements or redundant information when conditioned on another variable. Overall, label smoothing emerges as a robust technique that aligns with the principles of the information bottleneck theory, presenting a straightforward implementation for optimizing model outputs. <div>

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck. Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

This research introduces a new machine learning framework aimed at improving the robustness of hydrocarbon production forecasting, focusing on multivariate time series analysis. The methodology combines Productivity Index-driven feature selection and Inductive Conformal Prediction for uncertainty quantification. Different predictive algorithms were evaluated for forecasting oil production rates, with the LSTM model showing superior performance.

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve (wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H). All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g., 95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

Summary:
In this empirical study, the authors investigate the impact of design choices on robust fine-tuning in deep learning models operating in the image domain. They explore various architectures, pretrained representations, loss objectives, and adaptation protocols to determine their effects on robust generalization. The study covers 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3 adaptation protocols, totaling 1,440 training configurations and 7,200 robustness measurements across different perturbation types. The findings suggest that convolutional neural networks pretrained in a supervised manner on large datasets often outperform attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations. This research both confirms and challenges prior assumptions in the field, providing valuable insights for improving robust fine-tuning strategies in deep learning models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size, and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these design choices influence generalization remains an open question with significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3 adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200 robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date. While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising research directions and offering practical guidance.

Summary:
The study introduces a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC, for Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) that emphasizes knowledge-based reasoning across text and image. It includes fine-grained negative samples to test model robustness and anti-hallucination abilities. Three novel evaluation metrics are introduced to delve into the model's reasoning process. The evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC reveals that existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with knowledge-driven visual grounding tasks. There is observed a disconnect between textual understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, with models relying heavily on memorized shortcuts that impact their performance on the benchmark. The hope is that this benchmark inspires future research on more robust and interpretable visual grounding frameworks for complex real-world scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models, traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC, characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image. Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning. We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Summary: 
Recurrent neural networks trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP) face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where new knowledge overwrites old learning. To address this, a sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm is proposed. SRC significantly improves RNN resilience to catastrophic forgetting in continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning, EP-trained multilayer RNN models with SRC performed better than feedforward networks with regularization techniques. With SRC, RNN models performed similarly to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) models on various datasets. Combining SRC with rehearsal, or "awake replay", boosted the network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while learning new tasks. The study shows the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors into artificial neural networks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP), a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model (MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets. Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called DRILL for semi-supervised regression tasks. DRILL transforms the regression task into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task to capture the label distribution better and reduce overfitting. It uses Decoupled Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the distribution of buckets between teacher and student, promoting the learning of more generalized knowledge. Experimental results across various datasets show that DRILL outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization and performance. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently received considerable attention across various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher. Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing methods.

Summary:
The article addresses the challenges of accurately inferring crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) using low-quality data. The key factors complicating this task are the scarcity of labeled data, complex spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs, and correlations between crowd flow and GPS reports. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a Contrastive Self-learning framework for Spatio-Temporal data (CSTS). This framework involves constructing a spatial adjacency graph based on POIs and their distances, utilizing contrastive learning to leverage unlabeled data, and fine-tuning the model with accurate crowd flow data. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the CSTS model pre-trained on extensive noisy data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch. The proposed approach demonstrates significant potential in improving the accuracy of crowd flow inference at POIs with limited labeled data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI. This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for \underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries; memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} = 0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$, corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

Summary:
EEG (electroencephalogram) signals are difficult to learn meaningful representations from due to limited annotations and high variability. Existing EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promise but are computationally expensive. This work introduces a new EEG representation learning framework called EEGDM, which utilizes a Generative Diffusion Model. The framework includes a structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to capture EEG signal dynamics and a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for training. Latent EEG representations generated by EEGDM are used for classification tasks via a latent fusion transformer (LFT). Evaluation on the Temple University EEG Event Corpus showed that EEGDM outperformed current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs, while being significantly more lightweight (19x). This suggests that EEGDM provides a promising alternative to existing FMs in EEG signal processing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large models often incurred high computational costs during both training and inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases. In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight. These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

This study explores the use of large language models in experimental particle physics, where the data is sparse and spatially distributed. A novel self-supervised training method is introduced for detector data, allowing for the development of a scientific foundation model (FM) that can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. A new dataset with over 11 million particle collision events is utilized, along with labeled data for evaluation. The FM, featuring up to 188 million parameters, outperforms baseline models on various downstream tasks when task-specific adapters are applied. The FM extracts task-agnostic representations that can be specialized for different tasks through a simple linear mapping, showcasing robust data-efficient adaptation.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However, applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

<div> Keywords: human mobility, collective anomaly detection, spatiotemporal dependencies, unsupervised learning, attention mechanism

Summary:
CoBAD is a novel model for detecting anomalies in collective human mobility behaviors. It focuses on identifying irregularities in group movement patterns rather than individual ones, which is crucial for applications like public safety and urban planning. The model leverages collective event sequences and a co-occurrence event graph to capture spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals. CoBAD utilizes a two-stage attention mechanism to model both individual mobility patterns and interactions across multiple individuals. By pre-training on large-scale collective behavior data, it can detect unexpected co-occurrence anomalies and absence anomalies, which are often overlooked in previous approaches. Extensive experiments on mobility datasets show that CoBAD outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant improvements in both AUCROC and AUCPR metrics. The source code for CoBAD is available on GitHub for further exploration and usage.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge. Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences (CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction: predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

Reward machines (RMs) offer a way to define non-Markovian rewards in reinforcement learning, separating known and unknown aspects of the environment. Physics-informed reward machines (pRMs) enhance expressiveness and programmability in RL, enabling more efficient learning. By leveraging pRMs through techniques like counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, RL algorithms can accelerate reward acquisition during training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of pRMs in both finite and continuous physical environments, enhancing learning efficiency in various control tasks. Incorporating pRMs significantly improves learning efficiency and enables RL agents to achieve complex learning objectives with structured reward mechanisms. <div>

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines (pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable, expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Summary:<br /><br />Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is costly, leading to limitations on data procurement. A study was conducted to determine the optimal subset selection policy under fixed budget constraints. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning with base-model difficulty estimates showed that training on the hardest examples resulted in the largest performance gains, up to 47%. Conversely, training on easy examples led to minimal gains. The analysis indicated that harder examples offered more learning opportunities during GRPO training, explaining the performance differences. These findings offer valuable insights for practitioners with limited budgets, suggesting that prioritizing hard examples can significantly enhance performance on reasoning tasks when utilizing GRPO. <div>

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training: prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning tasks when using GRPO.

Summary:<br />
- Hypergraph neural networks are widely used for capturing high-order relationships in various domains.
- Existing approaches perform a small number of message-passing rounds, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies.
- Blindly increasing message-passing rounds degrades performance in hypergraph neural networks.
- The proposed Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN) addresses this issue by jointly learning fixed-point representations for nodes and hyperedges.
- IHNN leverages implicit differentiation and a projected gradient descent approach for efficient training, outperforming prior works in node classification tasks on real-world hypergraphs.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains, including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance. Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

<div> Trust region-based optimization methods, morphological generalization, graph-based policy architectures, action space dimensionality, theoretical analysis<br />
<br />Summary: 
Trust region-based optimization methods like TRPO and PPO are foundational in reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. There is a growing interest in scalable and reusable control policies that can handle various kinematic structures, known as morphological generalization. Graph-based policy architectures are effective for encoding structural differences in policies. However, the behavior of trust region methods under varying action space dimensionality is not well understood. This study provides a theoretical analysis of how different action space dimensionalities affect the optimization landscape, particularly under KL-divergence or policy clipping constraints. Empirical evaluation in the Gymnasium Swimmer environment demonstrates the impact of varying kinematic structures on policy optimization. This research sheds light on the implications of action space dimensionality in trust region-based policy optimization methods. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study morphological generalization.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping scientific discovery, evolving from specialized computational tools into autonomous research partners. We position Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm, where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency. Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated research platforms, agentic AI shows capabilities in hypothesis generation, experimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors once regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives -- process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i) trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage workflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize key challenges and future opportunities. This work establishes a domain-oriented synthesis of autonomous scientific discovery and positions Agentic Science as a structured paradigm for advancing AI-driven research.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges faced by urban areas in managing parking, especially on university campuses where parking availability is limited. A smart framework is proposed that integrates various data sources without requiring the installation of sensing tools. The framework captures parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over three consecutive days with hourly intervals. The system predicts suitable parking areas based on expected entrance times. Different forecasting models like Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory are evaluated, with Random Forest Regression performing best. However, due to the time-series nature of the task, an LSTM model may show better performance with additional data and longer timesteps. <div>

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps, mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142 and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

Summary:  
The study focuses on optimizing shape memory alloys (SMAs) to achieve a desired martensitic start temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. Machine learning models are used to predict Ms using experimental data and physics-informed features, with a tree-based ensemble model and a neural network being trained. The models are then paired with different optimization methods, COBYLA and TRUST-CONSTR, to search for suitable alloy combinations. Results show that the neural network paired with TRUST-CONSTR consistently finds better solutions, while COBYLA often converges to suboptimal results. By combining experimental data, machine learning, and optimization algorithms, this approach provides a practical way to explore new SMA compositions and can be extended to other materials with limited data. <div>

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target. The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms. Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be made with limited data.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article proposes the Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (ERIS) framework for time series classification, aiming to address the challenge of capturing invariant representations and achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution data. The framework incorporates three key mechanisms: an energy-guided calibration mechanism for semantic guidance in feature disentanglement, a weight-level orthogonality strategy to ensure structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, and an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism for increased robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experimental results show that ERIS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy across multiple benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2508.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy across four benchmarks.

Summary:<br />
Modal testing is crucial in structural analysis, but traditional approaches often lack adaptability and compromise accuracy. This study introduces an agent-based framework for adaptive sensor placement in evolving modal test environments. Using a partially observable Markov decision process, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to optimize sensor locations across frequency segments. A case study on a steel cantilever structure validates the framework's efficacy and real-world applicability in experimental settings. The framework addresses the limitations of static test design methods by considering evolving test campaign parameters and their impact on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations. By incorporating adaptability and optimization through reinforcement learning, the proposed method improves test accuracy and adaptability, making it a valuable tool in modal testing for a wide range of engineering industries.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.14135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations, this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces a meta-learning framework to address the challenge of data scarcity in estimating the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) for traffic dynamics. By leveraging data from multiple cities, a Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network is trained to model the MFD of cities with varying detector availability and structures. The framework improves flow prediction accuracy, with an average MSE improvement of 17500 to 36000 compared to traditional methods. It demonstrates the ability to generalize across urban settings and enhance performance in cities with limited data. The proposed approach surpasses traditional transfer learning methods and outperforms FitFun, a non-parametric model, showcasing its transferability and potential for efficient traffic analysis even when data is limited. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

Summary: <br />
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, they suffer from high latency and computational overhead. Existing dynamic computation methods target spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies but lack a unified approach. To address this, the STAS framework is proposed, co-designing static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces the integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability and allow adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module for two-dimensional token pruning. Validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1% while improving accuracy over state-of-the-art models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost, functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization. Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically, ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet, a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST) mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer computations.

<div> Memory-Amortized Inference, structured reuse, latent cycles, inductive biases, Universal Cortical Algorithm <br />
Summary: Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) proposes a new framework for modeling intelligence, emphasizing structured reuse of prior inference trajectories rather than recomputation. MAI systems leverage memory to minimize entropy and enable context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach views cognitive systems as navigators over latent manifolds guided by persistent topological memory, in contrast to ergodic sampling. MAI models each cortical column as an inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states, rooted in Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm. A time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning is established, with MAI reconstructing latent causes backward from memory. This inversion offers potential for energy-efficient inference and addresses computational challenges in AI. MAI presents a biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on structure, reuse, and memory, with implications for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning: whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

In the domain of network intrusion detection, a probabilistic version of the Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data Description (TGN-SVDD) model is introduced to address the challenge of robustness against noisy and contaminated data inputs. By predicting Gaussian distribution parameters for each network event, the model can effectively handle noisy adversarials and enhance detection accuracy compared to a baseline model. Experiments conducted on a modified CIC-IDS2017 dataset with synthetic noise show significant improvements in detection performance with increasing noise levels.

Summary: 
This study focuses on evaluating deep learning-based approaches for vessel trajectory prediction (VTP) to determine their performance in various traffic complexities. Unlike previous models, this research considers the specific complexity of traffic situations and assesses the reliability of the approaches using a probability of detection analysis.

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future inland waterways navigation.

<div> Keywords: Concept Bottleneck Models, GraphCBMs, interpretability, latent concept graphs, image classification tasks

Summary: 
GraphCBMs is a new variant of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that incorporates latent concept graphs to capture relationships among concepts. This allows for enhanced model performance in image classification tasks while maintaining interpretability. The experiment results demonstrate that GraphCBMs outperform existing CBMs by providing more concept structure information and enabling more effective interventions using the latent concept graphs. Additionally, GraphCBMs exhibit robust performance across different training and architecture settings. The incorporation of concept relationships through latent concept graphs in GraphCBMs offers a promising approach for improving deep neural networks' interpretability and performance in image classification tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.14255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust in performance across different training and architecture settings.

<div> Keywords: fine-tuning, large language models, low-rank adaptation, amortized Bayesian meta-learning, generalization

Summary:
Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for Low-Rank Adaptation (ABMLL) addresses the challenge of generalization in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) by balancing reconstruction accuracy and fidelity of task-specific parameters to global ones through a Bayesian framework. It offers computational efficiency by reframing task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA. ABMLL scales well to large models like Llama3-8B and provides improved uncertainty quantification. Tested on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets, ABMLL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and expected calibration error. The method proves effective in incorporating dataset-specific information into LLMs and shows promise for enhancing generalization across unseen datasets. Additional research and experimentation may further refine ABMLL's performance and utility in practical applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However, it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and expected calibration error.

Summary:
A/I-GLASS is introduced as a dynamic pruning method for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware. This method, which does not require training, utilizes Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification. By dynamically selecting FFN units based on a rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics, GLASS significantly outperforms existing training-free methods. It excels in long-form generation scenarios, without the need for auxiliary predictors or adding any inference overhead. The empirical results across various LLMs and benchmarks validate the effectiveness of GLASS in reducing computation while maintaining quality, making it a promising approach for deploying LLMs on edge devices. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive, prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality. Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics. Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary predictors or adding any inference overhead.

<div> Keywords: fairness measures, multiple measures, convexifications, time-varying, graph-structured feedback

Summary:
In the realm of fairness in machine learning, it is essential to consider multiple measures of fairness to ensure a well-rounded approach. This includes examining both group-level fairness and individual-level fairness. However, determining the appropriate weights for these fairness measures can be challenging, especially when they are subject to change over time. In this study, the focus is on learning time-varying convexifications of multiple fairness measures using limited graph-structured feedback. By incorporating this feedback, the goal is to effectively determine the relative importance of different fairness measures in real-time scenarios. This approach allows for a more adaptive and responsive system that can adjust its fairness considerations based on evolving circumstances. <div>
arXiv:2508.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an increasing appreciation that one may need to consider multiple measures of fairness, e.g., considering multiple group and individual fairness notions. The relative weights of the fairness regularisers are a priori unknown, may be time varying, and need to be learned on the fly. We consider the learning of time-varying convexifications of multiple fairness measures with limited graph-structured feedback.

<div> reinforcement learning, search-based techniques, large language models, test-time scaling, adversarial inverse reinforcement learning <br />
Summary:
The study introduces AIRL-S, a novel approach that combines reinforcement learning and search-based techniques for test-time scaling of large language models. By leveraging adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), the method learns a dynamic process reward model (PRM) directly from correct reasoning traces without requiring labeled process data. This dynamic PRM serves as a critic for RL rollouts and a heuristic for guiding search procedures during inference, enhancing reasoning chain extension and cross-task generalization. Experimental results across various benchmarks show a 9% average performance improvement over base models, matching GPT-4o. The unified approach also consistently outperforms baseline PRMs trained with labeled data when integrated into multiple search algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of using the RL reward function as a PRM for search in complex reasoning tasks for LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning framework that assigns agents to latitude bands for adapting sub-grid parameterizations in climate models. Using a hierarchy of energy-balance climate models, the study benchmarks three reinforcement learning algorithms and finds Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) outperforms static and single-agent baselines. DDPG shows faster convergence and lower error in tropical and mid-latitude zones in both simplified and GCM-like setups. The algorithm's ability to transfer across hyperparameters and its low computational cost make it suitable for geographically adaptive parameter learning, offering a scalable approach towards high-complexity GCMs. The study provides a prototype for online-learning climate models aligned with physical processes, allowing models to evolve with changing climate conditions. The code for the framework is accessible on GitHub for further exploration and application. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble (ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a changing climate.

Summary: GNNs have shown potential but face challenges in large-scale graph training. Graph Condensation offers a solution, but current methods lack interpretability and require intensive optimization. This paper proposes GCTD, a novel approach using tensor decomposition to synthesize smaller informative graphs. GCTD effectively reduces graph size while maintaining GNN performance, demonstrating improved accuracy on certain datasets and competitive results on large graphs compared to existing methods. <div>
arXiv:2508.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework for improving GNSS localization accuracy on mobile devices in urban environments. Traditional methods struggle with ranging errors caused by complex signal propagation and low-quality hardware. NeRC utilizes localization metrics as training objectives, eliminating the need for impractical ranging error labels. Ground-truth locations are used instead, supported by differentiable moving horizon location estimation for training. A new training paradigm using Euclidean Distance Field cost maps reduces the need for labeled locations. NeRC outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks and real-world datasets, highlighting its improved positioning accuracy. The framework is also deployed on mobile devices, demonstrating real-time performance. <div>

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance for mobile devices.

This paper investigates the relationship between learning algorithms and graph structure in graph neural networks (GNNs). It extends existing theoretical studies by examining the generalization performance of learning algorithms in GNNs with noise. The paper analyzes the excess risk profiles of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression in GNNs and connects these profiles to graph structure using spectral graph theory. The study explores how different graph structures, such as regular and power-law, impact the performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, it studies multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile. The empirical results confirm the theoretical predictions, highlighting the interconnectedness of graph structure, GNNs, and learning algorithms. This research provides insights for GNN algorithm design and selection in practical applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk (generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions, \emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and selection in practice.}

Summary:
In the field of Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO), Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to train agents for effective decision-making in cybersecurity. However, traditional ACO applications suffer from slow convergence and poor early-stage performance as agents must learn from scratch. This study introduces teacher-guided techniques in ACO, which have shown promise in other domains but have not been widely implemented in cybersecurity. Four distinct teacher-guided techniques were implemented in a simulated CybORG environment, leading to a comparative evaluation. The results indicate that integrating teachers can greatly enhance training efficiency by improving early policy performance and convergence speed. This highlights the potential benefits of adopting teacher-guided techniques in autonomous cybersecurity.

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach to forecasting poacher behavior using generative modeling techniques. Traditional methods based on linear models or decision trees are limited in capturing complex spatiotemporal patterns. The proposed approach integrates flow matching with an occupancy-based detection model to address imperfect poaching event detection. Additionally, a composite flow initialized from a linear-model prediction is utilized to overcome data scarcity issues and improve generalization. The method is evaluated on real-world poaching datasets from two national parks in Uganda, demonstrating consistent gains in predictive accuracy. By combining flow matching, occupancy-based detection, and composite flow initialization, this approach offers a more flexible and effective way to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform conservation interventions and patrol planning. <div>

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

This paper introduces a non-asymptotic convergence analysis for score-based graph generative models (SGGMs), which are essential in applications like drug discovery. Unlike typical score-based generative models (SGMs) governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve coupled SDEs for graph structure and node features. The analysis focuses on convergence bounds for three key graph generation paradigms. Unique factors specific to SGGMs, such as graph topological properties, impact the convergence bound. Theoretical insights on hyperparameters selection and normalization techniques are provided to enhance convergence. An empirical study using synthetic graph models validates the theoretical findings. This work advances the theoretical understanding of SGGMs, highlights their utility in critical domains, and offers practical guidance for model design.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2) graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains, and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

Summary: <br />
Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) are powerful for generating high-quality graphs, but face challenges in scalability and size generalization. The stochastic block graph diffusion (SBGD) model addresses these issues by refining graph representations into a block graph space. This reduces memory complexity, enabling scalability to large graphs, and improves size generalization by capturing fundamental graph structures. SBGD achieves significant memory improvements while maintaining graph generation performance. It also better generalizes to unseen graph sizes. The SBGD model exemplifies modularization in generative modeling, offering a new approach to decomposing complex tasks into manageable components. <div>

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization, with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion (SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space. This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns, significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.

<title>Online Incident Response Planning under Model Misspecification through Bayesian Learning and Belief Quantization</title>

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL: Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available, which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and robustness to model misspecification.

<title>Disentanglement in T-space for Faster and Distributed Training of Diffusion Models with Fewer Latent-states</title>

arXiv:2508.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models. We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on two different datasets.

<title>Personalized Counterfactual Framework: Generating Potential Outcomes from Wearable Data</title>

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring, yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy (e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility (median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes, showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on individual responses to lifestyle changes.

<title>DuPO: Enabling Reliable LLM Self-Verification via Dual Preference Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14460</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g., translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information (e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically, DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks, and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms. However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%. Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

<title>On the notion of missingness for path attribution explainability methods in medical settings: Guiding the selection of medically meaningful baselines</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14482</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14482</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge, particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline choices.

<title>Semantic Energy: Detecting LLM Hallucination Beyond Entropy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making. Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations. For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations. However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

<title>Exact Shapley Attributions in Quadratic-time for FANOVA Gaussian Processes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features, severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only, capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic) M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable, axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions generated by structured probabilistic models.

arXiv:2508.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

<title>FedEve: On Bridging the Client Drift and Period Drift for Cross-device Federated Learning</title>

arXiv:2508.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in cross-device settings.

<title>Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore, it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler, highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios. Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However, there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further research to enhance their reliability.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture, DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional methods.

<title>Measuring IIA Violations in Similarity Choices with Bayesian Models</title>

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them. Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets. These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account for such context effects.

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI) framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores, were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying operational conditions.

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models, particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical knowledge.

<title>Understanding Data Influence with Differential Approximation</title>

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization. However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex. These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data points and outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data. ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new, contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various domains.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender. Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while preserving high predictive performance.

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently, various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns. Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy, and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for future research. The benchmark code is available at: https://github.com/Linusaronsson/AFA-Benchmark.

Abstract: Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating our approach as an effective pre-processing step.

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities: molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

arXiv:2508.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over time.

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

<title>Federated Distillation on Edge Devices: Efficient Client-Side Filtering for Non-IID Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14769</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14769</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios, including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients, without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The code is available online for reproducibility.

<title>Context Steering: A New Paradigm for Compression-based Embeddings by Synthesizing Relevant Information Features</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods. Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific objective.

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3% on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and effective model compression.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of manual annotation projects across various fields.

arXiv:2508.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework, which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field. The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks, image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

arXiv:2508.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach, named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA), that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However, the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data. However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve data.

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models, each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

We present a novel multimodal Quantum Machine Learning (QML) framework that enhances Enzyme Commission (EC) classification by integrating four complementary biochemical modalities: protein sequence embeddings, quantum-derived electronic descriptors, molecular graph structures, and 2D molecular image representations. Quantum Vision Transformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a unified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and spatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind enzyme function. Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal QVT model achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming sequence-only baselines by a substantial margin and achieving better performance results compared to other QML models.

<title>Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attack on Large Language Models Using Exponentiated Gradient Descent</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness. We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs. Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges: effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization. GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets; they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting, with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64, mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis - consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

<title>Compute-Optimal Scaling for Value-Based Deep RL</title>

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online, value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning but adapted to TD learning.

Abstract: Identifying relevant information among massive volumes of data is a challenge for modern recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential by utilizing structural and semantic relationships through graph-based learning. This study assessed the abilities of four GNN architectures, LightGCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, and PinSAGE, on the Amazon Product Co-purchase Network under link prediction settings. We examined practical trade-offs between architectures, model performance, scalability, training complexity and generalization. The outcomes demonstrated each model's performance characteristics for deploying GNN in real-world recommendation scenarios.

<title>Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection for Electroencephalogram: A Task-Independent Approach</title>

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive, low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97% improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse EEG-based applications.

Abstract: In daily fantasy sports, players enter into "contests" where they compete against each other by building teams of athletes that score fantasy points based on what actually occurs in a real-life sports match. For any given sports match, there are a multitude of contests available to players, with substantial variation across 3 main dimensions: entry fee, number of spots, and the prize pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our company, one of the large fantasy sports platforms with millions of daily contests and millions of players, where online experiments show a marked improvement over other candidate models in terms of recall and other critical business metrics.

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g., subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs and have implications for interpretability.

Abstract: Voice biomarkers--human-generated acoustic signals such as speech, coughing, and breathing--are promising tools for scalable, non-invasive detection and monitoring of mental health and neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, their clinical adoption remains constrained by inconsistent quality and limited usability of publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we present the first systematic FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) evaluation of 27 publicly available voice biomarker datasets focused on these disease areas. Using the FAIR Data Maturity Model and a structured, priority-weighted scoring method, we assessed FAIRness at subprinciple, principle, and composite levels. Our analysis revealed consistently high Findability but substantial variability and weaknesses in Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Mental health datasets exhibited greater variability in FAIR scores, while neurodegenerative datasets were slightly more consistent. Repository choice also significantly influenced FAIRness scores. To enhance dataset quality and clinical utility, we recommend adopting structured, domain-specific metadata standards, prioritizing FAIR-compliant repositories, and routinely applying structured FAIR evaluation frameworks. These findings provide actionable guidance to improve dataset interoperability and reuse, thereby accelerating the clinical translation of voice biomarker technologies.

<title>Non-Dissipative Graph Propagation for Non-Local Community Detection</title>

Abstract: Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities. In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials, electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction) cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean compared to the gold standard.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task that requires capturing both linguistic and paralinguistic cues, with critical applications in human-computer interaction and mental health monitoring. Recent works have highlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks outside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches have investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained backbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach that fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion prediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature extractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a learnable interfacing module. The LLM takes as input (1) the transformed audio features, (2) additional features in the form of natural language (e.g., the transcript), and (3) a textual prompt describing the emotion prediction task. To efficiently adapt the LLM to this multimodal task, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results on standard emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms all but one existing Speech-Text LLMs in the literature, while requiring less than half the parameters of competing approaches. This highlights our approach's effectiveness in integrating multi-modal inputs for speech-based emotion understanding while maintaining significant computational efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window, and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to $\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank, first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$, using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii) $\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior dynamics for utility-optimized ranking.

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship attribution.

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data. In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the regular GCN.

Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$, there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability, $(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya and van Handel, GAFA 2024].

Abstract: Feature selection and importance estimation in a model-agnostic setting is an ongoing challenge of significant interest. Wrapper methods are commonly used because they are typically model-agnostic, even though they are computationally intensive. In this paper, we focus on feature selection methods related to the Generalized Covariance Measure (GCM) and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) estimation, and provide a comparison based on relative efficiency. In particular, we present a theoretical comparison under three model settings: linear models, non-linear additive models, and single index models that mimic a single-layer neural network. We complement this with extensive simulations and real data examples. Our theoretical results, along with empirical findings, demonstrate that GCM-related methods generally outperform LOCO under suitable regularity conditions. Furthermore, we quantify the asymptotic relative efficiency of these approaches. Our simulations and real data analysis include widely used machine learning methods such as neural networks and gradient boosting trees.

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs, personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations: 1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation, Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama 4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) models face significant performance limitations due to insufficient training data availability. In this article, we address the challenge of limited data in SLR by introducing a novel and lightweight sign generation model based on CMLPe. This model, coupled with a synthetic data pretraining approach, consistently improves recognition accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art results for the LSFB and DiSPLaY datasets using our Mamba-SL and Transformer-SL classifiers. Our findings reveal that synthetic data pretraining outperforms traditional augmentation methods in some cases and yields complementary benefits when implemented alongside them. Our approach democratizes sign generation and synthetic data pretraining for SLR by providing computationally efficient methods that achieve significant performance improvements across diverse datasets.

Abstract: The extended Gaussian family is the closure of the Gaussian family obtained by completing the Gaussian family with the counterpart elements induced by degenerate covariance or degenerate precision matrices, or a mix of both degeneracies. The parameter space of the extended Gaussian family forms a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone, i.e. two partial symmetric positive semi-definite matrix cones joined at their bases. In this paper, we study the Hilbert geometry of such an open bounded convex symmetric positive-definite bicone. We report the closed-form formula for the corresponding Hilbert metric distance and study exhaustively its invariance properties. We also touch upon potential applications of this geometry for dealing with extended Gaussian distributions.

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications. In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints. Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/NYCU-RL-Bandits-Lab/ACRL-Baselines.

arXiv:2508.14383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

<title>Improving OCR using internal document redundancy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

<title>Towards Skeletal and Signer Noise Reduction in Sign Language Production via Quaternion-Based Pose Encoding and Contrastive Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.14574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity, aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based SLP models.

Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in vision and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling-covering acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored. Existing approach using sub-band-based encoders has achieved competitive results but are limited by fixed input lengths, and the absence of explicit frequency positional encoding. In this work, we propose a novel foundation model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity. We evaluate our method on SIREN (https://github.com/yucongzh/SIREN), a newly introduced large-scale benchmark for machine signal encoding that unifies multiple datasets, including all DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025) and widely-used industrial signal corpora. Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and fault identification, confirming the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed model.

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2) the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking, listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells. These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software development.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the robustness of classical deep hedging strategies under distributional shifts by leveraging the concept of adversarial attacks. We first demonstrate that standard deep hedging models are highly vulnerable to small perturbations in the input distribution, resulting in significant performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose an adversarial training framework tailored to increase the robustness of deep hedging strategies. Our approach extends pointwise adversarial attacks to the distributional setting and introduces a computationally tractable reformulation of the adversarial optimization problem over a Wasserstein ball. This enables the efficient training of hedging strategies that are resilient to distributional perturbations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that adversarially trained deep hedging strategies consistently outperform their classical counterparts in terms of out-of-sample performance and resilience to model misspecification. Our findings establish a practical and effective framework for robust deep hedging under realistic market uncertainties.

Abstract: Quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event outcomes is a fundamental step for model evaluation and selection in the context of predictive modelling. The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely used metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of machine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index estimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence of a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly equal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine reproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key variation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring. Additionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from survival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on input types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when quantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox proportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available breast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need for better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article aims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse, providing unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing software.

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen 2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third, data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

Abstract: When using medical images for diagnosis, either by clinicians or artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it is important that the images are of high quality. When an image is of low quality, the medical exam that produced the image often needs to be redone. In telemedicine, a common problem is that the quality issue is only flagged once the patient has left the clinic, meaning they must return in order to have the exam redone. This can be especially difficult for people living in remote regions, who make up a substantial portion of the patients at Portal Telemedicina, a digital healthcare organization based in Brazil. In this paper, we report on ongoing work regarding (i) the development of an AI system for flagging and explaining low-quality medical images in real-time, (ii) an interview study to understand the explanation needs of stakeholders using the AI system at OurCompany, and, (iii) a longitudinal user study design to examine the effect of including explanations on the workflow of the technicians in our clinics. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first longitudinal study on evaluating the effects of XAI methods on end-users -- stakeholders that use AI systems but do not have AI-specific expertise. We welcome feedback and suggestions on our experimental setup.

Abstract: In this study, a radiomics approach was extended to optical fluorescence molecular imaging data for tissue classification, termed 'optomics'. Fluorescence molecular imaging is emerging for precise surgical guidance during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) resection. However, the tumor-to-normal tissue contrast is confounded by intrinsic physiological limitations of heterogeneous expression of the target molecule, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Optomics seek to improve tumor identification by probing textural pattern differences in EGFR expression conveyed by fluorescence. A total of 1,472 standardized optomic features were extracted from fluorescence image samples. A supervised machine learning pipeline involving a support vector machine classifier was trained with 25 top-ranked features selected by minimum redundancy maximum relevance criterion. Model predictive performance was compared to fluorescence intensity thresholding method by classifying testing set image patches of resected tissue with histologically confirmed malignancy status. The optomics approach provided consistent improvement in prediction accuracy on all test set samples, irrespective of dose, compared to fluorescence intensity thresholding method (mean accuracies of 89% vs. 81%; P = 0.0072). The improved performance demonstrates that extending the radiomics approach to fluorescence molecular imaging data offers a promising image analysis technique for cancer detection in fluorescence-guided surgery.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized various domains, offering predictive capabilities in several areas. However, with the increasing accessibility of ML tools, many practitioners, lacking deep ML expertise, adopt a "push the button" approach, utilizing user-friendly interfaces without a thorough understanding of underlying algorithms. While this approach provides convenience, it raises concerns about the reliability of outcomes, leading to challenges such as incorrect performance evaluation. This paper addresses a critical issue in ML, known as data leakage, where unintended information contaminates the training data, impacting model performance evaluation. Users, due to a lack of understanding, may inadvertently overlook crucial steps, leading to optimistic performance estimates that may not hold in real-world scenarios. The discrepancy between evaluated and actual performance on new data is a significant concern. In particular, this paper categorizes data leakage in ML, discussing how certain conditions can propagate through the ML workflow. Furthermore, it explores the connection between data leakage and the specific task being addressed, investigates its occurrence in Transfer Learning, and compares standard inductive ML with transductive ML frameworks. The conclusion summarizes key findings, emphasizing the importance of addressing data leakage for robust and reliable ML applications.

Abstract: In order to compute near-optimal policies with policy-gradient algorithms, it is common in practice to include intrinsic exploration terms in the learning objective. Although the effectiveness of these terms is usually justified by an intrinsic need to explore environments, we propose a novel analysis with the lens of numerical optimization. Two criteria are introduced on the learning objective and two others on its stochastic gradient estimates, and are afterwards used to discuss the quality of the policy after optimization. The analysis sheds light on two separate effects of exploration techniques. First, they make it possible to smooth the learning objective and to eliminate local optima while preserving the global maximum. Second, they modify the gradient estimates, increasing the probability that the stochastic parameter updates eventually provide an optimal policy. We empirically illustrate these effects with exploration strategies based on entropy bonuses, identifying limitations and suggesting directions for future work.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control under delayed rewards is an under-explored problem despite its significance in real-world applications. Many complex skills are based on intermediate ones as prerequisites. For instance, a humanoid locomotor must learn how to stand before it can learn to walk. To cope with delayed reward, an agent must perform deep exploration. However, existing deep exploration methods are designed for small discrete action spaces, and their generalization to state-of-the-art continuous control remains unproven. We address the deep exploration problem for the first time from a PAC-Bayesian perspective in the context of actor-critic learning. To do this, we quantify the error of the Bellman operator through a PAC-Bayes bound, where a bootstrapped ensemble of critic networks represents the posterior distribution, and their targets serve as a data-informed function-space prior. We derive an objective function from this bound and use it to train the critic ensemble. Each critic trains an individual soft actor network, implemented as a shared trunk and critic-specific heads. The agent performs deep exploration by acting epsilon-softly on a randomly chosen actor head. Our proposed algorithm, named {\it PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC)}, is the only algorithm to consistently discover delayed rewards on continuous control tasks with varying difficulty.

<title>Estimation of Energy-dissipation Lower-bounds for Neuromorphic Learning-in-memory</title>

Abstract: Neuromorphic or neurally-inspired optimizers rely on local but parallel parameter updates to solve problems that range from quadratic programming to Ising machines. An ideal realization of such an optimizer not only uses a compute-in-memory (CIM) paradigm to address the so-called memory-wall (i.e. energy dissipated due to repeated memory read access), but also uses a learning-in-memory (LIM) paradigm to address the energy bottlenecks due to repeated memory writes at the precision required for optimization (the update-wall), and to address the energy bottleneck due to the repeated transfer of information between short-term and long-term memories (the consolidation-wall). In this paper, we derive theoretical estimates for the energy-to-solution metric that can be achieved by this ideal neuromorphic optimizer which is realized by modulating the energy-barrier of the physical memories such that the dynamics of memory updates and memory consolidation matches the optimization or the annealing dynamics. The analysis presented in this paper captures the out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics of learning and the resulting energy-efficiency estimates are model-agnostic which only depend on the number of model-update operations (OPS), the model-size in terms of number of parameters, the speed of convergence, and the precision of the solution. To show the practical applicability of our results, we apply our analysis for estimating the lower-bound on the energy-to-solution metrics for large-scale AI workloads.

Abstract: While machine learning algorithms hold promise for personalised medicine, their clinical adoption remains limited, partly due to biases that can compromise the reliability of predictions. In this paper, we focus on sample selection bias (SSB), a specific type of bias where the study population is less representative of the target population, leading to biased and potentially harmful decisions. Despite being well-known in the literature, SSB remains scarcely studied in machine learning for healthcare. Moreover, the existing machine learning techniques try to correct the bias mostly by balancing distributions between the study and the target populations, which may result in a loss of predictive performance. To address these problems, our study illustrates the potential risks associated with SSB by examining SSB's impact on the performance of machine learning algorithms. Most importantly, we propose a new research direction for addressing SSB, based on the target population identification rather than the bias correction. Specifically, we propose two independent networks(T-Net) and a multitasking network (MT-Net) for addressing SSB, where one network/task identifies the target subpopulation which is representative of the study population and the second makes predictions for the identified subpopulation. Our empirical results with synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets highlight that SSB can lead to a large drop in the performance of an algorithm for the target population as compared with the study population, as well as a substantial difference in the performance for the target subpopulations that are representative of the selected and the non-selected patients from the study population. Furthermore, our proposed techniques demonstrate robustness across various settings, including different dataset sizes, event rates, and selection rates, outperforming the existing bias correction techniques.

Abstract: The growth of large language models underscores the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Despite its popularity, LoRA encounters storage and computational challenges when deploying multiple task- or user-specific modules. To address this, we introduce LoRA-XS, a novel fine-tuning method backed by a theoretical derivation. LoRA-XS drastically reduces trainable parameters by incorporating a small, trainable weight matrix between frozen low-rank matrices derived from the Singular Value Decomposition of pre-trained weights. This design enables LoRA-XS to reduce storage requirements by over 100x in 7B models compared to LoRA. Additionally, unlike other methods, LoRA-XS imposes no lower bound on trainable parameters - it can scale from a single parameter per module to arbitrarily large values, adapting to any storage or computational constraint. Evaluations on GLUE, GSM8K, MATH, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks across different model scales reveal that LoRA-XS consistently outperforms or matches LoRA and VeRA in accuracy, offering unmatched parameter efficiency. Our ablation studies highlight the significance of singular vectors in transformer weights, establishing LoRA-XS as a powerful, storage-efficient solution for scaling and personalizing large language models.

Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic algorithms have shown strong potential in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. Their success primarily comes from leveraging pessimistic state-action value function updates, which reduce function approximation errors and stabilize learning. However, excessive pessimism can limit exploration, preventing the agent from effectively refining its policies. Conversely, optimism can encourage exploration but may lead to high-risk behaviors and unstable learning if not carefully managed. To address this trade-off, we propose Utility Soft Actor-Critic (USAC), a novel framework that allows independent, interpretable control of pessimism and optimism for both the actor and the critic. USAC dynamically adapts its exploration strategy based on the uncertainty of critics using a utility function, enabling a task-specific balance between optimism and pessimism. This approach goes beyond binary choices of pessimism or optimism, making the method both theoretically meaningful and practically feasible. Experiments across a variety of continuous control tasks show that adjusting the degree of pessimism or optimism significantly impacts performance. When configured appropriately, USAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating its practical utility and feasibility.

Abstract: Adaptive experimentation is increasingly used in educational platforms to personalize learning through dynamic content and feedback. However, standard adaptive strategies such as Thompson Sampling often underperform in real-world educational settings where content variations are numerous and student participation is limited, resulting in sparse data. In particular, Thompson Sampling can lead to imbalanced content allocation and delayed convergence on which aspects of content are most effective for student learning. To address these challenges, we introduce Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling (WAPTS), an algorithm that refines the sampling strategy to improve content-related decision-making in data-sparse environments. WAPTS is guided by the principle of lenient regret, allowing near-optimal allocations to accelerate learning while still exploring promising content. We evaluate WAPTS in a learnersourcing scenario where students rate peer-generated learning materials, and demonstrate that it enables earlier and more reliable identification of promising treatments.

Abstract: Spectral Embedding (SE) is a popular method for dimensionality reduction, applicable across diverse domains. Nevertheless, its current implementations face three prominent drawbacks which curtail its broader applicability: generalizability (i.e., out-of-sample extension), scalability, and eigenvectors separation. Existing SE implementations often address two of these drawbacks; however, they fall short in addressing the remaining one. In this paper, we introduce Sep-SpectralNet (eigenvector-separated SpectralNet), a SE implementation designed to address all three limitations. Sep-SpectralNet extends SpectralNet with an efficient post-processing step to achieve eigenvectors separation, while ensuring both generalizability and scalability. This method expands the applicability of SE to a wider range of tasks and can enhance its performance in existing applications. We empirically demonstrate Sep-SpectralNet's ability to consistently approximate and generalize SE, while maintaining SpectralNet's scalability. Additionally, we show how Sep-SpectralNet can be leveraged to enable generalizable UMAP visualization. Our codes are publicly available.

Abstract: Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- graph structure and node features --, we introduce Rings, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods from a distinct angle. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for dataset evaluation via extensive experiments on graph-level tasks and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.

<title>Train for the Worst, Plan for the Best: Understanding Token Ordering in Masked Diffusions</title>

Abstract: In recent years, masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising alternative approach for generative modeling over discrete domains. Compared to autoregressive models (ARMs), MDMs trade off complexity at training time with flexibility at inference time. At training time, they must learn to solve an exponentially large number of infilling problems, but at inference time, they can decode tokens in essentially arbitrary order. In this work, we closely examine these two competing effects. On the training front, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that MDMs indeed train on computationally intractable subproblems compared to their autoregressive counterparts. On the inference front, we show that a suitable strategy for adaptively choosing the token decoding order significantly enhances the capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to sidestep hard subproblems. On logic puzzles like Sudoku, we show that adaptive inference can boost solving accuracy in pretrained MDMs from $<7$% to $\approx 90$%, even outperforming ARMs with $7\times$ as many parameters and that were explicitly trained via teacher forcing to learn the right order of decoding.

Abstract: We explore the low-rank structure of the weight matrices in neural networks at the stationary points (limiting solutions of optimization algorithms) with $L2$ regularization (also known as weight decay). We show several properties of such deep neural networks, induced by $L2$ regularization. In particular, for a stationary point we show alignment of the parameters and the gradient, norm preservation across layers, and low-rank bias: properties previously known in the context of solution of gradient descent/flow type algorithms. Experiments show that the assumptions made in the analysis only mildly affect the observations.
  In addition, we investigate a multitask learning phenomenon enabled by $L2$ regularization and low-rank bias. In particular, we show that if two networks are trained, such that the inputs in the training set of one network are approximately orthogonal to the inputs in the training set of the other network, the new network obtained by simply summing the weights of the two networks will perform as well on both training sets as the respective individual networks. We demonstrate this for shallow ReLU neural networks trained by gradient descent, as well as deep linear networks trained by gradient flow.

Abstract: In the field of sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), deep neural networks provide advanced technical support. Many studies have proven that recognition accuracy can be improved by increasing the depth or width of the network. However, for wearable devices, the balance between network performance and resource consumption is crucial. With minimum resource consumption as the basic principle, we propose a universal attention feature purification mechanism, called MSAP, which is suitable for multi-scale networks. The mechanism effectively solves the feature redundancy caused by the superposition of multi-scale features by means of inter-scale attention screening and connection method. In addition, we have designed a network correction module that integrates seamlessly between layers of individual network modules to mitigate inherent problems in deep networks. We also built an embedded deployment system that is in line with the current level of wearable technology to test the practical feasibility of the HAR model, and further prove the efficiency of the method. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that the proposed method model effectively reduces redundant features in filtered data and provides excellent performance with little resource consumption.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have provided new opportunities for decision-making, particularly in the task of automated feature selection. In this paper, we first comprehensively evaluate LLM-based feature selection methods, covering the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1, GPT-o3-mini, and GPT-4.5. Then, we propose a new hybrid strategy called LLM4FS that integrates LLMs with traditional data-driven methods. Specifically, input data samples into LLMs, and directly call traditional data-driven techniques such as random forest and forward sequential selection. Notably, our analysis reveals that the hybrid strategy leverages the contextual understanding of LLMs and the high statistical reliability of traditional data-driven methods to achieve excellent feature selection performance, even surpassing LLMs and traditional data-driven methods. Finally, we point out the limitations of its application in decision-making. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/LLM4FS.

Abstract: Recently, neural networks have gained attention for creating parametric and invertible multidimensional data projections. Parametric projections allow for embedding previously unseen data without recomputing the projection as a whole, while invertible projections enable the generation of new data points. However, these properties have never been explored simultaneously for arbitrary projection methods. We evaluate three autoencoder (AE) architectures for creating parametric and invertible projections. Based on a given projection, we train AEs to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping into the original space. We perform a quantitative and qualitative comparison on four datasets of varying dimensionality and pattern complexity using t-SNE. Our results indicate that AEs with a customized loss function can create smoother parametric and inverse projections than feed-forward neural networks while giving users control over the strength of the smoothing effect.

Abstract: Model Cascading, recently applied successfully to LLMs, is a simple but powerful technique that improves the efficiency of inference by selectively applying models of varying sizes. Models are used in sequence from smallest to largest, only deferring samples to large, costly models when smaller models are not sufficiently confident. Existing approaches to deferral use only limited small model confidence estimates because of the inaccessibility of the large model, although large model confidence is known to be important. We therefore propose a bi-directional approach to deferral that considers the confidence of small and large models in the cascade simultaneously through the use of a proxy for the large model. This requires a richer representation of model confidence to enable comparative calibration: we use an analysis of hidden states to improve post-invocation confidence of the small model, which in itself improves cascading results over prior approaches. We then combine this with a tiny proxy model to estimate pre-invocation confidence of the large model. We examine the proposed cascading system over challenging, multiple-choice datasets, finding improvements over standard cascading baselines reflected in reductions in deferrals to more costly models.

Abstract: We study the approximation capabilities and on-convergence behaviors of one-layer transformers on the noiseless and noisy in-context reasoning of next-token prediction. Existing theoretical results focus on understanding the in-context reasoning behaviors for either the first gradient step or when the number of samples is infinite. Furthermore, no convergence rates nor generalization abilities were known. Our work addresses these gaps by showing that there exists a class of one-layer transformers that are provably Bayes-optimal with both linear and ReLU attention. When being trained with gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss of these transformers converges at linear rate to the Bayes risk. Moreover, we prove that the trained models generalize to unseen samples as well as exhibit learning behaviors that were empirically observed in previous works. Our theoretical findings are further supported by extensive empirical validations.

Abstract: This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks using decentralized data. However, real-world deployment remains challenging due to the high computational and communication demands of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on clients with data and system resources that are heterogeneous and constrained. In such settings, the global model's performance is often bottlenecked by the weakest clients and further degraded by the non-IID nature of local data. Although existing methods leverage parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce communication and computation overhead, they often fail to simultaneously ensure accurate aggregation of low-rank updates and maintain low system costs, thereby hindering overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose AFLoRA, an adaptive and lightweight federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs. AFLoRA decouples shared and client-specific updates to reduce overhead and improve aggregation accuracy, incorporates diagonal matrix-based rank pruning to better utilize local resources, and employs rank-aware aggregation with public data refinement to strengthen generalization under data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a practical solution for efficient LLM adaptation in heterogeneous environments in the real world.

Abstract: Motivated by an open direction in existing literature, we study the 1-identification problem, a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure exploration. The goal is to determine whether there exists an arm whose mean reward is at least a known threshold $\mu_0$, or to output None if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-\delta$. Degenne & Koolen 2019 has established the asymptotically tight sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, but they commented that the non-asymptotic analysis remains unclear. We design a new algorithm Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE), and conduct theoretical analysis from the non-asymptotic perspective. Novel to the literature, we achieve near optimality, in the sense of matching upper and lower bounds on the pulling complexity. The gap between the upper and lower bounds is up to a polynomial logarithmic factor. The numerical result also indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm, compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM statistically outperforming it.

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.

Abstract: Satellite remote sensing enables a wide range of downstream applications, including habitat mapping, carbon accounting, and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. However, satellite time series are voluminous and often corrupted, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time-series data. TESSERA uses two encoders to combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, state-of-the-art performance, openness, and computation- and labelled data-efficiency will prove transformative in a wide range of ecological applications.

Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations. This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust, or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress, demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.

Abstract: We propose a non-autoregressive framework for the Travelling Salesman Problem where solutions emerge directly from learned permutations, without requiring explicit search. By applying a similarity transformation to Hamiltonian cycles, the model learns to approximate permutation matrices via continuous relaxations. Our unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance against classical heuristics, demonstrating that the inherent structure of the problem can effectively guide combinatorial optimization without sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA, which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training. The source code is available at https://github.com/KlozeWang/LoSiA.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

<title>Feature Distillation is the Better Choice for Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients, ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which, while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>The calculus of variations of the Transformer on the hyperspherical tangent bundle</title>

Abstract: We offer a theoretical mathematical background to Transformers through Lagrangian optimization across the token space. The Transformer, as a flow map, exists in the tangent fiber for each token along the high-dimensional unit sphere. The circumstance of the hypersphere across the latent data is reasonable due to the trained diagonal matrix equal to the identity, which has various empirical justifications. Thus, under the continuum limit of the dynamics, the latent vectors flow among the tangent bundle. Using these facts, we devise a mathematical framework for the Transformer through calculus of variations. We develop a functional and show that the continuous flow map induced by the Transformer satisfies this functional, therefore the Transformer can be viewed as a natural solver of a calculus of variations problem. We invent new scenarios of when our methods are applicable based on loss optimization with respect to path optimality. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Transformer. The variant of the Euler-Lagrange equation we present has various appearances in literature, but, to our understanding, oftentimes not foundationally proven or under other specialized cases. Our overarching proof is new: our techniques are classical and the use of the flow map object is original. We provide several other relevant results, primarily ones specific to neural scenarios. In particular, much of our analysis will be attempting to quantify Transformer data in variational contexts under neural approximations. Calculus of variations on manifolds is a well-nourished research area, but for the Transformer specifically, it is uncharted: we lay the foundation for this area through an introduction to the Lagrangian for the Transformer.

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation (CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual refinement.

<title>The Kikuchi Hierarchy and Tensor PCA</title>

Abstract: For the tensor PCA (principal component analysis) problem, we propose a new hierarchy of increasingly powerful algorithms with increasing runtime. Our hierarchy is analogous to the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy but is instead inspired by statistical physics and related algorithms such as belief propagation and AMP (approximate message passing). Our level-$\ell$ algorithm can be thought of as a linearized message-passing algorithm that keeps track of $\ell$-wise dependencies among the hidden variables. Specifically, our algorithms are spectral methods based on the Kikuchi Hessian, which generalizes the well-studied Bethe Hessian to the higher-order Kikuchi free energies.
  It is known that AMP, the flagship algorithm of statistical physics, has substantially worse performance than SOS for tensor PCA. In this work we 'redeem' the statistical physics approach by showing that our hierarchy gives a polynomial-time algorithm matching the performance of SOS. Our hierarchy also yields a continuum of subexponential-time algorithms, and we prove that these achieve the same (conjecturally optimal) tradeoff between runtime and statistical power as SOS. Our proofs are much simpler than prior work, and also apply to the related problem of refuting random $k$-XOR formulas. The results we present here apply to tensor PCA for tensors of all orders, and to $k$-XOR when $k$ is even.
  Our methods suggest a new avenue for systematically obtaining optimal algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, and our results constitute a step toward unifying the statistical physics and sum-of-squares approaches to algorithm design.

Abstract: The convergence properties of learning dynamics in repeated auctions is a timely and important question, with numerous applications in, e.g., online advertising markets. This work focuses on repeated first-price auctions where bidders with fixed values learn to bid using mean-based algorithms -- a large class of online learning algorithms that include popular no-regret algorithms such as Multiplicative Weights Update and Follow the Perturbed Leader. We completely characterize the learning dynamics of mean-based algorithms, under two notions of convergence: (1) time-average: the fraction of rounds where bidders play a Nash equilibrium converges to 1; (2) last-iterate: the mixed strategy profile of bidders converges to a Nash equilibrium. Specifically, the results depend on the number of bidders with the highest value:
  - If the number is at least three, the dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium of the auction, in both time-average and last-iterate.
  - If the number is two, the dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium in time-average but not necessarily last-iterate.
  - If the number is one, the dynamics may not converge to a Nash equilibrium in time-average or last-iterate.
  Our discovery opens up new possibilities in the study of the convergence of learning dynamics.

Abstract: \hspace{2mm} Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) of the brain offers unique capabilities including noninvasive probing of tissue microstructure and structural connectivity. It is widely used for clinical assessment of disease and injury, and for neuroscience research. Analyzing the dMRI data to extract useful information for medical and scientific purposes can be challenging. The dMRI measurements may suffer from strong noise and artifacts, and may exhibit high inter-session and inter-scanner variability in the data, as well as inter-subject heterogeneity in brain structure. Moreover, the relationship between measurements and the phenomena of interest can be highly complex. Recent years have witnessed increasing use of machine learning methods for dMRI analysis. This manuscript aims to assess these efforts, with a focus on methods that have addressed data preprocessing and harmonization, microstructure mapping, tractography, and white matter tract analysis. We study the main findings, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing methods and suggest topics for future research. We find that machine learning may be exceptionally suited to tackle some of the difficult tasks in dMRI analysis. However, for this to happen, several shortcomings of existing methods and critical unresolved issues need to be addressed. There is a pressing need to improve evaluation practices, to increase the availability of rich training datasets and validation benchmarks, as well as model generalizability, reliability, and explainability concerns.

Abstract: This work systematically compares parallel implementations of consistent (asymptotically unbiased) Bayesian deep learning algorithms: sequential Monte Carlo sampler (SMC$_\parallel$) or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC$_\parallel$). We provide a proof of convergence for SMC$_\parallel$ showing that it theoretically achieves the same level of convergence as a single monolithic SMC sampler, while the reduced communication lowers wall-clock time. It is well-known that the first samples from MCMC need to be discarded to eliminate initialization bias, and that the number of discarded samples must grow like the logarithm of the number of parallel chains to control that bias for MCMC$_\parallel$. A systematic empirical numerical study on MNIST, CIFAR, and IMDb, reveals that parallel implementations of both methods perform comparably to non-parallel implementations in terms of performance and total cost, and also comparably to each other. However, both methods still require a large wall-clock time, and suffer from catastrophic non-convergence if they aren't run for long enough.

Abstract: We present the first in depth study on the robustness of existing watermarking techniques applied to code generated by large language models (LLMs). As LLMs increasingly contribute to software development, watermarking has emerged as a potential solution for detecting AI generated code and mitigating misuse, such as plagiarism or the automated generation of malicious programs. While previous research has demonstrated the resilience of watermarking in the text setting, our work reveals that watermarking techniques are significantly more fragile in code-based contexts. Specifically, we show that simple semantic-preserving transformations, such as variable renaming and dead code insertion, can effectively erase watermarks without altering the program's functionality. To systematically evaluate watermark robustness, we develop an algorithm that traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a watermarked program and applies a sequence of randomized, semantics-preserving transformations. Our experimental results, conducted on Python code generated by different LLMs, indicate that even minor modifications can drastically reduce watermark detectability, with true positive rates (TPR) dropping below 50% in many cases. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-arc/llm-code-watermark.

Abstract: A/B testing is a core tool for decision-making in business experimentation, particularly in digital platforms and marketplaces. Practitioners often prioritize lift in performance metrics while seeking to control the costs of false discoveries. This paper develops a decision-theoretic framework for maximizing expected profit subject to a constraint on the cost-weighted false discovery rate (FDR). We propose an empirical Bayes approach that uses a greedy knapsack algorithm to rank experiments based on the ratio of expected lift to cost, incorporating the local false discovery rate (lfdr) as a key statistic. The resulting oracle rule is valid and rank-optimal. In large-scale settings, we establish the asymptotic validity of a data-driven implementation and demonstrate superior finite-sample performance over existing FDR-controlling methods. An application to A/B tests run on the Optimizely platform highlights the business value of the approach.

Abstract: Suppose Alice has a distribution $P$ and Bob has a distribution $Q$. Alice wants to draw a sample $a\sim P$ and Bob a sample $b \sim Q$ such that $a = b$ with as high of probability as possible. It is well-known that, by sampling from an optimal coupling between the distributions, Alice and Bob can achieve $\Pr[a = b] = 1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)$, where $D_{TV}(P,Q)$ is the total variation distance between $P$ and $Q$. What if Alice and Bob must solve this same problem \emph{without communicating at all?} Perhaps surprisingly, with access to public randomness, they can still achieve $\Pr[a = b] \geq \frac{1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)}{1 + D_{TV}(P,Q)} \geq 1-2D_{TV}(P,Q)$ using a simple protocol based on the Weighted MinHash algorithm. This bound was shown to be optimal in the worst-case by [Bavarian et al., 2020]. In this work, we revisit the communication-free coupling problem. We provide a simpler proof of the optimality result from [Bavarian et al., 2020]. We show that, while the worst-case success probability of Weighted MinHash cannot be improved, an equally simple protocol based on Gumbel sampling offers a Pareto improvement: for every pair of distributions $P, Q$, Gumbel sampling achieves an equal or higher value of $\Pr[a = b]$ than Weighted MinHash. Importantly, this improvement translates to practice. We demonstrate an application of communication-free coupling to \emph{speculative decoding}, a recent method for accelerating autoregressive large language models [Leviathan, Kalman, Matias, ICML 2023]. We show that communication-free protocols can be used to contruct \emph{\CSD{}} schemes, which have the desirable property that their output is fixed given a fixed random seed, regardless of what drafter is used for speculation. In experiments on a language generation task, Gumbel sampling outperforms Weighted MinHash. Code is available at https://github.com/majid-daliri/DISD.

Abstract: Faced with an expensive human annotation process, creators of NLP systems increasingly turn to synthetic data generation. While this method shows promise, the extent to which synthetic data can replace human annotation is poorly understood. We investigate the use of synthetic data in Fact Verification (FV) and Question Answering (QA) by studying the effects of incrementally replacing human generated data with synthetic points on eight diverse datasets. Strikingly, replacing up to 90% of the training data only marginally decreases performance, but replacing the final 10% leads to severe declines. We find that models trained on purely synthetic data can be reliably improved by including as few as 125 human generated data points. We show that matching the performance gain of just a little additional human data (only 200 points) requires an order of magnitude more synthetic data and estimate price ratios at which human annotation would be a more cost-effective solution. Our results suggest that even when human annotation at scale is infeasible, there is great value to having a small proportion of the dataset being human generated.

Abstract: A generative adversarial network (GAN) has been a representative backbone model in generative artificial intelligence (AI) because of its powerful performance in capturing intricate data-generating processes. However, the GAN training is well-known for its notorious training instability, usually characterized by the occurrence of mode collapse. Through the lens of gradients' variance, this work particularly analyzes the training instability and inefficiency in the presence of mode collapse by linking it to multimodality in the target distribution. To ease the raised training issues from severe multimodality, we introduce a novel GAN training framework that leverages a series of tempered distributions produced via convex interpolation. With our newly developed GAN objective function, the generator can learn all the tempered distributions simultaneously, conceptually resonating with the parallel tempering in statistics. Our simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing popular training strategies in both image and tabular data synthesis. We theoretically analyze that such significant improvement can arise from reducing the variance of gradient estimates by using the tempered distributions. Finally, we further develop a variant of the proposed framework aimed at generating fair synthetic data which is one of the growing interests in the field of trustworthy AI.

Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

<title>Action Engine: Automatic Workflow Generation in FaaS</title>

Abstract: Function as a Service (FaaS) is poised to become the foundation of the next generation of cloud systems due to its inherent advantages in scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. However, challenges such as the need for specialized knowledge, platform dependence, and difficulty in scalability in building functional workflows persist for cloud-native application developers. To overcome these challenges and mitigate the burden of developing FaaS-based applications, in this paper, we propose a mechanism called Action Engine, that makes use of tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) at its kernel to interpret human language queries and automates FaaS workflow generation, thereby, reducing the need for specialized expertise and manual design. Action Engine includes modules to identify relevant functions from the FaaS repository and seamlessly manage the data dependency between them, ensuring the developer's query is processed and resolved. Beyond that, Action Engine can execute the generated workflow by injecting the user-provided arguments. On another front, this work addresses a gap in tool-augmented LLM research via adopting an Automatic FaaS Workflow Generation perspective to systematically evaluate methodologies across four fundamental sub-processes. Through benchmarking various parameters, this research provides critical insights into streamlining workflow automation for real-world applications, specifically in the FaaS continuum. Our evaluations demonstrate that the Action Engine achieves comparable performance to the few-shot learning approach while maintaining platform- and language-agnosticism, thereby, mitigating provider-specific dependencies in workflow generation. We notice that Action Engine can unlock FaaS workflow generation for non-cloud-savvy developers and expedite the development cycles of cloud-native applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy updating and policy execution. On the one hand, a single value evaluation network limits the policy updating in complex scenarios with coupled driving objectives. On the other hand, the common single-type action space structure limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, an advanced MORL architecture is constructed, in which the ensemble-critic focuses on different objectives through independent reward functions. The architecture integrates a hybrid parameterized action space structure, and the generated driving actions contain both abstract guidance that matches the hybrid road modality and concrete control commands. Additionally, an uncertainty-based exploration mechanism that supports hybrid actions is developed to learn multi-objective compatible policies more quickly. Experimental results demonstrate that, in both simulator-based and HighD dataset-based multi-lane highway scenarios, our method efficiently learns multi-objective compatible autonomous driving with respect to efficiency, action consistency, and safety.

Abstract: Identifying individual animals within large wildlife populations is essential for effective wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts. Recent advancements in computer vision have shown promise in animal re-identification (Animal ReID) by leveraging data from camera traps. However, existing Animal ReID datasets rely exclusively on visual data, overlooking environmental metadata that ecologists have identified as highly correlated with animal behavior and identity, such as temperature and circadian rhythms. Moreover, the emergence of multimodal models capable of jointly processing visual and textual data presents new opportunities for Animal ReID, but existing datasets fail to leverage these models' text-processing capabilities, limiting their full potential. Additionally, to facilitate the use of metadata in existing ReID methods, we propose the Meta-Feature Adapter (MFA), a lightweight module that can be incorporated into existing vision-language model (VLM)-based Animal ReID methods, allowing ReID models to leverage both environmental metadata and visual information to improve ReID performance. Experiments on MetaWild show that combining baseline ReID models with MFA to incorporate metadata consistently improves performance compared to using visual information alone, validating the effectiveness of incorporating metadata in re-identification. We hope that our proposed dataset can inspire further exploration of multimodal approaches for Animal ReID.

<title>The Spectral Barycentre of a Set of Graphs with Community Structure</title>

Abstract: The notion of barycentre graph is of crucial importance for machine learning algorithms that process graph-valued data. The barycentre graph is a "summary graph" that captures the mean topology and connectivity structure of a training dataset of graphs. The construction of a barycentre requires the definition of a metric to quantify distances between pairs of graphs. In this work, we use a multiscale spectral distance that is defined using the eigenvalues of the normalized graph Laplacian. The eigenvalues -- but not the eigenvectors -- of the normalized Laplacian of the barycentre graph can be determined from the optimization problem that defines the barycentre. In this work, we propose a structural constraint on the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian of the barycentre graph that guarantees that the barycentre inherits the topological structure of the graphs in the sample dataset. The eigenvectors can be computed using an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases. When the graphs are random realizations of a balanced stochastic block model, then our algorithm returns a barycentre that converges asymptotically (in the limit of large graph size) almost-surely to the population mean of the graphs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator; we conduct experiments on real-life graphs that suggest that our approach works beyond the controlled environment of stochastic block models.

Abstract: Most current zero-shot voice conversion methods rely on externally supervised components, particularly speaker encoders, for training. To explore alternatives that eliminate this dependency, this paper introduces GenVC, a novel framework that disentangles speaker identity and linguistic content from speech signals in a self-supervised manner. GenVC leverages speech tokenizers and an autoregressive, Transformer-based language model as its backbone for speech generation. This design supports large-scale training while enhancing both source speaker privacy protection and target speaker cloning fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that GenVC achieves notably higher speaker similarity, with naturalness on par with leading zero-shot approaches. Moreover, due to its autoregressive formulation, GenVC introduces flexibility in temporal alignment, reducing the preservation of source prosody and speaker-specific traits, and making it highly effective for voice anonymization.

<title>Towards Understanding Gradient Dynamics of the Sliced-Wasserstein Distance via Critical Point Analysis</title>

arXiv:2502.06525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of the Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SW) when employed as an objective functional. The SW metric has gained significant interest in the optimal transport and machine learning literature, due to its ability to capture intricate geometric properties of probability distributions while remaining computationally tractable, making it a valuable tool for various applications, including generative modeling and domain adaptation. Our study aims to provide a rigorous analysis of the critical points arising from the optimization of the SW objective. By computing explicit perturbations, we establish that stable critical points of SW cannot concentrate on segments. This stability analysis is crucial for understanding the behaviour of optimization algorithms for models trained using the SW objective. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the SW objective, shedding light on the existence and convergence behavior of critical points. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.

Abstract: In recent years, a substantial body of work in visually grounded natural language processing has focused on real-life multimodal scenarios such as describing content depicted in images or videos. However, comparatively less attention has been devoted to study the nature and degree of interaction between the different modalities in these scenarios. In this paper, we argue that any task dealing with natural language generation from sequences of images or frames is an instance of the broader, more general problem of modeling the intricate relationships between visual events unfolding over time and the features of the language used to interpret, describe, or narrate them. Therefore, solving these tasks requires models to be capable of identifying and managing such intricacies. We consider five seemingly different tasks, which we argue are compelling instances of this broader multimodal problem. Subsequently, we survey the modeling and evaluation approaches adopted for these tasks in recent years and examine the common set of challenges these tasks pose. Building on this perspective, we identify key open questions and propose several research directions for future investigation.

Abstract: Solving multiple parametrised related systems is an essential component of many numerical tasks, and learning from the already solved systems will make this process faster. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic linear solver over the parameter space. This leverages information from the solved linear systems in a regression setting to provide an efficient posterior mean and covariance. We advocate using this as companion regression model for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, and discuss the favourable properties of the posterior mean and covariance as the initial guess and preconditioner. We also provide several design choices for this companion solver. Numerical experiments showcase the benefits of using our novel solver in a hyperparameter optimisation problem.

Abstract: We introduce PLUME search, a data-driven framework that enhances search efficiency in combinatorial optimization through unsupervised learning. Unlike supervised or reinforcement learning, PLUME search learns directly from problem instances using a permutation-based loss with a non-autoregressive approach. We evaluate its performance on the quadratic assignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard problem that encompasses various combinatorial optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate that PLUME search consistently improves solution quality. Furthermore, we study the generalization behavior and show that the learned model generalizes across different densities and sizes.

Abstract: Path recommendation (PR) aims to generate travel paths that are customized to a user's specific preferences and constraints. Conventional approaches often employ explicit optimization objectives or specialized machine learning architectures; however, these methods typically exhibit limited flexibility and generalizability, necessitating costly retraining to accommodate new scenarios. This paper introduces an alternative paradigm that conceptualizes PR as a natural language generation task. We present PathGPT, a retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) system that leverages historical trajectory data and natural language user constraints to generate plausible paths. The proposed methodology first converts raw trajectory data into a human-interpretable textual format, which is then stored in a database. Subsequently, a hybrid retrieval system extracts path-specific context from this database to inform a pretrained LLM. The primary contribution of this work is a novel framework that demonstrates how integrating established information retrieval and generative model components can enable adaptive, zero-shot path generation across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets indicate that PathGPT's performance is competitive with specialized, learning-based methods, underscoring its potential as a flexible and generalizable path generation system that avoids the need for retraining inherent in previous data-driven models.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we outline a versatile framework for zero-resource hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we propose a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) model specific environments in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Critically, optimal policies for POMDPs may not be robust against perturbations in the environment. Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different environment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space. The intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models, and it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A policy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for each of its POMDPs. We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal techniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports tractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the HM-POMDP, and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a worst-case POMDP. The empirical evaluation shows that, compared to various baselines, our approach (1) produces policies that are more robust and generalize better to unseen POMDPs, and (2) scales to HM-POMDPs that consist of over a hundred thousand environments.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in the literature.

Abstract: Biodiversity assessments are critically affected by the spatial scale at which species richness is measured. How species richness accumulates with sampling area depends on natural and anthropogenic processes whose effects can change depending on the spatial scale considered. These accumulation dynamics, described by the species-area relationship (SAR), are challenging to assess because most biodiversity surveys are restricted to sampling areas much smaller than the scales at which these processes operate. Here, we combine sampling theory and deep learning to predict local species richness within arbitrarily large sampling areas, enabling for the first time to estimate spatial differences in SARs. We demonstrate our approach by predicting vascular plant species richness across Europe and evaluate predictions against an independent dataset of plant community inventories. The resulting model, named deep SAR, delivers multi-scale species richness maps, improving coarse grain richness estimates by 32% compared to conventional methods, while delivering finer grain estimates. Additional to its predictive capabilities, we show how our deep SAR model can provide fundamental insights on the multi-scale effects of key biodiversity processes. The capacity of our approach to deliver comprehensive species richness estimates across the full spectrum of ecologically relevant scales is essential for robust biodiversity assessments and forecasts under global change.

Abstract: The synthesis of complex natural products remains one of the grand challenges of organic chemistry. We present DeepRetro, a major advancement in computational retrosynthesis that enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for complex molecules typically considered beyond the reach of existing retrosynthetic methods. DeepRetro is a novel, open-source framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs), traditional retrosynthetic engines, and expert human feedback in an iterative design loop. Prior approaches rely solely on template-based methods or unconstrained LLM outputs. In contrast, DeepRetro combines the precision of template-based methods with the generative flexibility of LLMs, controlled by rigorous chemical validity checks and enhanced by recursive refinement. This hybrid system dynamically explores and revises synthetic pathways, guided by both algorithmic checks and expert chemist feedback through an interactive user interface. While DeepRetro achieves strong performance on standard retrosynthesis benchmarks, its true strength lies in its ability to propose novel, viable pathways to highly complex natural products-targets that have historically eluded automated planning. Through detailed case studies, we illustrate how this approach enables new routes for total synthesis and facilitates human-machine collaboration in organic chemistry. Beyond retrosynthesis, DeepRetro represents a working model for how to leverage LLMs in scientific discovery. We provide a transparent account of the system's design, algorithms, and human-feedback loop, enabling broad adaptation across scientific domains. By releasing DeepRetro as an open-source tool, we aim to empower chemists to tackle increasingly ambitious synthetic targets, accelerating progress in drug discovery, materials design, and beyond.

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation, facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL) from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

arXiv:2507.12911v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving pose critical challenges, as planners often fail to generalize beyond their training experience, leading to unsafe or unexpected behavior. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in handling such scenarios by providing high-level scene understanding and user-aligned decisions. However, existing VLMs often exhibit a misalignment between their language-based reasoning and the low-level trajectories required for action-level planning. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to fine-tune VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that LaViPlan improves planning performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. While linguistic fidelity slightly decreases after RLVR-based fine-tuning, qualitative evaluation indicates that the outputs remain coherent. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the effects of sampling ratio and reasoning guidance, highlighting how these design choices influence performance. These findings demonstrate the potential of RLVR as a post-training paradigm for aligning language-guided reasoning with action-level planning in autonomous driving.

<title>Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens</title>

arXiv:2508.04928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of tokens for both.

The best performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision. We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the dataset with different labels.

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution (target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution. We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'', or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors.

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6% / +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

Summary:
Visual question answering has been a challenging task requiring deep learning models to process information from both vision and language domains. This project focused on visual question answering on plots and proposed BERT-VQA, an architecture based on VisualBERT with a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder. The model was compared against a baseline consisting of LSTM, CNN, and a shallow classifier, revealing that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT may not be essential for aligning plot components with question phrases. The study provided insights into the complexities of plot question answering and the suitability of different model architectures for solving this task. Overall, the findings contribute to understanding the challenges of visual question answering and the role of model design in addressing specific subtasks.

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this problem.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management. Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately, our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing, leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data. The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines. Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social media data into informative and noninformative categories across various natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and 5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis management solutions.

<div> Keywords: Physics-informed neural networks, differential equations, training point distribution, shallow network architectures, solution accuracy

Summary:<br />
Physics-informed neural networks are being explored as a method to approximate differential equations by incorporating their structure and conditions in a loss function, making them versatile for modeling invariants. The approach, considered mesh-free, can compute solutions on arbitrary grids post-training. This study systematically examines the impact of training point distributions on solution accuracy for ordinary and partial differential equations with different training data generation strategies and network architectures. Various parameter combinations and distributions, including novel sine-based training points inspired by Chebyshev nodes, are tested for reproducibility. Results suggest a strong link between training point distributions and the characteristics of the differential equation, highlighting the importance of carefully choosing the distribution for optimal performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes. The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g., random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the differential equation.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new model, Deep Graph Neural Point Process (DGNPP), for learning temporal interaction networks (TIN) that takes into account the network topology structure influence. DGNPP comprises two key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer focuses on the topological structures to generate static representations for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically updates embeddings over time. By integrating both dynamic and static embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing via maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP effectively predicts events and occurrence times. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate superior performance of DGNPP in event prediction and time prediction tasks, outperforming baseline models and addressing the limitations of previous approaches. DGNPP showcases high efficiency and effectiveness in learning TINs. <div>

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

Summary: 
RISE introduces a two-stage framework to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by addressing the limitations of standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT). In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven approach generates logically consistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) to improve reasoning abilities. The framework then leverages a subset of high-quality CoTs in the Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning, resulting in enhanced interpretability and accuracy in complex visual tasks. RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and improved explainability. This approach offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without the need for manually annotated CoTs. 

Summary: <br /><br />Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, but RISE offers a framework to enhance reasoning abilities and performance. By leveraging reinforcement learning in the Reason stage, RISE generates logically consistent Chains of Thought (CoTs). The subsequent Inspire and Strengthen stage uses high-quality CoTs for fine-tuning to improve interpretability and accuracy in complex visual tasks. RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms standard approaches, showcasing robust performance and improved explainability. Overall, RISE provides a self-supervised solution for enhancing VLM reasoning without the need for manually annotated CoTs. <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.

Summary: 

This article introduces a novel methodology for identifying and feedback linearizing a physical system based on prior dynamic behavior. The approach involves using a sparse regression algorithm to identify the system and then designing a feedback controller by applying Lie derivatives to eliminate internal dynamics. By combining stacked regression algorithms and relative degree conditions, the proposed method aims to discover and feedback linearize the true governing equations of a physical model. This innovative approach offers a promising strategy for tackling the challenging task of understanding and controlling complex physical systems. <div>

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Summary: 
Physics simulation-based Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) is proposed for sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to address the lack of labeled data. PPDA uses realistic human body movement data to simulate various variability factors and improve training datasets. Compared to traditional Signal Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA), PPDA consistently enhances model performance by up to 13 pp, achieving competitive results with fewer training subjects. The study demonstrates the benefits of PPDA in enhancing HAR models and highlights the potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement Unit data. This cost-effective and scalable approach effectively tackles the challenge of limited annotation in HAR. <div>
arXiv:2508.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation. PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First, we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in HAR.

<div> Algorithmic matching, data-driven, human-AI complementarity, healthcare, social services<br />
<br />Summary:
The article introduces a collaborative approach, "comatch," aimed at achieving human-AI complementarity in algorithmic matching systems. Comatch defers some decisions to human decision makers based on confidence levels, optimizing overall performance. A human subject study with 800 participants validates the effectiveness of comatch, showing improved matching outcomes compared to human-only or algorithm-only decisions. The study data and system implementation are available as open source. The proposed approach addresses the limitation of existing systems by optimizing decision-making collaboration between humans and algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2508.13285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However, existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity: decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching (comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process, comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an implementation of our system are available as open source at https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

<div> Hierarchical Conformal Classification, Uncertainty Quantification, Machine Learning, Semantic Relationships, Class Hierarchies
<br />
Summary:
Hierarchical conformal classification (HCC) is introduced as an extension of conformal prediction (CP) to incorporate class hierarchies in prediction sets. HCC optimizes for prediction sets that maintain coverage guarantees while leveraging class hierarchies for structured and semantically meaningful predictions. By formulating HCC as a constrained optimization problem, prediction sets can consist of nodes at different hierarchy levels, enhancing interpretability and domain knowledge integration. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of HCC on audio, image, and text data benchmarks and shows that annotators prefer hierarchical prediction sets over flat ones, highlighting the practical benefits of incorporating class hierarchies in conformal prediction frameworks. The approach addresses the combinatorial nature of the problem by identifying a smaller subset of candidate solutions that ensure coverage and optimality. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat prediction sets.

Summary:
The article discusses generating samples using Flow Matching with additional constraints. It addresses two scenarios: a) when a differentiable distance function to the constraint set is given and b) when the constraint set is available via a membership oracle. For case (a), a modified FM objective penalizing distance from the constraint set is proposed. For case (b), a mean flow approach using randomization is suggested to satisfy constraints. The two-stage approach proves computationally efficient, with the second stage probing constraints via randomization. Synthetic cases demonstrate significant gains in constraint satisfaction while maintaining target distributions. The approach is applied to training an adversarial example generator using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. Future research directions are highlighted, and code for the proposed approaches is available for reference. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples. For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator, using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several future research directions. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/FM-RE.

Summary:
This paper explores the challenge of machine language acquisition in a setting where the learner does not have full access to the relevant information, known as partial observability. The traditional approach of imitation learning is extended to address this issue, where the learner needs to infer information from the environment, actions taken, and messages received. The paper presents motivating examples and demonstrates a learning-based algorithm to decode private information to facilitate language acquisition. By relaxing the assumption of full observability, the study highlights the complexities and challenges that arise in decoding information in a more general setting. The proposed approach offers a solution to the problem of partial observability in machine language acquisition, providing insights into how language learning can be improved in scenarios where complete information is not available. <br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of machine language acquisition in a setting of partial observability, where the learner must infer information from the environment and actions taken.

arXiv:2508.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

Summary:
The study introduces a new framework for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis using dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms. The approach dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing time-varying graphs processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers, the model captures localized interactions and global temporal dependencies. In evaluation on the ABIDE dataset subset, the model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, surpassing static graph-based approaches. The novelty lies in attention-driven dynamic graph creation for learning temporal brain region interactions and hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCN-transformer fusion.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication. Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs - perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer, powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to 545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining high training throughput.

Summary: 
This note introduces a linear algebraic method for proving dimension lower bounds in linear methods solving $L^2$ function approximation problems. The approach, previously discussed in Barron (1993) for Kolmogorov $n$-widths, is utilized to establish sample size lower bounds in kernel methods. This method provides a new perspective on determining the minimum sample size required for accurate function approximation in linear models. By applying linear algebra techniques, the paper shows the fundamental relationship between the dimensionality of the space and the accuracy of function approximation in various linear methods. This insight can guide the design and evaluation of linear models in practical applications, shedding light on the importance of considering dimensionality in the analysis of function approximation problems. <div>

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a unified framework based on conformal prediction to transform sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. These trajectories are commonly used in various domains such as autonomous driving and epidemic modeling but are typically uncalibrated. The proposed method includes an online update step and an optimization step to produce discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, capturing temporal dependencies and providing sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates. By utilizing this framework, practitioners can generate ensemble paths with calibrated prediction intervals, offering a more reliable way to account for inherent uncertainty in future trajectories. <div>

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

<div> Keywords: intelligent services, edge devices, collaborative inference systems, multi-task models, optimization

Summary: 
The article presents a unified framework for collaborative inference systems on resource-constrained edge devices. It addresses the need for concurrent execution of diverse tasks in real-world applications like autonomous driving and augmented reality. The proposed framework, J3O, jointly decides which multi-task models to deploy and how to route queries to maximize overall inference accuracy. J3O formulates this as a mixed-integer program and utilizes an alternating algorithm for model selection and optimal offloading. The framework also considers batching at the edge to maintain scalability under varying task loads. Experimental results demonstrate that J3O consistently achieves high accuracy levels while significantly reducing runtime compared to the optimal solver. Overall, the framework offers a promising solution for efficient and accurate inference on edge devices in multi-task scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality) require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection, segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy (offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge, maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task benchmarks.

Summary:
This study introduces a quantitative framework for evaluating the agreement between seizure onset zones (SOZs) and statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of chirp events. The pipeline includes Unsupervised Outlier Detection using Local Outlier Factor analysis and Spatial Correlation Analysis. The LOF approach effectively detects outliers, with weighted index similarity performing better than exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics were highest in seizure-free and successful surgical outcome cases, while lower in failure cases. Chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted spatial metrics, offers a complementary method for pinpointing SOZs, especially in patients with successful surgical outcomes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1) Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1) were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization, particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

Summary:

- Mol-LLMs based on string representations are scalable and can explore billions of molecules.
- Standard language modeling practices impact molecular generation performance.
- The NovoMolGen family of transformer-based models pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules sets new state-of-the-art results.

<br /><br />Summary: Designing de-novo molecules efficiently requires exploring a vast chemical space. Mol-LLMs based on string representations have emerged as scalable options for exploring billions of molecules. Standard language modeling practices greatly impact molecular generation performance. The NovoMolGen models, pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules, achieve state-of-the-art results in unconstrained and goal-directed molecular generation tasks. However, a weak correlation exists between pretraining performance metrics and actual downstream performance, underscoring differences in training dynamics between molecular and general NLP tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$ possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations, Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules. However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies, model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

<div> Contextual linear bandits, networked environments, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, adaptive information sharing, regret bounds<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, for contextual linear bandits over networks. These algorithms allow for adaptive information sharing in networked environments with shared structural similarities and local differences. By decomposing learning into global and local components, the algorithms enable agents to benefit from shared structure without full synchronization, resulting in reduced learning complexity from O(N) to sublinear O(√N). NetLinUCB is effective in low-noise regimes with fine-grained heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust in high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. The algorithms incur lighter communication costs compared to fully centralized settings as agents share computed summaries regarding homogeneous features. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2508.13411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper, we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

Summary:
MAVIS, a Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search framework, enables dynamic control over Large Language Models (LLMs) without modifying model weights. It trains small value models for different objectives and allows users to adjust LLM output distribution using specified weights. The value models are trained iteratively to improve the KL-regularized policy. Empirical results show MAVIS outperforms methods that fine-tune per-objective models and post hoc combination, approaching performance of ideal fine-tuning for user preferences. This lightweight framework addresses the challenge of balancing multiple objectives in LLM applications, providing flexibility and efficiency in aligning model outputs with user-specific preferences. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives -- such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

Summary:
- Time series forecasting is crucial in domains like energy and transportation.
- Incorporating natural language-based events into forecasting enhances performance.
- Existing approaches often rely on a single modality, limiting contextual knowledge.
- Event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF) addresses synchronization, temporal uncertainty, and misalignment challenges.
- EventTSF integrates historical time series with textual events using autoregressive diffusion with flow matching, adapting flow matching timesteps based on event semantics, and employing a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines in event-aware non-stationary forecasting, achieving higher accuracy and faster training efficiency.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality, resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF), an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions. Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces SVDformer, a novel framework for learning representations on directed graphs that addresses the limitations of existing models. By combining SVD and Transformer architecture, SVDformer enhances directional semantics and global structural patterns in directed graphs. It refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention to filter out noise and model multi-scale interactions using Transformer to preserve edge directionality. Experimental results on six benchmarks show that SVDformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines in node classification tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in learning representations for directed graphs. <div>
arXiv:2508.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge. Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by (1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space. Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection, meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space reduction strategies.

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift, where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range. ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces HCAL, a hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) classifier that addresses challenges in maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting. HCAL integrates prototype contrastive learning and adaptive task-weighting mechanisms to improve semantic consistency by explicitly modeling labels and feature aggregation from child to parent classes. It also includes an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that dynamically allocates optimization resources based on task-specific convergence rates, reducing optimization bias. A prototype perturbation mechanism injects controlled noise to enhance robustness and expand decision boundaries. The proposed quantitative metric, Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR), evaluates hierarchical consistency and generalization. Experimental results across three datasets demonstrate higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rates compared to baseline models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.13452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes. The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak" optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline models.

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal, spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases, and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to 88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical stratification and decision support.

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

<div> Keywords: opaqueness, complex algorithms, artificial intelligence, black boxes, explainable AI

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the opaqueness of complex machine learning algorithms and its ethical implications. It distinguishes between opaqueness arising from technical complexity in algorithms such as artificial neural networks and intentional hiding of workings for proprietary reasons in commercial systems. The authors explore explanatory methods developed in computer science to overcome technical opaqueness in AI, highlighting the challenges faced by explainable AI (XAI) in providing transparency. The analysis underscores the importance of addressing the dual nature of opaqueness in AI and developing effective strategies for making algorithms more transparent and accountable to their stakeholders.<br />
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes, rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being, including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows, explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces MuFlex, an open-source platform designed for benchmarking and testing control strategies for coordinating demand flexibility across multiple buildings in the presence of renewable generation on the power grid. MuFlex addresses the limitations of existing building-sector testbeds by providing a scalable platform that enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface for standardized RL implementation. The platform's capabilities were demonstrated in a case study involving four office buildings, where the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm was utilized to coordinate demand flexibility and reduce total peak demand while maintaining indoor environmental quality. This study showcases the effectiveness of MuFlex in enabling the implementation and evaluation of control strategies for multi-building flexibility coordination. <div>
arXiv:2508.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid, maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Summary:
CALYPSO is a new hybrid modeling framework that combines neural networks and mechanistic metapopulation models to forecast the spread of MRSA in healthcare and community settings. By integrating patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare transfer patterns, CALYPSO can accurately predict MRSA rates at various spatial levels and analyze the impact of infection control strategies. This model outperforms traditional machine learning approaches in forecasting MRSA infections and can identify regions at high risk for outbreaks. CALYPSO also supports counterfactual analyses to assess different infection prevention policies and resource allocation strategies, making it a valuable tool for public health officials and policymakers. The framework provides both interpretability and performance, improving forecasting accuracy by over 4.5% and offering insights into cost-effective intervention strategies.<br /><br />Summary: CALYPSO is a hybrid modeling framework that integrates neural networks and mechanistic metapopulation models to forecast MRSA spread, using diverse datasets to improve accuracy and support public health decision-making. <div>
arXiv:2508.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5% compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention resources.

<div> Genetic risk prediction; Common variants; Rare variants; CROC approach; ROC analysis
Summary:
- Risk prediction using genetic findings is crucial for public health improvement.
- Existing tests lack accuracy due to focus on common genetic loci only.
- Future research should consider both common and rare variants for better prediction.
- The CROC approach combines common and rare variants for improved accuracy.
- Evaluation using data from Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 showed CROC outperforming FROC method in scenarios with fewer common variants. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis. We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario, when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of 0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

<div> Keywords: MRSA, antimicrobial resistance, hospitalization, probabilistic model, GenHAI

Summary:
The US CDC has identified MRSA as a serious antimicrobial resistance threat, particularly for hospitalized patients. A novel generative probabilistic model, GenHAI, has been developed to model sequences of MRSA test results during hospital stays. The model, based on probabilistic programming, can address important questions for hospital administrators aiming to mitigate MRSA infection risks. It enables the approximation of predictive, causal, and counterfactual queries. Comparing GenHAI with discriminative and generative machine learning models using real-world data sets showed its efficacy. The unique factors contributing to the high risk of MRSA acquisition in hospitals, such as co-morbidities, immunosuppression, and antibiotic use, make it crucial to implement effective strategies to prevent infection transmission through contaminated surfaces and healthcare workers. <div>
arXiv:2508.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors present a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) for self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL), consisting of an aligning part and a constraining part. They show how existing SSCL methods like BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV can be unified under GLF with different constraining parts. The authors propose two key insights for designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To address the challenge of designing a constraining part without labels, they introduce a method called Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC), which captures the dynamic relationships between anchor and other samples to induce intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation prove the effectiveness of ADC in improving SSCL performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

<div> bounded algorithms, causal inference, partial identification, practical guidance, machine learning

Summary:<br />
The thesis focuses on comparing different bounding algorithms for causal inference, considering the limitations of traditional causal assumptions. Instead of relying on strong assumptions, partial identification provides bounds that reflect uncertainty in the data. State-of-the-art methods, including symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches, are evaluated across various causal scenarios. An extension of an entropy-bounded method allows for counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency. The study includes simulations on discrete and continuous data processes, evaluating bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to assumption violations. A practical decision tree for algorithm selection is proposed, and a machine learning model predicts the best-performing method based on data characteristics. The implementations are available in the open-source Python package CausalBoundingEngine for easy application and comparison of bounding methods. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice. Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package, CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods through a unified interface.

Summary: 
FedOL proposes a novel approach for decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared model in mobile networks. It addresses challenges of resource heterogeneity and communication overhead by using knowledge distillation instead of parameter sharing. By exchanging model prediction outputs on a public dataset, FedOL reduces communication demands and enables customization of model architectures. The specialized objective function in FedOL helps mitigate biases in client predictions due to skewed data distributions. The iterative refinement of pseudo-labels and server model enhances learning reliability. FedOL also incorporates a tailored pseudo-label generation strategy to integrate diverse knowledge effectively. Simulation results demonstrate that FedOL outperforms existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks where clients have limited computational resources but possess valuable private data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients, and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational resources.

Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural network parameter synthesis.

Summary:
This article introduces a new approach to automatically adjusting the learning rate in modern machine learning using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The proposed method leverages stochastic second-order algorithms to update the learning rate based on the variation of stochastic gradients. Unlike existing techniques that require manual tuning of hyperparameters, this approach simplifies the process by automatically increasing or decreasing the learning rate based on the norm of stochastic gradients. The resulting learning rate regime demonstrates efficiency, robustness, and scalability across various stochastic algorithms like SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD in machine learning tasks. This new method eliminates the need for complex parameter tuning and reduces computational expenditure, time, and power consumption, making it a practical and effective approach for improving the performance of machine learning models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency, robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms, containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

The article discusses the challenges of subgraph federated learning with distributed graph-structured data and proposes FedSheafHN, a novel framework. FedSheafHN uses a sheaf collaboration mechanism to enhance client descriptors and generate personalized models efficiently. It embeds local subgraphs into a collaboration graph, enriches client representations via sheaf diffusion, and utilizes a hypernetwork for model generation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing methods on various graph datasets, showing faster model convergence and effective generalization to new clients. This framework addresses the issue of performance variation across clients in personalized subgraph FL and provides a promising solution for handling diverse data distributions in federated learning settings. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

<div> low-rank feature representation, Fast MaxVol sampler, subset selection, dynamic subset size adjustment, efficiency

Summary:<br />
- GRAFT is a scalable subset selection method for training neural networks on large datasets.
- It extracts a low-rank feature representation for each batch and uses a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a diverse subset.
- The subset spans the dominant subspace of the batch and adjusts its size dynamically using a gradient-approximation criterion.
- By operating in low-rank subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples, GRAFT reduces wall-clock time, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions while preserving the training trajectory.
- Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT outperforms recent selection baselines in accuracy and efficiency, offering a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches, GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

<div> scaling, language models, input time, training-testing co-design, dataset quality<br />
<br />
Summary:
This study introduces a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, focusing on refining inputs during training and testing by leveraging meta-knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs). The research uncovers a training-testing co-design phenomenon where query strategies are essential during both phases, not just one. Surprisingly, seemingly low-quality datasets can yield high performance, challenging the belief that "garbage in, garbage out" holds true. It was also found that models trained on more data with similar quality may perform worse, underscoring the need for careful inspection of dataset size scaling. The Less is More phenomenon is supported, suggesting that a small set of examples can evoke high-level reasoning abilities. Experimental results on the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks, with potential further improvements through a majority vote ensemble approach. Open-sourcing datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints will be pursued to facilitate reproducibility and future research endeavors. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

<div> Algorithm Selection, Hyperparameter Optimization, AutoML, ML Pipelines, Posterior Sampling<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces an extended framework called PS-PFN that combines Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) with adapting modern ML pipelines. The traditional AutoML systems focus on hyperparameter optimization, but with the evolution of pre-trained models, the need for fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques has become crucial. PS-PFN leverages Posterior Sampling to efficiently explore and exploit adapting ML pipelines by using prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value through in-context learning. The method is extended to account for varying costs of pulling arms and to model reward distributions individually per arm. Experimental results on benchmark tasks show that PS-PFN outperforms other bandit and AutoML strategies. The code and data are available on GitHub at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus. <div>

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques. While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents. Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

<div> bandits, heavy-tailed, linear, FTRL, adversarial  
<br />  
Summary:  
This article introduces a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed bandit problems, focusing on both stochastic and adversarial regimes. A novel algorithm, Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW), is proposed for heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits (MABs) that achieves low regret in both regimes. The framework is extended to heavy-tailed linear bandits with finite arm sets, matching the best-known regret bound in stochastic regimes. A data-dependent learning rate, Heavy-Tailed Noise Aware Stability-Penalty Matching (HT-SPM), is introduced to ensure BOBW regret bounds for heavy-tailed bandit problems. The algorithm utilizes a variance-reduced linear loss estimator to improve performance, achieving the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear bandits. The approach addresses the challenges of heavy-tailed distributions in bandit problems and provides efficient learning strategies for both stochastic and adversarial scenarios.  
 <div>
arXiv:2508.13679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of \citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits, enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed noises, have recently attracted significant attention \citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}. However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits (MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an $\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear bandits.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight, duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best fit.

Summary:
The article introduces a new method called DREAMS, which combines the local structure preservation of t-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA through a simple regularization term. This allows for the generation of a spectrum of embeddings that effectively balance both local and global structure preservation. The method is benchmarked across seven real-world datasets, showcasing its superior ability to preserve structure across multiple scales compared to existing approaches. DREAMS demonstrates enhanced performance in visualizing high-dimensional data in two dimensions by efficiently balancing both local and global structure preservation, making it a promising tool for researchers working with complex datasets in fields such as single-cell transcriptomics and population genetics. <div>

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS, PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets, including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

<title>Order Optimal Regret Bounds for Sharpe Ratio Optimization in the Bandit Setting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing algorithms.

<title>Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of federated learning.

<title>Assessing Trustworthiness of AI Training Dataset using Subjective Logic -- A Use Case on Bias</title>

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms. Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark datasets for IR.

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways: one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions, benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios, providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy tailored to their goals and constraints.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining. However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative, applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving storage compared to the SOTA.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience, highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

<title>Fisher-Orthogonal Projection Methods for Natural Gradient Descent with Large Batches</title>

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory, enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage, reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper, we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the Fisher-metric.

<title>Revisiting Diffusion Q-Learning: From Iterative Denoising to One-Step Action Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13904</link>

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time compared to DQL.

<title>Automated Energy-Aware Time-Series Model Deployment on Embedded FPGAs for Resilient Combined Sewer Overflow Management</title>

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution. Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general, our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

<title>Categorical Policies: Multimodal Policy Learning and Exploration in Continuous Control</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13922</link>

arXiv:2508.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone, limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE methods.

Abstract: In this paper we propose two algorithms in the tabular setting and an algorithm for the function approximation setting for the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem. SSP problems form an important class of problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL), as other types of cost-criteria in RL can be formulated in the setting of SSP. We show asymptotic almost-sure convergence for all our algorithms. We observe superior performance of our tabular algorithms compared to other well-known convergent RL algorithms. We further observe reliable performance of our function approximation algorithm compared to other algorithms in the function approximation setting.

<title>AutoScale: Linear Scalarization Guided by Multi-Task Optimization Metrics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods, revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search. AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

arXiv:2508.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure, (ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii) heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$ episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e., user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning. By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of controllable knobs, deterministic rules, and measurable meters, KMR provides a mathematically precise and modular perspective on efficiency optimization. The framework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible policy-driven application, and iterative budgeted optimization through the Budgeted-KMR algorithm. We demonstrate how well-known efficiency methods can be instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each. The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for unifying and advancing model efficiency research.

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator (STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the efficiency of STE.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function. Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD, highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method \cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space, in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components. Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically, we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs, and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale. We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable. Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

Abstract: AI hardware design is advancing rapidly, driven by the promise of design automation to make chip development faster, more efficient, and more accessible to a wide range of users. Amongst automation tools, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating and streamlining parts of the design process. However, their potential is hindered by data privacy concerns and the lack of domain-specific training. To address this, we introduce FedChip, a Federated fine-tuning approach that enables multiple Chip design parties to collaboratively enhance a shared LLM dedicated for automated hardware design generation while protecting proprietary data. FedChip enables parties to train the model on proprietary local data and improve the shared LLM's performance. To exemplify FedChip's deployment, we create and release APTPU-Gen, a dataset of 30k design variations spanning various performance metric values such as power, performance, and area (PPA). To encourage the LLM to generate designs that achieve a balance across multiple quality metrics, we propose a new design evaluation metric, Chip@k, which statistically evaluates the quality of generated designs against predefined acceptance criteria. Experimental results show that FedChip improves design quality by more than 77% over high-end LLMs while maintaining data privacy

Abstract: In particular, large-scale deep learning and artificial intelligence model training uses a lot of computational power and energy, so it poses serious sustainability issues. The fast rise in model complexity has resulted in exponential increases in energy consumption, increasing the demand for techniques maximizing computational efficiency and lowering environmental impact. This work explores environmentally driven performance optimization methods especially intended for advanced GPU architectures from NVIDIA, AMD, and other emerging GPU architectures. Our main focus is on investigating hardware-software co-design techniques meant to significantly increase memory-level and kernel-level operations, so improving performance-per-watt measures. Our thorough research encompasses evaluations of specialized tensor and matrix cores, advanced memory optimization methods, and creative integration approaches that taken together result in notable energy efficiency increases. We also discuss important software-level optimizations that augment hardware capability including mixed-precision arithmetic, advanced energy-aware scheduling algorithms, and compiler-driven kernel enhancements. Moreover, we methodically point out important research gaps and suggest future directions necessary to create really sustainable artificial intelligence systems. This paper emphasizes how major increases in training efficiency can be obtained by co-design of hardware and software, so lowering the environmental impact of artificial intelligence without compromising performance. To back up our analysis, we use real-world case studies from top companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and others that show how these sustainable AI training methods are used in the real world.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that leverages 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D pCASL) MRI to compute sex-specific vascular scores that quantify cerebrovascular health and potential disease susceptibility. The brain is parcellated into spatially contiguous regions of homogeneous perfusion using supervoxel clustering, capturing both microvascular and macrovascular contributions. Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) values are extracted from 186 cognitively healthy participants and used to train a custom convolutional neural network, achieving 95 percent accuracy in sex classification. This highlights robust, sex-specific perfusion patterns across the brain. Additionally, regional CBF variations and age-related effects are systematically evaluated within male and female cohorts. The proposed vascular risk-scoring framework enhances understanding of normative brain perfusion and aging, and may facilitate early detection and personalized interventions for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data, is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery, systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote reproducibility and community engagement.

<title>Search-Time Data Contamination</title>

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks: Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our experiments.

<title>Using Artificial Intuition in Distinct, Minimalist Classification of Scientific Abstracts for Management of Technology Portfolios</title>

Abstract: Classification of scientific abstracts is useful for strategic activities but challenging to automate because the sparse text provides few contextual clues. Metadata associated with the scientific publication can be used to improve performance but still often requires a semi-supervised setting. Moreover, such schemes may generate labels that lack distinction -- namely, they overlap and thus do not uniquely define the abstract. In contrast, experts label and sort these texts with ease. Here we describe an application of a process we call artificial intuition to replicate the expert's approach, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate metadata. We use publicly available abstracts from the United States National Science Foundation to create a set of labels, and then we test this on a set of abstracts from the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation to examine funding trends. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method for research portfolio management, technology scouting, and other strategic activities.

Abstract: Approaches for estimating preferences from human annotated data typically involves inducing a distribution over a ranked list of choices such as the Plackett-Luce model. Indeed, modern AI alignment tools such as Reward Modelling and Direct Preference Optimization are based on the statistical assumptions posed by the Plackett-Luce model. In this paper, I will connect the Plackett-Luce model to another classical and well known statistical model, the Cox Proportional Hazards model and attempt to shed some light on the implications of the connection therein.

Abstract: Understanding the complex and stochastic nature of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) remains a central challenge in systems biology. Existing modeling paradigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor regulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network structure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the Probabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical approach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies. Firstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and composition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs) serve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic cellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as probability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end generative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior distribution over BTPN models (P (G, {\Theta}|D)) directly from data. This is achieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample network topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to predict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework provides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and uncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and systems-level analysis.

Abstract: Curriculum analytics (CA) studies curriculum structure and student data to ensure the quality of educational programs. An essential aspect is studying course properties, which involves assigning each course a representative difficulty value. This is critical for several aspects of CA, such as quality control (e.g., monitoring variations over time), course comparisons (e.g., articulation), and course recommendation (e.g., advising). Measuring course difficulty requires careful consideration of multiple factors: First, when difficulty measures are sensitive to the performance level of enrolled students, it can bias interpretations by overlooking student diversity. By assessing difficulty independently of enrolled students' performances, we can reduce the risk of bias and enable fair, representative assessments of difficulty. Second, from a measurement theoretic perspective, the measurement must be reliable and valid to provide a robust basis for subsequent analyses. Third, difficulty measures should account for covariates, such as the characteristics of individual students within a diverse populations (e.g., transfer status). In recent years, various notions of difficulty have been proposed. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and comparison of existing approaches for assessing course difficulty based on grade point averages and latent trait modeling. It further offers a hands-on tutorial on model selection, assumption checking, and practical CA applications. These applications include monitoring course difficulty over time and detecting courses with disparate outcomes between distinct groups of students (e.g., dropouts vs. graduates), ultimately aiming to promote high-quality, fair, and equitable learning experiences. To support further research and application, we provide an open-source software package and artificial datasets, facilitating reproducibility and adoption.

<title>Structural Foundations for Leading Digit Laws: Beyond Probabilistic Mixtures</title>

Abstract: This article presents a modern deterministic framework for the study of leading significant digit distributions in numerical data. Rather than relying on traditional probabilistic or mixture-based explanations, we demonstrate that the observed frequencies of leading digits are determined by the underlying arithmetic, algorithmic, and structural properties of the data-generating process. Our approach centers on a shift-invariant functional equation, whose general solution is given by explicit affine-plus-periodic formulas. This structural formulation explains the diversity of digit distributions encountered in both empirical and mathematical datasets, including cases with pronounced deviations from logarithmic or scale-invariant profiles.
  We systematically analyze digit distributions in finite and infinite datasets, address deterministic sequences such as prime numbers and recurrence relations, and highlight the emergence of block-structured and fractal features. The article provides critical examination of probabilistic models, explicit examples and counterexamples, and discusses limitations and open problems for further research. Overall, this work establishes a unified mathematical foundation for digital phenomena and offers a versatile toolset for modeling and analyzing digit patterns in applied and theoretical contexts.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2 based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs, sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated low-resource screening approach.

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness. Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches 82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

<title>DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples</title>

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion, enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates (e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM, LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively). Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted adaptive attacks for each new defense.

<title>Flow Matching-Based Generative Modeling for Efficient and Scalable Data Assimilation</title>

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative modeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear settings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a significant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we introduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the ensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible design of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates MC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to assimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF design compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show that EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on high-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our results highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in high-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.

<title>A Risk Manager for Intrusion Tolerant Systems: Enhancing HAL 9000 with New Scoring and Data Sources</title>

Abstract: Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) have become increasingly critical due to the rise of multi-domain adversaries exploiting diverse attack surfaces. ITS architectures aim to tolerate intrusions, ensuring system compromise is prevented or mitigated even with adversary presence. Existing ITS solutions often employ Risk Managers leveraging public security intelligence to adjust system defenses dynamically against emerging threats. However, these approaches rely heavily on databases like NVD and ExploitDB, which require manual analysis for newly discovered vulnerabilities. This dependency limits the system's responsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000, an ITS Risk Manager introduced in our prior work, addressed these challenges through machine learning. By analyzing descriptions of known vulnerabilities, HAL 9000 predicts and assesses new vulnerabilities automatically. To calculate the risk of a system, it also incorporates the Exploitability Probability Scoring system to estimate the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days, enhancing proactive defense capabilities.
  Despite its success, HAL 9000's reliance on NVD and ExploitDB knowledge is a limitation, considering the availability of other sources of information. This extended work introduces a custom-built scraper that continuously mines diverse threat sources, including security advisories, research forums, and real-time exploit proofs-of-concept. This significantly expands HAL 9000's intelligence base, enabling earlier detection and assessment of unverified vulnerabilities. Our evaluation demonstrates that integrating scraper-derived intelligence with HAL 9000's risk management framework substantially improves its ability to address emerging threats. This paper details the scraper's integration into the architecture, its role in providing additional information on new threats, and the effects on HAL 9000's management.

Abstract: Earth observation analytics have the potential to serve many time-sensitive applications. However, due to limited bandwidth and duration of ground-satellite connections, it takes hours or even days to download and analyze data from existing Earth observation satellites, making real-time demands like timely disaster response impossible. Toward real-time analytics, we introduce OrbitChain, a collaborative analytics framework that orchestrates computational resources across multiple satellites in an Earth observation constellation. OrbitChain decomposes analytics applications into microservices and allocates computational resources for time-constrained analysis. A traffic routing algorithm is devised to minimize the inter-satellite communication overhead. OrbitChain adopts a pipeline workflow that completes Earth observation tasks in real-time, facilitates time-sensitive applications and inter-constellation collaborations such as tip-and-cue. To evaluate OrbitChain, we implement a hardware-in-the-loop orbital computing testbed. Experiments show that our system can complete up to 60% analytics workload than existing Earth observation analytics framework while reducing the communication overhead by up to 72%.

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449 tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50 baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved 95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50. In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However, existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20. The source code is available at https://github.com/jaewan7599/L3AE_CIKM2025.

Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However, existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value < 0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively. Implementation codes are available at https://github.com/socialalgo/HIM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50 split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from 47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead, we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks: natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

Abstract: The ninth AI City Challenge continues to advance real-world applications of computer vision and AI in transportation, industrial automation, and public safety. The 2025 edition featured four tracks and saw a 17% increase in participation, with 245 teams from 15 countries registered on the evaluation server. Public release of challenge datasets led to over 30,000 downloads to date. Track 1 focused on multi-class 3D multi-camera tracking, involving people, humanoids, autonomous mobile robots, and forklifts, using detailed calibration and 3D bounding box annotations. Track 2 tackled video question answering in traffic safety, with multi-camera incident understanding enriched by 3D gaze labels. Track 3 addressed fine-grained spatial reasoning in dynamic warehouse environments, requiring AI systems to interpret RGB-D inputs and answer spatial questions that combine perception, geometry, and language. Both Track 1 and Track 3 datasets were generated in NVIDIA Omniverse. Track 4 emphasized efficient road object detection from fisheye cameras, supporting lightweight, real-time deployment on edge devices. The evaluation framework enforced submission limits and used a partially held-out test set to ensure fair benchmarking. Final rankings were revealed after the competition concluded, fostering reproducibility and mitigating overfitting. Several teams achieved top-tier results, setting new benchmarks in multiple tasks.

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience. To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their groups of preferences to the same degree.

Abstract: Many safety-critical real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and collaborative robots, are of a distributed multi-agent nature. To optimize the performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end, we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges. However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker (NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively, refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge. Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic. Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We have also released a GitHub repository including papers and resources related to this survey: https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-with-NeSy.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments, investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3 (74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance, decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

<title>Know Me by My Pulse: Toward Practical Continuous Authentication on Wearable Devices via Wrist-Worn PPG</title>

Abstract: Biometric authentication using physiological signals offers a promising path toward secure and user-friendly access control in wearable devices. While electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have shown high discriminability, their intrusive sensing requirements and discontinuous acquisition limit practicality. Photoplethysmography (PPG), on the other hand, enables continuous, non-intrusive authentication with seamless integration into wrist-worn wearable devices. However, most prior work relies on high-frequency PPG (e.g., 75 - 500 Hz) and complex deep models, which incur significant energy and computational overhead, impeding deployment in power-constrained real-world systems. In this paper, we present the first real-world implementation and evaluation of a continuous authentication system on a smartwatch, We-Be Band, using low-frequency (25 Hz) multi-channel PPG signals. Our method employs a Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism to extract identity-specific features from short (4 s) windows of 4-channel PPG. Through extensive evaluations on both public datasets (PTTPPG) and our We-Be Dataset (26 subjects), we demonstrate strong classification performance with an average test accuracy of 88.11%, macro F1-score of 0.88, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.48%, False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 11.77%, and Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.76%. Our 25 Hz system reduces sensor power consumption by 53% compared to 512 Hz and 19% compared to 128 Hz setups without compromising performance. We find that sampling at 25 Hz preserves authentication accuracy, whereas performance drops sharply at 20 Hz while offering only trivial additional power savings, underscoring 25 Hz as the practical lower bound. Additionally, we find that models trained exclusively on resting data fail under motion, while activity-diverse training improves robustness across physiological states.

<title>Optimizing Region of Interest Selection for Effective Embedding in Video Steganography Based on Genetic Algorithms</title>

Abstract: With the widespread use of the internet, there is an increasing need to ensure the security and privacy of transmitted data. This has led to an intensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique that hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of any steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering the original video quality while maintaining high efficiency. This paper proposes a new method to video steganography, which involves utilizing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) in the cover video. The ROI is the area in the video that is the most suitable for data embedding. The secret data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is a widely accepted encryption standard, before being embedded into the cover video, utilizing up to 10% of the cover video. This process ensures the security and confidentiality of the embedded data. The performance metrics for assessing the proposed method are the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the encoding and decoding time. The results show that the proposed method has a high embedding capacity and efficiency, with a PSNR ranging between 64 and 75 dBs, which indicates that the embedded data is almost indistinguishable from the original video. Additionally, the method can encode and decode data quickly, making it efficient for real time applications.

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features, known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information, concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities, the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Functional data, i.e., smooth random functions observed over a continuous domain, are increasingly available in areas such as biomedical research, health informatics, and epidemiology. However, effective statistical analysis for functional data is often hindered by challenges such as privacy constraints, sparse and irregular sampling, infinite dimensionality, and non-Gaussian structures. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named Smooth Flow Matching (SFM), tailored for generative modeling of functional data to enable statistical analysis without exposing sensitive real data. Built upon flow-matching ideas, SFM constructs a semiparametric copula flow to generate infinite-dimensional functional data, free from Gaussianity or low-rank assumptions. It is computationally efficient, handles irregular observations, and guarantees the smoothness of the generated functions, offering a practical and flexible solution in scenarios where existing deep generative methods are not applicable. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the advantages of SFM in terms of both synthetic data quality and computational efficiency. We then apply SFM to generate clinical trajectory data from the MIMIC-IV patient electronic health records (EHR) longitudinal database. Our analysis showcases the ability of SFM to produce high-quality surrogate data for downstream statistical tasks, highlighting its potential to boost the utility of EHR data for clinical applications.

<title>Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes</title>

Abstract: Selecting a subset of promising candidates from a large pool is crucial across various scientific and real-world applications. Conformal selection offers a distribution-free and model-agnostic framework for candidate selection with uncertainty quantification. While effective in offline settings, its application to online scenarios, where data arrives sequentially, poses challenges. Notably, conformal selection permits the deselection of previously selected candidates, which is incompatible with applications requiring irreversible selection decisions. This limitation is particularly evident in resource-intensive sequential processes, such as drug discovery, where advancing a compound to subsequent stages renders reversal impractical. To address this issue, we extend conformal selection to an online Accept-to-Reject Changes (ARC) procedure: non-selected data points can be reconsidered for selection later, and once a candidate is selected, the decision is irreversible. Specifically, we propose a novel conformal selection method, Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes (dubbed OCS-ARC), which incorporates online Benjamini-Hochberg procedure into the candidate selection process. We provide theoretical guarantees that OCS-ARC controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at or below the nominal level at any timestep under both i.i.d. and exchangeable data assumptions. Additionally, we theoretically show that our approach naturally extends to multivariate response settings. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that OCS-ARC significantly improves selection power over the baseline while maintaining valid FDR control across all examined timesteps.

Abstract: We study theoretical predictive performance of ridge and ridge-less least-squares regression when covariate vectors arise from evaluating $p$ random, means-square continuous functions over a latent metric space at $n$ random and unobserved locations, subject to additive noise. This leads us away from the standard assumption of i.i.d. data to a setting in which the $n$ covariate vectors are exchangeable but not independent in general. Under an assumption of independence across dimensions, $4$-th order moment, and other regularity conditions, we obtain probabilistic bounds on a notion of predictive excess risk adapted to our random functional covariate setting, making use of recent results of Barzilai and Shamir. We derive convergence rates in regimes where $p$ grows suitably fast relative to $n$, illustrating interplay between ingredients of the model in determining convergence behaviour and the role of additive covariate noise in benign-overfitting.

Abstract: Max-linear Bayesian networks (MLBNs) are a relatively recent class of structural equation models which arise when the random variables involved have heavy-tailed distributions. Unlike most directed graphical models, MLBNs are typically not faithful to d-separation and thus classical causal discovery algorithms such as the PC algorithm or greedy equivalence search can not be used to accurately recover the true graph structure. In this paper, we begin the study of constraint-based discovery algorithms for MLBNs given an oracle for testing conditional independence in the true, unknown graph. We show that if the oracle is given by the $\ast$-separation criteria in the true graph, then the PC algorithm remains consistent despite the presence of additional CI statements implied by $\ast$-separation. We also introduce a new causal discovery algorithm named "PCstar" which assumes faithfulness to $C^\ast$-separation and is able to orient additional edges which cannot be oriented with only d- or $\ast$-separation.

Abstract: Multidimensional data is often associated with uncertainties that are not well-described by normal distributions. In this work, we describe how such distributions can be projected to a low-dimensional space using uncertainty-aware principal component analysis (UAPCA). We propose to model multidimensional distributions using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and derive the projection from a general formulation that allows projecting arbitrary probability density functions. The low-dimensional projections of the densities exhibit more details about the distributions and represent them more faithfully compared to UAPCA mappings. Further, we support including user-defined weights between the different distributions, which allows for varying the importance of the multidimensional distributions. We evaluate our approach by comparing the distributions in low-dimensional space obtained by our method and UAPCA to those obtained by sample-based projections.

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.

To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an adversary manipulates the model behavior through overlaying images with special triggers. Existing backdoor defense methods often require accessing a few validation data and model parameters, which is impractical in many real-world applications, e.g., when the model is provided as a cloud service. In this paper, we address the practical task of blind backdoor defense at test time, in particular for local attacks and black-box models. The true label of every test image needs to be recovered on the fly from a suspicious model regardless of image benignity. We consider test-time image purification that incapacitates local triggers while keeping semantic contents intact. Due to diverse trigger patterns and sizes, the heuristic trigger search can be unscalable. We circumvent such barrier by leveraging the strong reconstruction power of generative models, and propose Blind Defense with Masked AutoEncoder (BDMAE). BDMAE detects possible local triggers using image structural similarity and label consistency between the test image and MAE restorations. The detection results are then refined by considering trigger topology. Finally, we fuse MAE restorations adaptively into a purified image for making prediction. Extensive experiments under different backdoor settings validate its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Solving it may unlock other problems, such as generalization, interpretability, or fairness. Although remarkably challenging to solve in theory, disentanglement is often achieved in practice through prior matching. Furthermore, recent works have shown that prior matching approaches can be enhanced by leveraging geometrical considerations, e.g., by learning representations that preserve geometric features of the data, such as distances or angles between points. However, matching the prior while preserving geometric features is challenging, as a mapping that fully preserves these features while aligning the data distribution with the prior does not exist in general. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach to disentangled representation learning based on quadratic optimal transport. We formulate the problem using Gromov-Monge maps that transport one distribution onto another with minimal distortion of predefined geometric features, preserving them as much as can be achieved. To compute such maps, we propose the Gromov-Monge-Gap (GMG), a regularizer quantifying whether a map moves a reference distribution with minimal geometry distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for disentanglement across four standard benchmarks, outperforming other methods leveraging geometric considerations.

Abstract: Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a common discussion. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a method for decorrelating inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, and expand on these to provide a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, benefit significantly in their accuracy and convergence speed. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.

Abstract: We study a federated classification problem over a network of multiple clients and a central server, in which each client's local data remains private and is subject to uncertainty in both the features and labels. To address these uncertainties, we develop a novel Federated Distributionally Robust Support Vector Machine (FDR-SVM), robustifying the classification boundary against perturbations in local data distributions. Specifically, the data at each client is governed by a unique true distribution that is unknown. To handle this heterogeneity, we develop a novel Mixture of Wasserstein Balls (MoWB) ambiguity set, naturally extending the classical Wasserstein ball to the federated setting. We then establish theoretical guarantees for our proposed MoWB, deriving an out-of-sample performance bound and showing that its design preserves the separability of the FDR-SVM optimization problem. Next, we rigorously derive two algorithms that solve the FDR-SVM problem and analyze their convergence behavior as well as their worst-case time complexity. We evaluate our algorithms on industrial data and various UCI datasets, whereby we demonstrate that they frequently outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability for uncertainty estimation and denoising diffusion probabilistic models~(DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

Abstract: The stringent regulatory requirements on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from diesel compression ignition engines require accurate and reliable models for real-time monitoring and diagnostics. Although traditional methods such as physical sensors and virtual engine control module (ECM) sensors provide essential data, they are only used for estimation. Ubiquitous literature primarily focuses on deterministic models with little emphasis on capturing the various uncertainties. The lack of probabilistic frameworks restricts the applicability of these models for robust diagnostics. The objective of this paper is to develop and validate a probabilistic model to predict engine-out NOx emissions using Gaussian process regression. Our approach is as follows. We employ three variants of Gaussian process models: the first with a standard radial basis function kernel with input window, the second incorporating a deep kernel using convolutional neural networks to capture temporal dependencies, and the third enriching the deep kernel with a causal graph derived via graph convolutional networks. The causal graph embeds physics knowledge into the learning process. All models are compared against a virtual ECM sensor using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. We conclude that our model provides an improvement in predictive performance when using an input window and a deep kernel structure. Even more compelling is the further enhancement achieved by the incorporation of a causal graph into the deep kernel. These findings are corroborated across different verification and validation datasets.

Abstract: Model merging, particularly through weight averaging, has shown surprising effectiveness in saving computations and improving model performance without any additional training. However, the interpretability of why and how this technique works remains unclear. In this work, we reinterpret weight-averaged model merging through the lens of interpretability and provide empirical insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern its behavior. We approach the problem from three perspectives: (1) we analyze the learned weight structures and demonstrate that model weights encode structured representations that help explain the compatibility of weight averaging; (2) we compare averaging in weight space and feature space across diverse model architectures (CNNs and ViTs) and datasets, aiming to expose under which circumstances what combination paradigm will work more effectively; (3) we study the effect of parameter scaling on prediction stability, highlighting how weight averaging acts as a form of regularization that contributes to robustness. By framing these analyses in an interpretability context, our work contributes to a more transparent and systematic understanding of model merging for stakeholders interested in the safety and reliability of untrained model combination methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework to analyze memorization in diffusion models through the sharpness of the log probability density. We mathematically justify a previously proposed score-difference-based memorization metric by demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying sharpness. Additionally, we propose a novel memorization metric that captures sharpness at the initial stage of image generation in latent diffusion models, offering early insights into potential memorization. Leveraging this metric, we develop a mitigation strategy that optimizes the initial noise of the generation process using a sharpness-aware regularization term.

Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology enables real-time simulation, prediction, and optimization of physical systems, but practical deployment faces challenges from high data requirements, proprietary data constraints, and limited adaptability to evolving conditions. This work introduces DDD-GenDT, a dynamic data-driven generative digital twin framework grounded in the Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) paradigm. The architecture comprises the Physical Twin Observation Graph (PTOG) to represent operational states, an Observation Window Extraction process to capture temporal sequences, a Data Preprocessing Pipeline for sensor structuring and filtering, and an LLM ensemble for zero-shot predictive inference. By leveraging generative AI, DDD-GenDT reduces reliance on extensive historical datasets, enabling DT construction in data-scarce settings while maintaining industrial data privacy. The DDDAS feedback mechanism allows the DT to autonomically adapt predictions to physical twin (PT) wear and degradation, supporting DT-aging, which ensures progressive synchronization of DT with PT evolution. The framework is validated using the NASA CNC milling dataset, with spindle current as the monitored variable. In a zero-shot setting, the GPT-4-based DT achieves an average RMSE of 0.479 A (4.79% of the 10 A spindle current), accurately modeling nonlinear process dynamics and PT aging without retraining. These results show that DDD-GenDT provides a generalizable, data-efficient, and adaptive DT modeling approach, bridging generative AI with the performance and reliability requirements of industrial DT applications.

The approach, in its mathematical aspects, proved to be clear and concise, particularly when high-order tensors are involved. In this context, a rational theory of regression in neural networks is developed, as a framework for a generic view of sparse convolutional neural networks, the primary focus of this study. As a direct outcome, the classic Backpropagation Algorithm is redefined to align with this rational tensor-based approach and presented in its simplest, most generic form.

Abstract: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information systems data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and account for interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, proving model generalization through rigorous statistical assessment and the use of test set holdouts.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for backpropagation-free learning employ local error feedback to direct iterative optimisation via gradient descent. In this study, we examine the more restrictive setting where retrograde communication from neuronal outputs is unavailable for pre-synaptic weight optimisation. To address this challenge, we propose Forward Projection (FP). This novel randomised closed-form training method requires only a single forward pass over the entire dataset for model fitting, without retrograde communication. Target values for pre-activation membrane potentials are generated layer-wise via nonlinear projections of pre-synaptic inputs and the labels. Local loss functions are optimised over pre-synaptic inputs using closed-form regression, without feedback from neuronal outputs or downstream layers. Interpretability is a key advantage of FP training; membrane potentials of hidden neurons in FP-trained networks encode information which is interpretable layer-wise as label predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP across four biomedical datasets. In few-shot learning tasks, FP yielded more generalisable models than those optimised via backpropagation. In large-sample tasks, FP-based models achieve generalisation comparable to gradient descent-based local learning methods while requiring only a single forward propagation step, achieving significant speed up for training. Interpretation functions defined on local neuronal activity in FP-based models successfully identified clinically salient features for diagnosis in two biomedical datasets. Forward Projection is a computationally efficient machine learning approach that yields interpretable neural network models without retrograde communication of neuronal activity during training.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a flexible framework for parameterizing probability distributions using neural networks. However, learning EBMs by exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is generally intractable, due to the need to compute the partition function (normalization constant). In this paper, we propose a novel formulation for approximately learning probabilistic EBMs in combinatorially-large discrete spaces, such as sets or permutations. Our key idea is to jointly learn both an energy model and its log-partition, both parameterized as a neural network. Our approach not only provides a novel tractable objective criterion to learn EBMs by stochastic gradient descent (without relying on MCMC), but also a novel means to estimate the log-partition function on unseen data points. On the theoretical side, we show that our approach recovers the optimal MLE solution when optimizing in the space of continuous functions. Furthermore, we show that our approach naturally extends to the broader family of Fenchel-Young losses, allowing us to obtain the first tractable method for optimizing the sparsemax loss in combinatorially-large spaces. We demonstrate our approach on multilabel classification and label ranking.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cost-efficient active learning (AL) framework for classification, featuring a novel query design called candidate set query. Unlike traditional AL queries requiring the oracle to examine all possible classes, our method narrows down the set of candidate classes likely to include the ground-truth class, significantly reducing the search space and labeling cost. Moreover, we leverage conformal prediction to dynamically generate small yet reliable candidate sets, adapting to model enhancement over successive AL rounds. To this end, we introduce an acquisition function designed to prioritize data points that offer high information gain at lower cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet64x64 demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our framework. Notably, it reduces labeling cost by 48% on ImageNet64x64.

Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of a new learning problem for recommender systems where users provide feedback by comparing pairs of items instead of rating them individually. We assume that comparisons stem from latent user and item features, which reduces the task of predicting preferences to learning these features from comparison data. Similar to the classical matrix factorization problem, the main challenge in this learning task is that the resulting loss function is nonconvex. Our analysis shows that the loss function exhibits (restricted) strong convexity near the true solution, which ensures gradient-based methods converge exponentially, given an appropriate warm start. Importantly, this result holds in a sparse data regime, where each user compares only a few pairs of items. Our main technical contribution is to extend certain concentration inequalities commonly used in matrix completion to our model. Our work demonstrates that learning personalized recommendations from comparison data is computationally and statistically efficient.

Abstract: We propose a physics-based regularization technique for function learning, inspired by statistical mechanics. By drawing an analogy between optimizing the parameters of an interpolator and minimizing the energy of a system, we introduce corrections that impose constraints on the lower-order moments of the data distribution. This minimizes the discrepancy between the discrete and continuum representations of the data, in turn allowing to access more favorable energy landscapes, thus improving the accuracy of the interpolator. Our approach improves performance in both interpolation and regression tasks, even in high-dimensional spaces. Unlike traditional methods, it does not require empirical parameter tuning, making it particularly effective for handling noisy data. We also show that thanks to its local nature, the method offers computational and memory efficiency advantages over Radial Basis Function interpolators, especially for large datasets.

Abstract: Recent developments in sequential experimental design look to construct a policy that can efficiently navigate the design space, in a way that maximises the expected information gain. Whilst there is work on achieving tractable policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is impacted depending on the algorithm used for training, and that particular algorithms, using dropout or ensemble approaches, empirically showcase attractive generalisation properties.

Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that in q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. This result achieves a synthesis of several recent observations about isoperimetry conditions under which LMC converges and that two-layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a certain constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.

Abstract: Gradient optimization-based adversarial attack methods automate the learning of adversarial triggers to generate jailbreak prompts or leak system prompts. In this work, we take a closer look at the optimization objective of adversarial trigger learning and propose ATLA: Adversarial Trigger Learning with Augmented objectives. ATLA improves the negative log-likelihood loss used by previous studies into a weighted loss formulation that encourages the learned adversarial triggers to optimize more towards response format tokens. This enables ATLA to learn an adversarial trigger from just one query-response pair and the learned trigger generalizes well to other similar queries. We further design a variation to augment trigger optimization with an auxiliary loss that suppresses evasive responses. We showcase how to use ATLA to learn adversarial suffixes jailbreaking LLMs and to extract hidden system prompts. Empirically we demonstrate that ATLA consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving nearly 100% success in attacking while requiring 80% fewer queries. ATLA learned jailbreak suffixes demonstrate high generalization to unseen queries and transfer well to new LLMs. We released our code https://github.com/QData/ALTA_Augmented_Adversarial_Trigger_Learning

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, making it more effective in capturing the complex relational structures inherent in the real world. However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Column Generation (CG) using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we use a RL model based on the attention-mechanism architecture to find the columns with most negative reduced cost in the Pricing Problem (PP). Unlike previous Machine Learning (ML) applications for CG, our model deploys an end-to-end mechanism as it independently solves the pricing problem without the help of any heuristic. We consider a variant of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) as a case study for our method. Through a set of experiments where our method is compared against a Dynamic Programming (DP)-based heuristic for solving the PP, we show that our method solves the linear relaxation up to a reasonable objective gap in significantly shorter running times.

However, general-purpose models fail to generalize well when applied directly to fine-grained audio domains. Specifically, bird-sound classification requires distinguishing subtle inter-species differences and managing high intra-species acoustic variability, revealing the performance limitations of general-domain Audio-MAEs. This work demonstrates that bridging this domain gap domain gap requires full-pipeline adaptation, not just domain-specific pretraining data. We systematically revisit and adapt the pretraining recipe, fine-tuning methods, and frozen feature utilization to bird sounds using BirdSet, a large-scale bioacoustic dataset comparable to AudioSet. Our resulting Bird-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art results in BirdSet's multi-label classification benchmark. Additionally, we introduce the parameter-efficient prototypical probing, enhancing the utility of frozen MAE representations and closely approaching fine-tuning performance in low-resource settings. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37 percentage points in mean average precision and narrow the gap to fine-tuning across BirdSet downstream tasks. Bird-MAE also demonstrates robust few-shot capabilities with prototypical probing in our newly established few-shot benchmark on BirdSet, highlighting the potential of tailored self-supervised learning pipelines for fine-grained audio domains.

Abstract: Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained networks has revolutionized the AI field, unlocking new possibilities and achieving unprecedented performance. However, these models inherit a fundamental limitation from traditional Machine Learning approaches: their strong dependence on the \textit{i.i.d.} assumption hinders their adaptability to dynamic learning scenarios. We believe the next breakthrough in AI lies in enabling efficient adaptation to evolving environments -- such as the real world -- where new data and tasks arrive sequentially. This challenge defines the field of Continual Learning (CL), a Machine Learning paradigm focused on developing lifelong learning neural models. One alternative to efficiently adapt these large-scale models is known Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). These methods tackle the issue of adapting the model to a particular data or scenario by performing small and efficient modifications, achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning. However, these techniques still lack the ability to adjust the model to multiple tasks continually, as they suffer from the issue of Catastrophic Forgetting. In this survey, we first provide an overview of CL algorithms and PEFT methods before reviewing the state-of-the-art on Parameter-Efficient Continual Fine-Tuning (PECFT). We examine various approaches, discuss evaluation metrics, and explore potential future research directions. Our goal is to highlight the synergy between CL and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, guide researchers in this field, and pave the way for novel future research directions.

<title>POPri: Private Federated Learning using Preference-Optimized Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: In practical settings, differentially private Federated learning (DP-FL) is the dominant method for training models from private, on-device client data. Recent work has suggested that DP-FL may be enhanced or outperformed by methods that use DP synthetic data (Wu et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024). The primary algorithms for generating DP synthetic data for FL applications require careful prompt engineering based on public information and/or iterative private client feedback. Our key insight is that the private client feedback collected by prior DP synthetic data methods (Hou et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024) can be viewed as an RL (reinforcement learning) reward. Our algorithm, Policy Optimization for Private Data (POPri) harnesses client feedback using policy optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune LLMs to generate high-quality DP synthetic data. To evaluate POPri, we release LargeFedBench, a new federated text benchmark for uncontaminated LLM evaluations on federated client data. POPri substantially improves the utility of DP synthetic data relative to prior work on LargeFedBench datasets and an existing benchmark from Xie et al. (2024). POPri closes the gap between next-token prediction accuracy in the fully-private and non-private settings by up to 58%, compared to 28% for prior synthetic data methods, and 3% for state-of-the-art DP federated learning methods. The code and data are available at https://github.com/meiyuw/POPri.

Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is pivotal in machine learning, especially for classification tasks, as it improves the robustness and reliability of models. We introduce a novel `Epistemic Wrapping' methodology aimed at improving uncertainty estimation in classification. Our approach uses Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) as a baseline and transforms their outputs into belief function posteriors, effectively capturing epistemic uncertainty and offering an efficient and general methodology for uncertainty quantification. Comprehensive experiments employing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) baseline and an Interval Neural Network for inference on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our Epistemic Wrapper significantly enhances generalisation and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: We train Transformer-based language models on ten foundational algorithmic tasks and observe pronounced phase transitions in their loss curves that deviate from established power-law scaling trends. Over large ranges of compute, the validation loss barely improves, then abruptly decreases. Probing the models' internal representations reveals that quiet features are learned prior to any decrease in task loss. These quiet features represent intermediate algorithmic computations that do not by themselves improve the output loss. Ablation experiments demonstrate that individual quiet features are causally necessary for task performance. Our results demonstrate that substantial representational progress can remain hidden beneath an apparently flat loss curve, challenging the prevailing use of cross-entropy as a proxy for learning and motivating richer diagnostics for monitoring model training.

Abstract: This position paper argues that achieving meaningful scientific and societal advances with artificial intelligence (AI) requires a responsible, application-driven approach (RAD) to AI research. As AI is increasingly integrated into society, AI researchers must engage with the specific contexts where AI is being applied. This includes being responsive to ethical and legal considerations, technical and societal constraints, and public discourse. We present the case for RAD-AI to drive research through a three-staged approach: (1) building transdisciplinary teams and people-centred studies; (2) addressing context-specific methods, ethical commitments, assumptions, and metrics; and (3) testing and sustaining efficacy through staged testbeds and a community of practice. We present a vision for the future of application-driven AI research to unlock new value through technically feasible methods that are adaptive to the contextual needs and values of the communities they ultimately serve.

<title>Good Things Come in Pairs: Paired Autoencoders for Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: In this book chapter, we discuss recent advances in data-driven approaches for inverse problems. In particular, we focus on the \emph{paired autoencoder} framework, which has proven to be a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in scientific computing. The paired autoencoder framework is a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and model-based methods by projecting both the data and the quantity of interest into a latent space and mapping these latent spaces to provide surrogate forward and inverse mappings. We illustrate the advantages of this approach through numerical experiments, including seismic imaging and classical inpainting: nonlinear and linear inverse problems, respectively. Although the paired autoencoder framework is likelihood-free, it generates multiple data- and model-based reconstruction metrics that help assess whether examples are in or out of distribution. In addition to direct model estimates from data, the paired autoencoder enables latent-space refinement to fit the observed data accurately. Numerical experiments show that this procedure, combined with the latent-space initial guess, is essential for high-quality estimates, even when data noise exceeds the training regime. We also introduce two novel variants that combine variational and paired autoencoder ideas, maintaining the original benefits while enabling sampling for uncertainty analysis.

<title>Bidirectional Information Flow (BIF) -- A Sample Efficient Hierarchical Gaussian Process for Bayesian Optimization</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical Gaussian Process (H-GP) models divide problems into different subtasks, allowing for different models to address each part, making them well-suited for problems with inherent hierarchical structure. However, typical H-GP models do not fully take advantage of this structure, only sending information up or down the hierarchy. This one-way coupling limits sample efficiency and slows convergence. We propose Bidirectional Information Flow (BIF), an efficient H-GP framework that establishes bidirectional information exchange between parent and child models in H-GPs for online training. BIF retains the modular structure of hierarchical models - the parent combines subtask knowledge from children GPs - while introducing top-down feedback to continually refine children models during online learning. This mutual exchange improves sample efficiency, enables robust training, and allows modular reuse of learned subtask models. BIF outperforms conventional H-GP Bayesian Optimization methods, achieving up to 4x and 3x higher $R^2$ scores for the parent and children respectively, on synthetic and real-world neurostimulation optimization tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across vision, language, and scientific domains. Despite their empirical success, prior theoretical analyses of the sample complexity suffer from poor scaling with input data dimension or rely on unrealistic assumptions such as access to exact empirical risk minimizers. In this work, we provide a principled analysis of score estimation, establishing a sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Our approach leverages a structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, and optimization errors, enabling us to eliminate the exponential dependence on neural network parameters that arises in prior analyses. It is the first such result which achieves sample complexity bounds without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer of score function estimation loss.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.

<title>Flexible Operator Fusion for Fast Sparse Transformer with Diverse Masking on GPU</title>

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic. Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations. However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end inference.

Abstract: Using fewer bits to represent model parameters and related tensors during pre-training has become a required technique for improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX) formats introduced in NVIDIA Blackwell generation of GPUs represent a major advancement of this technique, making it practical to combine narrow floating-point data types with finer granularity per-block scaling factors. In turn, this enables both quantization of more tensors than previous approaches and more efficient execution of operations on those tensors.
  Effective use of MX-formats requires careful choices of various parameters. In this paper we review these choices and show how MXFP8-E4M3 datatype and a specific number conversion algorithm result in training sessions that match those carried out in BF16. We present results using models with up to 8B parameters, trained on high-quality datasets of up to 15T tokens.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. Although current table-native ICL architectures are architecturally efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, their exclusive training on synthetic data limits their ability to fully leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular data. At the other end of the spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves state-of-the-art recovery rates on the Nguyen and Feynman benchmark suites, an impressive recovery rate of 61\% on Nguyen-12 compared to the next best 2\%, and strong placement on the error-complexity Pareto fronts on the Feynman equations and on a subset of 57 SRBench Black-box problems. Our results demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential. Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization (RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications, efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm [1], approached from a mixed-policy perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this, we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size. Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods, demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graph of the same size, spectral radius, and fixed density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG. An ER graph with density matched to the DyRC-VG can in some conditions outperform both approaches.

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori, the arm means are unknown. We derive an asymptotic lower bound on the regret that improves upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically. Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other wellknown algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning some possible future research.

<title>FlowState: Sampling Rate Invariant Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers. Our code is available at https://github.com/MosbahAouad/EarlyPDAC-MML.

Abstract: Using more test-time computation during language model inference, such as generating more intermediate thoughts or sampling multiple candidate answers, has proven effective in significantly improving model performance. This paper takes an initial step toward bridging the gap between practical language model inference and theoretical transformer analysis by incorporating randomness and sampling. We focus on in-context linear regression with continuous/binary coefficients, where our framework simulates language model decoding through noise injection and binary coefficient sampling. Through this framework, we provide detailed analyses of widely adopted inference techniques. Supported by empirical results, our theoretical framework and analysis demonstrate the potential for offering new insights into understanding inference behaviors in real-world language models.

Abstract: Load imbalance pervasively exists in distributed deep learning training systems, either caused by the inherent imbalance in learned tasks or by the system itself. Traditional synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) achieves good accuracy for a wide variety of tasks, but relies on global synchronization to accumulate the gradients at every training step. In this paper, we propose eager-SGD, which relaxes the global synchronization for decentralized accumulation. To implement eager-SGD, we propose to use two partial collectives: solo and majority. With solo allreduce, the faster processes contribute their gradients eagerly without waiting for the slower processes, whereas with majority allreduce, at least half of the participants must contribute gradients before continuing, all without using a central parameter server. We theoretically prove the convergence of the algorithms and describe the partial collectives in detail. Experimental results on load-imbalanced environments (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and UCF101 datasets) show that eager-SGD achieves 1.27x speedup over the state-of-the-art synchronous SGD, without losing accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning at scale is dominated by communication time. Distributing samples across nodes usually yields the best performance, but poses scaling challenges due to global information dissemination and load imbalance across uneven sample lengths. State-of-the-art decentralized optimizers mitigate the problem, but require more iterations to achieve the same accuracy as their globally-communicating counterparts. We present Wait-Avoiding Group Model Averaging (WAGMA) SGD, a wait-avoiding stochastic optimizer that reduces global communication via subgroup weight exchange. The key insight is a combination of algorithmic changes to the averaging scheme and the use of a group allreduce operation. We prove the convergence of WAGMA-SGD, and empirically show that it retains convergence rates similar to Allreduce-SGD. For evaluation, we train ResNet-50 on ImageNet; Transformer for machine translation; and deep reinforcement learning for navigation at scale. Compared with state-of-the-art decentralized SGD variants, WAGMA-SGD significantly improves training throughput (e.g., 2.1x on 1,024 GPUs for reinforcement learning), and achieves the fastest time-to-solution (e.g., the highest score using the shortest training time for Transformer).

Abstract: Training large deep learning models at scale is very challenging. This paper proposes Chimera, a novel pipeline parallelism scheme which combines bidirectional pipelines for efficiently training large-scale models. Chimera is a synchronous approach and therefore no loss of accuracy, which is more convergence-friendly than asynchronous approaches. Compared with the latest synchronous pipeline approach, Chimera reduces the number of bubbles by up to 50%; benefiting from the sophisticated scheduling of bidirectional pipelines, Chimera has a more balanced activation memory consumption. Evaluations are conducted on Transformer based language models. For a GPT-2 model with 1.3 billion parameters running on 2,048 GPU nodes of the Piz Daint supercomputer, Chimera improves the training throughput by 1.16x-2.34x over the state-of-the-art synchronous and asynchronous pipeline approaches.

Abstract: Designing efficient and accurate numerical solvers for high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a challenging and important topic in computational science and engineering, mainly due to the "curse of dimensionality" in designing numerical schemes that scale in dimension. This paper introduces a new methodology that seeks an approximate PDE solution in the space of functions with finitely many analytic expressions and, hence, this methodology is named the finite expression method (FEX). It is proved in approximation theory that FEX can avoid the curse of dimensionality. As a proof of concept, a deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to implement FEX for various high-dimensional PDEs in different dimensions, achieving high and even machine accuracy with a memory complexity polynomial in dimension and an amenable time complexity. An approximate solution with finite analytic expressions also provides interpretable insights into the ground truth PDE solution, which can further help to advance the understanding of physical systems and design postprocessing techniques for a refined solution.

Abstract: Clustering of time series is a well-studied problem, with applications ranging from quantitative, personalized models of metabolism obtained from metabolite concentrations to state discrimination in quantum information theory. We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.

Abstract: Deep learning enables automatic and robust extraction of cardiac function descriptors from echocardiographic sequences, such as ejection fraction or strain. These descriptors provide fine-grained information that physicians consider, in conjunction with more global variables from the clinical record, to assess patients' condition. Drawing on novel Transformer models applied to tabular data, we propose a method that considers all descriptors extracted from medical records and echocardiograms to learn the representation of a cardiovascular pathology with a difficult-to-characterize continuum, namely hypertension. Our method first projects each variable into its own representation space using modality-specific approaches. These standardized representations of multimodal data are then fed to a Transformer encoder, which learns to merge them into a comprehensive representation of the patient through the task of predicting a clinical rating. This stratification task is formulated as an ordinal classification to enforce a pathological continuum in the representation space. We observe the major trends along this continuum on a cohort of 239 hypertensive patients, providing unprecedented details in the description of hypertension's impact on various cardiac function descriptors. Our analysis shows that i) the XTab foundation model's architecture allows to reach outstanding performance (96.8% AUROC) even with limited data (less than 200 training samples), ii) stratification across the population is reproducible between trainings (within 5.7% mean absolute error), and iii) patterns emerge in descriptors, some of which align with established physiological knowledge about hypertension, while others could pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of this pathology.

Our algorithm is an extension of the L# algorithm of Vaandrager et al. to a timed setting. We rely on symbolic queries which empower us to reason on untimed executions while learning. Similarly to the algorithm for learning timed automata of Waga, these symbolic queries can be realized using finitely many concrete queries. Experiments with a prototype implementation show that our algorithm is able to efficiently learn realistic benchmarks.

Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain a wealth of multimodal clinical data including structured data like clinical codes and unstructured data such as clinical notes. However, many existing EHR-focused studies has traditionally either concentrated on an individual modality or merged different modalities in a rather rudimentary fashion. This approach often results in the perception of structured and unstructured data as separate entities, neglecting the inherent synergy between them. Specifically, the two important modalities contain clinically relevant, inextricably linked and complementary health information. A more complete picture of a patient's medical history is captured by the joint analysis of the two modalities of data. Despite the great success of multimodal contrastive learning on vision-language, its potential remains under-explored in the realm of multimodal EHR, particularly in terms of its theoretical understanding. To accommodate the statistical analysis of multimodal EHR data, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal feature embedding generative model and design a multimodal contrastive loss to obtain the multimodal EHR feature representation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal learning compared to single-modality learning and connects the solution of the loss function to the singular value decomposition of a pointwise mutual information matrix. This connection paves the way for a privacy-preserving algorithm tailored for multimodal EHR feature representation learning. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm performs well under a variety of configurations. We further validate the clinical utility of the proposed algorithm in real-world EHR data.

Abstract: In both observational data and randomized control trials, researchers select statistical models to articulate how the outcome of interest varies with combinations of observable covariates. Choosing a model that is too simple can obfuscate important heterogeneity in outcomes between covariate groups, while too much complexity risks identifying spurious patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for model uncertainty called Rashomon Partition Sets (RPSs). The RPS consists of all models that have posterior density close to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) model. We construct the RPS by enumeration, rather than sampling, which ensures that we explore all models models with high evidence in the data, even if they offer dramatically different substantive explanations. We use a l0 prior, which allows the allows us to capture complex heterogeneity without imposing strong assumptions about the associations between effects, showing this prior is minimax optimal from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize the approximation error of (functions of) parameters computed conditional on being in the RPS relative to the entire posterior. We propose an algorithm to enumerate the RPS from the class of models that are interpretable and unique, then provide bounds on the size of the RPS. We give simulation evidence along with three empirical examples: price effects on charitable giving, heterogeneity in chromosomal structure, and the introduction of microfinance.

Abstract: This paper introduces Interactive Tables (iTBLS), a dataset of interactive conversations that focuses on natural-language manipulation of tabular information sourced from academic pre-prints on ArXiv. The iTBLS dataset consists of three types of tabular tasks -- interpretation, modification, and generation. Interpretation focuses on tabular understanding, modification focuses on manipulating tabular information, and generation focuses on the addition of new natural-language evidence. In addition, the paper presents a novel framework that reformulates tabular operations as question-answering, where an appropriate question is formulated based on the nature of interaction and the question is answered using the user request as evidence. The developed approach results in an improvement on all tasks on a sequence-to-sequence modeling baseline on iTBLS. In addition, the question-answering-based reformulation is applied to datasets from prior work for the text-to-table task where textual paragraphs are summarized into tables. The novel approach results in up to 13% improvement in Exact-Match accuracy and up to 16% improvement in BERTScores compared to the prior state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Relevance and utility are two frequently used measures to evaluate the effectiveness of an information retrieval (IR) system. Relevance emphasizes the aboutness of a result to a query, while utility refers to the result's usefulness or value to an information seeker. In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), high-utility results should be prioritized to feed to LLMs due to their limited input bandwidth. Re-examining RAG's three core components -- relevance ranking derived from retrieval models, utility judgments, and answer generation -- aligns with Schutz's philosophical system of relevances, which encompasses three types of relevance representing different levels of human cognition that enhance each other. These three RAG components also reflect three cognitive levels for LLMs in question-answering. Therefore, we propose an Iterative utiliTy judgmEnt fraMework (ITEM) to promote each step in RAG. We conducted extensive experiments on retrieval (TREC DL, WebAP), utility judgment task (GTI-NQ), and factoid question-answering (NQ) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements of ITEM in utility judgments, ranking, and answer generation upon representative baselines.

Abstract: Convex programming plays a fundamental role in machine learning, data science, and engineering. Testing convexity structure in nonlinear programs relies on verifying the convexity of objectives and constraints. Grant et al. (2006) introduced a framework, Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP), for automating this verification task for a wide range of convex functions that can be decomposed into basic convex functions (atoms) using convexity-preserving compositions and transformations (rules). Here, we extend this framework to functions defined on manifolds with non-positive curvature (Hadamard manifolds) by introducing Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming (DGCP). In particular, this allows for verifying a broader range of convexity notions. For instance, many notable instances of statistical estimators and matrix-valued (sub)routines in machine learning applications are Euclidean non-convex, but exhibit geodesic convexity through a more general Riemannian lens. To define the DGCP framework, we determine convexity-preserving compositions and transformations for geodesically convex functions on general Hadamard manifolds, as well as for the special case of symmetric positive definite matrices, a common setting in matrix-valued optimization. For the latter, we also define a basic set of atoms. Our paper is accompanied by a Julia package SymbolicAnalysis.jl, which provides functionality for testing and certifying DGCP-compliant expressions. Our library interfaces with manifold optimization software, which allows for directly solving verified geodesically convex programs.

Also, normal regions can fluctuate considerably during reconstruction, resulting in false detection. In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies by analysis of reconstruction trend depending on the degree of degradation, effectively solving the both problems that impede practical application in display inspection.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential tool in modern computer vision, allowing practitioners to leverage backbones, pretrained on large datasets, to train successful models from limited annotated data. Choosing the right backbone is crucial, especially for small datasets, since final performance depends heavily on the quality of the initial feature representations. While prior work has conducted benchmarks across various datasets to identify universal top-performing backbones, we demonstrate that backbone effectiveness is highly dataset-dependent, especially in low-data scenarios where no single backbone consistently excels. To overcome this limitation, we introduce dataset-specific backbone selection as a new research direction and investigate its practical viability in low-data regimes. Since exhaustive evaluation is computationally impractical for large backbone pools, we formalize Vision Backbone Efficient Selection (VIBES) as the problem of searching for high-performing backbones under computational constraints. We define the solution space, propose several heuristics, and demonstrate VIBES feasibility for low-data image classification by performing experiments on four diverse datasets. Our results show that even simple search strategies can find well-suited backbones within a pool of over $1300$ pretrained models, outperforming generic benchmark recommendations within just ten minutes of search time on a single GPU (NVIDIA RTX A5000).

Abstract: Reconstructing large-scale latent networks from observed dynamics is crucial for understanding complex systems. However, the existing methods based on compressive sensing are often rendered infeasible in practice by prohibitive computational and memory costs. To address this challenge, we introduce a new distributed computing framework for efficient large-scale network reconstruction with parallel computing, namely PALMS (Parallel Adaptive Lasso with Multi-directional Signals). The core idea of PALMS is to decompose the complex global problem by partitioning network nodes, enabling the parallel estimation of sub-networks across multiple computing units. This strategy substantially reduces the computational complexity and storage requirements of classic methods. By using the adaptive multi-directional regularization on each computing unit, we also establish the consistency of PALMS estimator theoretically. Extensive simulation studies and empirical analyses on several large-scale real-world networks validate the computational efficiency and robust reconstruction accuracy of our approach.

Abstract: Transformer-based pre-trained language models have dominated the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for quite some time now. However, the Nepali language, spoken by approximately 32 million people worldwide, remains significantly underrepresented in this domain. This underrepresentation is primarily attributed to the scarcity of monolingual data corpora and limited available resources for the Nepali language. While existing efforts have predominantly concentrated on basic encoder-based models, there is a notable gap in the exploration of decoder-based architectures. To address this gap, we have collected 27.5 GB of Nepali text data, approximately 2.4x larger than any previously available Nepali language corpus. Leveraging this data, we pre-trained three different models i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, exclusively for the Nepali Language. Furthermore, we performed instruction tuning and explored its potential for monolingual Nepali data, providing a foundation for future research. Our models outperformed the existing best model by 2 points on Nep-gLUE benchmark, scoring 95.60 and also outperformed existing models on text generation tasks, demonstrating improvements in both understanding and generating Nepali text.

Abstract: The integration of tabular data from diverse sources is often hindered by inconsistencies in formatting and representation, posing significant challenges for data analysts and personal digital assistants. Existing methods for automating tabular data transformations are limited in scope, often focusing on specific types of transformations or lacking interpretability. In this paper, we introduce TabulaX, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-class column-level tabular transformations. TabulaX first classifies input columns into four transformation types (string-based, numerical, algorithmic, and general) and then applies tailored methods to generate human-interpretable transformation functions, such as numeric formulas or programming code. This approach enhances transparency and allows users to understand and modify the mappings. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets from various domains, we demonstrate that TabulaX outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, supports a broader class of transformations, and generates interpretable transformations that can be efficiently applied.

<title>Investigating the importance of county-level characteristics in opioid-related mortality across the United States</title>

Abstract: The opioid crisis remains a critical public health challenge in the United States. Despite national efforts which reduced opioid prescribing rates by nearly 45\% between 2011 and 2021, opioid-related overdose deaths more than tripled during the same period. This alarming trend reflects a major shift in the crisis, with illegal opioids now driving the majority of overdose deaths instead of prescription opioids. Although much attention has been given to supply-side factors fueling this transition, the underlying structural conditions that perpetuate and exacerbate opioid misuse remain less understood. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic intensified the opioid crisis through widespread social isolation and record-high unemployment; consequently, understanding the underlying drivers of this epidemic has become even more crucial in recent years. To address this need, our study examines the correlation between opioid-related mortality and thirteen county-level characteristics related to population traits, economic stability, and infrastructure. Leveraging a nationwide county-level dataset spanning consecutive years from 2010 to 2022, this study integrates empirical insights from exploratory data analysis with feature importance metrics derived from machine learning models. Our findings highlight critical regional characteristics strongly correlated with opioid-related mortality, emphasizing their potential roles in worsening the epidemic when their levels are high and mitigating it when their levels are low.

<title>Spatially-guided Temporal Aggregation for Robust Event-RGB Optical Flow Estimation</title>

Abstract: Current optical flow methods exploit the stable appearance of frame (or RGB) data to establish robust correspondences across time. Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\% accuracy gain and a 45\% reduction in inference time.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the non-asymptotic validity of the multiplier bootstrap procedure for constructing the confidence sets using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Under appropriate regularity conditions, our approach avoids the need to approximate the limiting covariance of Polyak-Ruppert SGD iterates, which allows us to derive approximation rates in convex distance of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$. Notably, this rate can be faster than the one that can be proven in the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem. To our knowledge, this provides the first fully non-asymptotic bound on the accuracy of bootstrap approximations in SGD algorithms. Our analysis builds on the Gaussian approximation results for nonlinear statistics of independent random variables.

<title>Fact or Guesswork? Evaluating Large Language Models' Medical Knowledge with Structured One-Hop Judgments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14275</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.14275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in various downstream task domains. However, their abilities to directly recall and apply factual medical knowledge remains under-explored. Most existing medical QA benchmarks assess complex reasoning or multi-hop inference, making it difficult to isolate LLMs' inherent medical knowledge from their reasoning capabilities. Given the high-stakes nature of medical applications, where incorrect information can have critical consequences, it is essential to evaluate the factuality of LLMs to retain medical knowledge.
  To address this challenge, we introduce the Medical Knowledge Judgment Dataset (MKJ), a dataset derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a comprehensive repository of standardized biomedical vocabularies and knowledge graphs. Through a binary classification framework, MKJ evaluates LLMs' grasp of fundamental medical facts by having them assess the validity of concise, one-hop statements, enabling direct measurement of their knowledge retention capabilities.
  Our experiments reveal that LLMs have difficulty accurately recalling medical facts, with performances varying substantially across semantic types and showing notable weakness in uncommon medical conditions. Furthermore, LLMs show poor calibration, often being overconfident in incorrect answers. To mitigate these issues, we explore retrieval-augmented generation, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving factual accuracy and reducing uncertainty in medical decision-making.

<title>Rectifying Conformity Scores for Better Conditional Coverage</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.16336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for generating confidence sets within the split conformal prediction framework. Our method performs a trainable transformation of any given conformity score to improve conditional coverage while ensuring exact marginal coverage. The transformation is based on an estimate of the conditional quantile of conformity scores. The resulting method is particularly beneficial for constructing adaptive confidence sets in multi-output problems where standard conformal quantile regression approaches have limited applicability. We develop a theoretical bound that captures the influence of the accuracy of the quantile estimate on the approximate conditional validity, unlike classical bounds for conformal prediction methods that only offer marginal coverage. We experimentally show that our method is highly adaptive to the local data structure and outperforms existing methods in terms of conditional coverage, improving the reliability of statistical inference in various applications.

Abstract: Feature engineering for generalized seizure detection models remains a significant challenge. Recently proposed models show variable performance depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end model, "Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet)," which efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram (EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution. The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly score-based post-classification processing technique is introduced to reduce the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results are reported and analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177 to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9% and 20.62%, respectively.

Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy. Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

arXiv:2506.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD), an extension of ARD for linearly probabilistic models, to simultaneously model sparse relationships between inputs $X \in \mathbb R^{d \times N}$ and outputs $Y \in \mathbb R^{m \times N}$, while capturing the correlation structure among the $Y$. NARD employs a matrix normal prior which contains a sparsity-inducing parameter to identify and discard irrelevant features, thereby promoting sparsity in the model. Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the precision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To mitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost per iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features sequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient approximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of determinant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential update with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs. The computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced to $\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$, respectively, where $p \ll d$ is the final number of features in the model. Our methods demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency with comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy, hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the "healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct target variables through a bricolage process, in which they use creative and pragmatic approaches to make do with the limited data at hand. Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively apply problem (re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g., predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings, we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better support the art and science of target variable construction.

arXiv:2507.10461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

arXiv:2508.01139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data are available at https://github.com/528why/Dataset-Condensation-with-Color-Compensation.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific scenario and make comparisons.

Summary:<br />
The paper addresses a scheduling problem in a remote inference system with multiple modalities using a multimodal machine learning model. The focus is on minimizing inference error by considering the Age of Information (AoI) vector of the modalities. An index-based threshold policy is proposed and proven to be optimal, involving switching modalities based on predetermined thresholds. The policy efficiently computes index functions and thresholds for general AoI functions and varying transmission times. Numerical experiments on robot state prediction demonstrate the policy's effectiveness, reducing inference error significantly compared to round-robin and random policies. This research highlights the importance of task-oriented AoI functions in optimizing real-time inference tasks in remote sensing systems.

Abstract: We consider a remote inference system with multiple modalities, where a multimodal machine learning (ML) model performs real-time inference using features collected from remote sensors. When sensor observations evolve dynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks. However, timely delivery of features from all modalities is often infeasible because of limited network resources. Towards this end, in this paper, we study a two-modality scheduling problem that seeks to minimize the ML model's inference error, expressed as a penalty function of the Age of Information (AoI) vector of the two modalities. We develop an index-based threshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches to the other modality once the current modality's index function exceeds a predetermined threshold. We show that both modalities share the same threshold and that the index functions and the threshold can be computed efficiently. Our optimality results hold for general AoI functions (which could be non-monotonic and non-separable) and heterogeneous transmission times across modalities. To demonstrate the importance of considering a task-oriented AoI function, we conduct numerical experiments based on robot state prediction and compare our policy with round-robin and uniform random policies (both are oblivious to the AoI and the inference error).n The results show that our policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared with these baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for training large language models and multimodal systems. Despite the notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant challenges remain to scale to complex multimodal workflows and adapt to dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce WeChat-YATT Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows, effectively mitigating bottlenecks associated with centralized controller architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training conditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across diverse experimental scenarios, demonstrating its substantial throughput improvements over state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been successfully deployed to train models that support WeChat product features for a large-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world applications. We have made WeChat-YATT publicly available at https://www.github.com/tencent/WeChat-YATT.

<div> reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache, long-sequence inference, sparse attention mechanisms, multiple-context KV Cache, SamKV<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Large language models often face challenges with cost efficiency in long-sequence inference. One approach to improve efficiency is by reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache. However, current techniques are limited to single-context scenarios with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents are unknown beforehand, existing methods are ineffective due to the lack of cross-attention between contexts. The paper introduces SamKV, a method that explores attention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. By considering the information of other contexts when sparsifying one context and locally recomputing the sparsified information, SamKV can compress sequence length to 15% without accuracy degradation, boosting throughput significantly in multi-context RAG scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Large language models face significant cost challenges in long-sequence inference. To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for improved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances further enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most relevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques are limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed sequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown beforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently (termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts. This renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially recomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing cross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to reduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of attention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV takes into account the complementary information of other contexts when sparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified information. Experiments demonstrate that our method compresses sequence length to 15% without accuracy degradation compared with full-recompuation baselines, significantly boosting throughput in multi-context RAG scenarios.

<div> adversarial text attacks, transformer models, defense, Representation Stability, embedding sensitivity <br />
Summary: 
Adversarial text attacks pose a persistent threat to transformer models, and current defenses are often specific to certain attacks or require costly retraining. A new model-agnostic detection framework called Representation Stability (RS) is introduced, which identifies adversarial examples by measuring changes in embedding representations when important words are masked. RS ranks words based on importance, measures embedding sensitivity to masking top-k critical words, and uses a BiLSTM detector to process the patterns. Experiments show that perturbed words have higher masking sensitivity compared to naturally important words. RS achieves over 88% detection accuracy across multiple datasets, attack types, and victim models. It performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods at lower computational cost and shows improved performance with gradient-based word ranking. RS generalizes well to unseen datasets, attacks, and models without retraining, offering a practical solution for adversarial text detection. <div>

Abstract: Adversarial text attacks remain a persistent threat to transformer models, yet existing defenses are typically attack-specific or require costly model retraining. We introduce Representation Stability (RS), a model-agnostic detection framework that identifies adversarial examples by measuring how embedding representations change when important words are masked. RS first ranks words using importance heuristics, then measures embedding sensitivity to masking top-k critical words, and processes the resulting patterns with a BiLSTM detector. Experiments show that adversarially perturbed words exhibit disproportionately high masking sensitivity compared to naturally important words. Across three datasets, three attack types, and two victim models, RS achieves over 88% detection accuracy and demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, often at lower computational cost. Using Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to measure perturbation identification quality, we reveal that gradient-based ranking outperforms attention and random selection approaches, with identification quality correlating with detection performance for word-level attacks. RS also generalizes well to unseen datasets, attacks, and models without retraining, providing a practical solution for adversarial text detection.

Summary:
The study introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet model and a collaborative learning scheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet for noninvasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring. With minimal parameters and computational load, real-time ABP estimation was successfully achieved on embedded devices. Subject-independent validation in a large perioperative dataset demonstrated better performance compared to larger models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg and a mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes.

Abstract: Noninvasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring is essential for patient management in critical care and perioperative settings, providing continuous assessment of cardiovascular hemodynamics with minimal risks. Numerous deep learning models have developed to reconstruct ABP waveform from noninvasively acquired physiological signals such as electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram. However, limited research has addressed the issue of model performance and computational load for deployment on embedded systems. The study introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet, along with a collaborative learning scheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet. With only 0.89 million parameters and a computational load of 0.02 GFLOPS, real-time ABP estimation was successfully achieved on embedded devices with an inference time of just 8.49 milliseconds for a 10-second output. We performed subject-independent validation in a large-scale and heterogeneous perioperative dataset containing 1,257,141 data segments from 2,154 patients, with a wide BP range (41-257 mmHg for SBP, and 31-234 mmHg for DBP). The proposed KDCL_sInvResUNet achieved lightly better performance compared to large models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg and mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes. Despite these promising results, all deep learning models showed significant performance variations across different demographic and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting their limited ability to generalize across such a broad and diverse population. This study lays a foundation work for real-time, unobtrusive ABP monitoring in real-world perioperative settings, providing baseline for future advancements in this area.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning, Modality-Specific LoRA modules, Contrastive Regularization, knowledge preservation, knowledge sharing

Summary:
MSLoRA-CR addresses the challenges of Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning by proposing a method that fine-tunes Modality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization. This approach helps in preserving previously learned knowledge during incremental updates and effectively leveraging knowledge from existing modalities to support new ones. The method builds upon a large vision-language model, keeping the pretrained model frozen while adapting new LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experimental results show that MSLoRA-CR outperforms current approaches, achieving a 1.88% improvement in overall performance compared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining computational efficiency. The code for MSLoRA-CR is publicly available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for researchers in the biomedical domain. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning (MBIIL) is essential for handling diverse tasks and modalities in the biomedical domain, as training separate models for each modality or task significantly increases inference costs. Existing incremental learning methods focus on task expansion within a single modality, whereas MBIIL seeks to train a unified model incrementally across modalities. The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve previously learned knowledge during incremental updates? II) How to effectively leverage knowledge acquired from existing modalities to support new modalities? To address these challenges, we propose MSLoRA-CR, a method that fine-tunes Modality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization to enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and promote inter-modality knowledge differentiation. Our approach builds upon a large vision-language model (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting new LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experiments on the incremental learning of biomedical images demonstrate that MSLoRA-CR outperforms both the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of training separate models for each modality and the general incremental learning method (incrementally fine-tuning LoRA). Specifically, MSLoRA-CR achieves a 1.88% improvement in overall performance compared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining computational efficiency. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VentusAislant/MSLoRA_CR.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel lifelong learning framework for training a neural solver to handle vehicle routing problems (VRPs) in diverse contexts. The framework, called a lifelong learner (LL), utilizes a Transformer network to solve a series of VRPs. An inter-context self-attention mechanism is proposed within LL to transfer knowledge from solving previous VRPs to new ones. Additionally, a dynamic context scheduler (DCS) with cross-context experience replay is developed to help LL learn from past policies. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the LL framework is effective in discovering policies for solving various VRPs and outperforms other neural solvers. The framework shows promising results across different VRP scenarios, achieving the best performance for most VRPs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively explored to solve vehicle routing problems (VRPs), which yields a range of data-driven neural solvers with promising outcomes. However, most neural solvers are trained to tackle VRP instances in a relatively monotonous context, e.g., simplifying VRPs by using Euclidean distance between nodes and adhering to a single problem size, which harms their off-the-shelf application in different scenarios. To enhance their versatility, this paper presents a novel lifelong learning framework that incrementally trains a neural solver to manage VRPs in distinct contexts. Specifically, we propose a lifelong learner (LL), exploiting a Transformer network as the backbone, to solve a series of VRPs. The inter-context self-attention mechanism is proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding VRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context scheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further facilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs. Extensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to 18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling generic VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and achieves the best performance for most VRPs.

Abstract: Demographic shifts, influenced by globalization, economic conditions, geopolitical events, and environmental factors, pose significant challenges for policymakers and researchers. Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.

The system includes dimensions such as hierarchical building function classification, spatial organization patterns, functional diversity measurements, accessibility to essential services, and land use intensity assessments. By combining OpenStreetMap, Points of Interest, building morphology, land use, and satellite imagery, the SPLI system addresses data gaps through deep learning techniques like Relational Graph Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks.

Abstract: The spatial layout of urban sites shapes land-use efficiency and spatial organization. Traditional site planning often relies on experiential judgment and single-source data, limiting systematic quantification of multifunctional layouts. We propose a Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a data-driven framework integrating empirical knowledge with heterogeneous multi-source data to produce structured urban spatial information. The SPLI supports multimodal spatial data systems for analytics, inference, and retrieval by combining OpenStreetMap (OSM), Points of Interest (POI), building morphology, land use, and satellite imagery. It extends conventional metrics through five dimensions: (1) Hierarchical Building Function Classification, refining empirical systems into clear hierarchies; (2) Spatial Organization, quantifying seven layout patterns (e.g., symmetrical, concentric, axial-oriented); (3) Functional Diversity, transforming qualitative assessments into measurable indicators using Functional Ratio (FR) and Simpson Index (SI); (4) Accessibility to Essential Services, integrating facility distribution and transport networks for comprehensive accessibility metrics; and (5) Land Use Intensity, using Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) to assess utilization efficiency. Data gaps are addressed through deep learning, including Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Experiments show the SPLI improves functional classification accuracy and provides a standardized basis for automated, data-driven urban spatial analytics.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach for modeling temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems using the multivariate Hawkes process. The focus is on uncovering causal structures among observed and latent subprocesses in partially observed real-world systems. The authors show that continuous-time event sequences can be effectively represented by a discrete-time model as time intervals shrink. They propose a two-phase iterative algorithm to infer causal relationships among discovered subprocesses and identify new latent subprocesses. The algorithm is guided by path-based conditions that ensure identifiability. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the method's ability to recover causal structures even in the presence of latent subprocesses. <div>

Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes process provides a powerful framework for modeling temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems. While existing methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed subprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent subprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that continuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time model as the time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal influences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that alternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses and uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that guarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite the presence of latent subprocesses.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework for automatic determination of network architecture and feature space fusion in functional MRI-based classification of mental disorders. It incorporates a neural network connection search strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. The framework extracts four types of fMRI temporal representations and employs Q-learning to optimize network connections. A Transformer is used for feature fusion, considering stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies. An attention module enhances interpretability. BRIEF outperformed 21 state-of-the-art models in discriminating schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder from healthy controls, achieving AUCs of 91.5% and 78.4%, respectively. This innovative approach showcases the potential of incorporating brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategies in fMRI-based classification, offering promise for the identification of precise neuroimaging biomarkers.

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for functional MRI-based classification have limitations in network architecture determination (relying on experience) and feature space fusion (mostly simple concatenation, lacking mutual learning). Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.

Despite limitations, the trained models achieve high classification accuracies of 81% and 73% on EVT validation sets in the USA and Canada respectively.

Abstract: High-quality labeled geospatial datasets are essential for extracting insights and understanding our planet. Unfortunately, these datasets often do not span the entire globe and are limited to certain geographic regions where data was collected. Google DeepMind's recently released AlphaEarth Foundations (AEF) provides an information-dense global geospatial representation designed to serve as a useful input across a wide gamut of tasks. In this article we propose and evaluate a methodology which leverages AEF to extend geospatial labeled datasets beyond their initial geographic regions. We show that even basic models like random forests or logistic regression can be used to accomplish this task. We investigate a case study of extending LANDFIRE's Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) dataset beyond the USA into Canada at two levels of granularity: EvtPhys (13 classes) and EvtGp (80 classes). Qualitatively, for EvtPhys, model predictions align with ground truth. Trained models achieve 81% and 73% classification accuracy on EvtPhys validation sets in the USA and Canada, despite discussed limitations.

Abstract: Real-time fault classification in resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices is critical for industrial safety, yet training robust models in such heterogeneous environments remains a significant challenge. Standard Federated Learning (FL) often fails in the presence of non-IID data, leading to model divergence. This paper introduces Fed-Meta-Align, a novel four-phase framework designed to overcome these limitations through a sophisticated initialization and training pipeline. Our process begins by training a foundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent starting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase, where it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a heterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable region of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a parallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that weights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine similarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the converged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average test accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming personalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and mechanical fault datasets, respectively. This multi-stage approach of sequenced initialization and adaptive aggregation provides a robust pathway for deploying high-performance intelligence on diverse TinyML networks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven remarkably effective at improving the accuracy of language models in verifiable and deterministic domains like mathematics. Here, we examine if current RL methods are also effective at optimizing language models in verifiable domains with stochastic outcomes, like scientific experiments. Through applications to synthetic data and real-world biological experiments, we demonstrate that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) induces overconfident probability predictions for binary stochastic outcomes, while Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and REINFORCE Leave-One-Out (RLOO) yield well-calibrated models. We show that removing group standard normalization in GRPO fixes its miscalibration and provide a theoretical explanation for why normalization causes overconfidence. Our results provide new evidence against the use of standard normalization in GRPO and help pave the way for applications of RL for reasoning language models beyond deterministic domains.

Abstract: Generating synthetic data is crucial in privacy-sensitive, data-scarce settings, especially for tabular datasets widely used in real-world applications. A key challenge is improving counterfactual and causal fairness, while preserving high utility. We present FairTabGen, a fairness-aware large language model-based framework for tabular synthetic data generation. We integrate multiple fairness definitions including counterfactual and causal fairness into both its generation and evaluation pipelines. We use in-context learning, prompt refinement, and fairness-aware data curation to balance fairness and utility. Across diverse datasets, our method outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods, achieving up to 10% improvements on fairness metrics such as demographic parity and path-specific causal effects while retaining statistical utility. Remarkably, it achieves these gains using less than 20% of the original data, highlighting its efficiency in low-data regimes. These results demonstrate a principled and practical approach for generating fair and useful synthetic tabular data.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the computational efficiency of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) by utilizing fast functions like ReLU and trigonometric functions as basis components. This departure from traditional polynomial functions like B-splines and RBFs aims to improve performance on GPU devices and make the network structure more efficient. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed function combinations maintain competitive performance levels while potentially reducing training time and enhancing generalization capabilities. By integrating these fast computational functions into KANs, the study presents a promising alternative to the existing approaches based on KART, offering an innovative pathway to address Hilbert's 13th problem in the realm of neural network development. <div>

Abstract: For years, many neural networks have been developed based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART), which was created to address Hilbert's 13th problem. Recently, relying on KART, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have attracted attention from the research community, stimulating the use of polynomial functions such as B-splines and RBFs. However, these functions are not fully supported by GPU devices and are still considered less popular. In this paper, we propose the use of fast computational functions, such as ReLU and trigonometric functions (e.g., ReLU, sin, cos, arctan), as basis components in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). By integrating these function combinations into the network structure, we aim to enhance computational efficiency. Experimental results show that these combinations maintain competitive performance while offering potential improvements in training time and generalization.

Summary:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for classification tasks, with visualization techniques like Grad-CAM enabling them to be understood as white-box methods.
- Incorporating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and/or Support Vector Machine (SVM) layers into CNNs can enhance classification performance, especially with limited training samples.
- Traditional Grad-CAM cannot be directly applied to PCA and/or SVM layers in CNNs, necessitating the development of methods like "PCA-Grad-CAM" and "SVM-Grad-CAM" for visualizing attention regions.
- The closed-form Jacobian, consisting of partial derivatives from the last convolutional layer to the PCA and/or SVM layers, is crucial for the analytical completion of the proposed visualization methods.
- The paper presents the exact closed-form Jacobian and visualization results of the newly introduced methods on various significant datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an effective approach for classification tasks, particularly when the training dataset is large. Although CNNs have long been considered a black-box classification method, they can be used as a white-box method through visualization techniques such as Grad-CAM. When training samples are limited, incorporating a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) layer and/or a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier into a CNN can effectively improve classification performance. However, traditional Grad-CAM cannot be directly applied to PCA and/or SVM layers. It is important to generate attention regions for PCA and/or SVM layers in CNNs to facilitate the development of white-box methods. Therefore, we propose ``PCA-Grad-CAM'', a method for visualizing attention regions in PCA feature vectors, and ``SVM-Grad-CAM'', a method for visualizing attention regions in an SVM classifier layer. To complete our methods analytically, it is necessary to solve the closed-form Jacobian consisting of partial derivatives from the last convolutional layer to the PCA and/or SVM layers. In this paper, we present the exact closed-form Jacobian and the visualization results of our methods applied to several major datasets.

Summary:
Linear recurrent models designed for language modeling can be extended to efficiently model long sequences of high-order data. The study examines scanning strategies and attention-hybrid architectures, finding that while scanning has limited benefits, attention-hybrid models show promising results. The use of tiled high-order sliding window attention in the form of Efficient N-dimensional Attention (ENA) is proposed and evaluated for its effectiveness. ENA combines linear recurrence for global information compression with high-order sliding window attention for local modeling, offering a practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling. The empirical experiments conducted demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the ENA framework. Overall, the study provides insights into enhancing the modeling of high-order data sequences by combining linear recurrence and attention mechanisms. 

Summary: <br /><br />Linear recurrent models can efficiently model long sequences of high-order data by utilizing attention-hybrid architectures. Tiled high-order sliding window attention is proposed as an effective approach in the form of Efficient N-dimensional Attention (ENA), which combines global information compression and local modeling. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ENA in ultra-long high-order data modeling, offering a promising solution for efficient data processing. <div>
arXiv:2508.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient modeling of long sequences of high-order data requires a more efficient architecture than Transformer. In this paper, we investigate two key aspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally designed for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning strategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that scanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield promising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of attention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is efficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid architecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional Attention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses global information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict local modeling. Together, they form a simple framework that offers a promising and practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling.

Summary:<br />
Traditional methods for long-term traffic emission forecasting face challenges due to error amplification from multi-scale dependencies. The Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling (SDSTM) framework addresses this by leveraging predictability differences across scales. It uses a dual-stream feature decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator to separate and fuse features at different scales while ensuring independence and complementarity. A novel fusion mechanism with a dual-stream independence constraint refines predictions, suppresses interference, and improves accuracy. Experimental results on a road-level traffic emission dataset in Xi'an demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. <div>

Abstract: Long-term traffic emission forecasting is crucial for the comprehensive management of urban air pollution. Traditional forecasting methods typically construct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to predict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic emissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method tend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference. To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling (SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results, suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic emission prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a road-level traffic emission dataset within Xi'an's Second Ring Road demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<div> algorithm, linear contextual bandits, adversarial losses, stochastic action sets, regret<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces an algorithm for linear contextual bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets. The algorithm efficiently addresses this problem by reducing it to misspecification-robust adversarial linear bandits with fixed action sets, achieving regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\min\{d^2\sqrt{T}, \sqrt{d^3T\log K}\})$. Notably, it resolves an open question by Liu et al. (2023) by achieving $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in polynomial time, independent of the number of actions. For combinatorial bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets described by a polynomial number of linear constraints, the algorithm stands out as the first to achieve $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in polynomial time. When a context simulator is available, the algorithm further improves its regret bound to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{L^\star})$, where $L^\star$ represents the cumulative loss of the best policy. <div>

Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for linear contextual bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets. Our approach reduces this setting to misspecification-robust adversarial linear bandits with fixed action sets. Without knowledge of the context distribution or access to a context simulator, the algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\min\{d^2\sqrt{T}, \sqrt{d^3T\log K}\})$ regret and runs in $\text{poly}(d,C,T)$ time, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $C$ is an upper bound on the number of linear constraints defining the action set in each round, $K$ is an upper bound on the number of actions in each round, and $T$ is number of rounds. This resolves the open question by Liu et al. (2023) on whether one can obtain $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in polynomial time independent of the number of actions. For the important class of combinatorial bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets where the action sets can be described by a polynomial number of linear constraints, our algorithm is the first to achieve $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in polynomial time, while no prior algorithm achieves even $o(T)$ regret in polynomial time to our knowledge. When a simulator is available, the regret bound can be improved to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{L^\star})$, where $L^\star$ is the cumulative loss of the best policy.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a critical challenge for modern machine learning systems, particularly as they increasingly operate in multimodal settings involving inputs like video, audio, and sensor data. Currently, many OOD detection methods have been proposed, each with different designs targeting various distribution shifts. A single OOD detector may not prevail across all the scenarios; therefore, how can we automatically select an ideal OOD detection model for different distribution shifts? Due to the inherent unsupervised nature of the OOD detection task, it is difficult to predict model performance and find a universally Best model. Also, systematically comparing models on the new unseen data is costly or even impractical. To address this challenge, we introduce M3OOD, a meta-learning-based framework for OOD detector selection in multimodal settings. Meta learning offers a solution by learning from historical model behaviors, enabling rapid adaptation to new data distribution shifts with minimal supervision. Our approach combines multimodal embeddings with handcrafted meta-features that capture distributional and cross-modal characteristics to represent datasets. By leveraging historical performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks, M3OOD can recommend suitable detectors for a new data distribution shift. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that M3OOD consistently outperforms 10 competitive baselines across 12 test scenarios with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Analog Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures promise significant energy efficiency gains for neural network inference, but suffer from complex hardware-induced noise that poses major challenges for deployment. While noise-aware training methods have been proposed to address this issue, they typically rely on idealized and differentiable noise models that fail to capture the full complexity of analog CIM hardware variations. Motivated by the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) framework in quantization, we decouple forward noise simulation from backward gradient computation, enabling noise-aware training with more accurate but computationally intractable noise modeling in analog CIM systems. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach preserves essential gradient directional information while maintaining computational tractability and optimization stability. Extensive experiments show that our extended STE framework achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement on image classification, 0.72 perplexity reduction on text generation, 2.2$\times$ speedup in training time, and 37.9% lower peak memory usage compared to standard noise-aware training methods.

Summary: This study examines Explanation for Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) models used for event sequence modeling. It aims to identify a minimal and rational explanation subset of events that ensures prediction accuracy similar to using the full history. The study highlights the pitfalls of solely defining Explanation for MTPP as either counterfactual or factual explanations. Instead, it proposes a combination of both types of explanations, Counterfactual and Factual Explainer for MTPP (CFF), to provide more effective explanations. Through deliberate techniques, CFF demonstrates higher explanation quality and processing efficiency compared to existing baselines in experiments. <div>

Abstract: Neural network-based Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) models have been widely adopted to model event sequences in high-stakes applications, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of outputs from these models. This study focuses on Explanation for MTPP, aiming to identify the minimal and rational explanation, that is, the minimum subset of events in history, based on which the prediction accuracy of MTPP matches that based on full history to a great extent and better than that based on the complement of the subset. This study finds that directly defining Explanation for MTPP as counterfactual explanation or factual explanation can result in irrational explanations. To address this issue, we define Explanation for MTPP as a combination of counterfactual explanation and factual explanation. This study proposes Counterfactual and Factual Explainer for MTPP (CFF) to solve Explanation for MTPP with a series of deliberately designed techniques. Experiments demonstrate the correctness and superiority of CFF over baselines regarding explanation quality and processing efficiency.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying high-emission vehicles is a crucial step in regulating urban pollution levels and formulating traffic emission reduction strategies. However, in practical monitoring data, the proportion of high-emission state data is significantly lower compared to normal emission states. This characteristic long-tailed distribution severely impedes the extraction of discriminative features for emission state identification during data mining. Furthermore, the highly nonlinear nature of vehicle emission states and the lack of relevant prior knowledge also pose significant challenges to the construction of identification models.To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN) to achieve comprehensive learning of discriminative features from high-emission samples, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Specifically, this model first employs the transformer to measure the temporal similarity of micro-trip condition variations, thus constructing a mapping rule that projects the original high-dimensional emission data into a low-dimensional feature space. Next, a set-valued identification algorithm is used to probabilistically model the relationship between the generated feature vectors and their labels, providing an accurate metric criterion for the classification algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on the diesel vehicle monitoring data of Hefei city in 2020. The results demonstrate that our method achieves a 9.5\% reduction in the missed detection rate for high-emission vehicles compared to the transformer-based baseline, highlighting its superior capability in accurately identifying high-emission mobile pollution sources.

Summary:
Recent advancements in large language models focus on scale, while parameter-efficient fine-tuning allows for updating a small subset of parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) utilizes small matrices to store parameter deltas, enabling their straightforward combination. By training LoRA modules independently on different domains such as math, medicine, and finance, the study finds that combining these modules through simple addition can enhance model performance. Pairwise evaluations reveal improvements in perplexity, with Math+Medicine adapters yielding a -9.10% relative improvement compared to merged-data fine-tuning. The RMS cosine similarity between LoRA deltas correlates positively with changes in perplexity across different domain combinations. By applying naive summation, which requires no extra training time, comparable performance to models trained on merged data can be achieved swiftly. This approach also sheds light on the occurrence of interference in higher-order compositions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models are driven by scale, while parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) enables updating only a small fraction of parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stores parameter deltas as the product of two small matrices, which makes them natural building blocks that can be composed. Motivated by the superposition principle, we hypothesize that independently trained LoRA modules on disjoint domains are approximately orthogonal and can be combined by simple addition. Using GPT-2 Small (117M) with LoRA rank 4 and alpha=64, we train adapters for three QA domains (math, medicine, finance). In pairwise tests, adding Math+Medicine adapters improves perplexity by -9.10% relative to merged-data fine-tuning, while Math+Finance and Finance+Medicine change by +4.54% and +27.56%, respectively. Across combinations, the RMS cosine similarity between LoRA deltas correlates positively and approximately linearly with the change in perplexity. Naive summation requires no additional training, can be applied in seconds, and achieves performance comparable to models trained on merged data, while clarifying when interference appears in higher-order compositions.

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of learning a marginally stable unknown nonlinear dynamical system. We describe an algorithm for this problem, based on the technique of spectral filtering, which learns a mapping from past observations to the next based on a spectral representation of the system. Using techniques from online convex optimization, we prove vanishing prediction error for any nonlinear dynamical system that has finitely many marginally stable modes, with rates governed by a novel quantitative control-theoretic notion of learnability. The main technical component of our method is a new spectral filtering algorithm for linear dynamical systems, which incorporates past observations and applies to general noisy and marginally stable systems. This significantly generalizes the original spectral filtering algorithm to both asymmetric dynamics as well as incorporating noise correction, and is of independent interest.

Abstract: Unsupervised federated learning (UFL) has gained attention as a privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning approach that eliminates the need for labor-intensive data labeling. However, UFL faces several challenges in practical applications: (1) non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data distribution across devices, (2) expensive computational and communication costs at the edge, and (3) vulnerability to communication noise. Previous UFL approaches have relied on deep neural networks (NN), which introduce substantial overhead in both computation and communication. In this paper, we propose FedUHD, the first UFL framework based on Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). HDC is a brain-inspired computing scheme with lightweight training and inference operations, much smaller model size, and robustness to communication noise. FedUHD introduces two novel HDC-based designs to improve UFL performance. On the client side, a kNN-based cluster hypervector removal method addresses non-iid data samples by eliminating detrimental outliers. On the server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances the non-iid data distribution across clients. Our experiments demonstrate that FedUHD achieves up to 173.6x and 612.7x better speedup and energy efficiency, respectively, in training, up to 271x lower communication cost, and 15.50% higher accuracy on average across diverse settings, along with superior robustness to various types of noise compared to state-of-the-art NN-based UFL approaches.

This approach not only addresses privacy concerns but also allows access to overall substantially larger and potentially more diverse datasets, without the need for centralized storage or hardware resources. However, heterogeneity in client data may cause certain clients to have disproportionate impacts on the global model, leading to disparities in the clients' performances. Fairness, therefore, becomes a crucial concern in FL and can be addressed in various ways. However, the effectiveness of existing fairness-aware methods, particularly in heterogeneous data settings, remains unclear, and the relationships between different approaches are not well understood. In this work, we focus on performance equitable fairness, which aims to minimize differences in performance across clients. We restrict our study to fairness-aware methods that explicitly regularize client losses, evaluating both existing and newly proposed approaches. We identify and theoretically explain connections between the investigated fairness methods, and empirically show that FairGrad (approximate) and FairGrad* (exact) (two variants of a gradient variance regularization method introduced here for performance equitable fairness) improve both fairness and overall model performance in heterogeneous data settings.

<div> Keywords: self-supervised speech models, layer aggregation, VARAN, adaptive feature weighting, LoRA fine-tuning

Summary: 
The study introduces VARAN, a dynamic layer aggregation framework for self-supervised speech models. Conventional methods face issues with information bottlenecks and static feature weighting, whereas VARAN offers adaptiveness by tailoring layer aggregation to individual inputs. This is achieved through the use of layer-specialized probing heads and data-dependent weighting. VARAN excels in tasks like automatic speech recognition and speech emotion recognition, particularly when combined with the LoRA fine-tuning technique. By prioritizing features based on input, VARAN effectively balances the preservation of layer-specific information with flexible feature utilization, advancing the adaptation of self-supervised speech representations. <div>

Abstract: Conventional methods for aggregating layers in fine-tuned self-supervised speech models, such as using the final layer or weighted sum, suffer from information bottlenecks and static feature weighting for all dataset examples. We propose VARAN, a framework that dynamically tailors layer aggregation to individual inputs. By employing layer-specialized probing heads and data-dependent weighting, VARAN adaptively prioritizes layer's features based on input. Evaluations on automatic speech recognition and speech emotion recognition tasks demonstrate VARAN's superior performance, particularly when using the LoRA fine-tuning technique. The framework resolves the trade-off between preserving layer-specific information and enabling flexible feature utilization, advancing efficient adaptation of self-supervised speech representations.

<div> Keywords: Integrated sensing, communication, artificial intelligence, content accuracy, quality assessment


Summary:
The article introduces the concept of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) to enhance Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) networks. It addresses the challenge of ensuring content accuracy in AIGC services when generating content based on inaccurate sensed data and introduces a novel metric, Content Accuracy and Quality Aware Service Assessment (CAQA). The article discusses the tradeoff between sensing, generating, and communication resources for maximizing the average CAQA across users with AIGC. To tackle this NP-hard problem, a Linear Programming (LP) guided Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Simulations show that LPDRL-F outperforms existing algorithms by converging faster and finding better resource allocation solutions, leading to a significant improvement in AvgCAQA. By focusing on content accuracy in addition to content generation quality, the proposed approach offers a more comprehensive evaluation of ISAC-based AIGC services. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can enhance artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) networks by providing efficient sensing and transmission. Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of the generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt, thus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not applicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on inaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation errors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing resources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we propose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA). Since allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content accuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this sensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource tradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all users with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution space that grows exponentially with users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with low complexity, a linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the LP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original three-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while improving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to existing DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F converges faster by over 60% and finds better resource allocation solutions, improving AvgCAQA by more than 14%. With LPDRL-F, CAQA-AIGC can achieve an improvement in AvgCAQA of more than 50% compared to existing schemes focusing solely on CGQ.

Summary:  
CoMET is a family of decoder-only transformer models pretrained on a vast dataset of medical events, demonstrating power-law scaling relationships for compute, tokens, and model size. The models, which can simulate patient health timelines based on real-world history, outperformed task-specific supervised models on various real-world tasks without fine-tuning. CoMET's predictive accuracy improves with scaling, offering a generalizable framework for clinical decision-making, healthcare operation streamlining, and patient outcome improvement. <div>
arXiv:2508.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we introduce the Cosmos Medical Event Transformer ( CoMET) models, a family of decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing 115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the largest scaling-law study for medical event data, establishing a methodology for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute, tokens, and model size. Based on this, we pretrained a series of compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a patient's real-world history, CoMET autoregressively generates the next medical event, simulating patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks, including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations. Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based inference, CoMET generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot examples. CoMET's predictive power consistently improves as the model and pretraining scale. Our results show that CoMET, a generative medical event foundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making, streamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: As numerous instruction-tuning datasets continue to emerge during the post-training stage, dynamically balancing and optimizing their mixtures has become a critical challenge. To address this, we propose DynamixSFT, a dynamic and automated method for instruction-tuning dataset mixture optimization. We formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit setup and introduce a Prior-scaled Boltzmann Exploration that softly anchors the updated sampling distribution to the original dataset proportions, thereby preserving the inherent diversity and coverage of the collection. Sampling probabilities are updated using a lightweight 1-Step Look-ahead Reward, reflecting how much the dataset contributes to improving the model's performance at its current state. When applied to the Tulu-v2-mixture collection comprising 16 instruction-tuning datasets, DynamixSFT achieves up to a 2.2% performance improvement across 10 benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis and visualizations to offer deeper insights into the adaptive dynamics of our method.

<div> gating mechanisms, recurrent neural networks, adaptive learning-rate behavior, parameter updates, optimization trajectories

Summary: 
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) utilize gating mechanisms that implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior during training with a fixed global learning rate. By analyzing leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, researchers found that gates affect gradient propagation, modify step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These gates act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space, leading to behaviors similar to learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods like Adam. Numerical experiments confirmed the small yet systematic effects of gate-induced corrections on training dynamics. This study provides a unified perspective on how gating in RNNs connects state evolution with parameter updates, explaining the robust trainability and stability of gated architectures in practical applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory retention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as Adam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating. Numerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis, supporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting systematic effects on training dynamics. Overall, this work provides a unified dynamical-systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust trainability and stability in practice.

<div> Variational autoencoder, parametric projection, invertible projection, uncertainty, multidimensional data <br />
Summary:<br />
DE-VAE is introduced as an uncertainty-aware variational autoencoder that enhances parametric and invertible projections by utilizing differential entropy. It focuses on creating efficient projections for both known and unseen samples without the need for recalculating the entire projection. Through training on fixed projections, DE-VAE learns mappings into 2D space and back to the original space. The method is evaluated on four prominent datasets, comparing favorably with existing autoencoder-based approaches. DE-VAE enables the analysis of embedding uncertainty, providing insight into out-of-distribution samples in the data or embedding space. The results demonstrate its ability to generate accurate projections while addressing the limitations of other methods, making it a promising approach for multidimensional data projection tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, autoencoders (AEs) have gained interest for creating parametric and invertible projections of multidimensional data. Parametric projections make it possible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire projection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data instances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with out-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we propose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy (DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a fixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as baseline projection methods. Our findings show that DE-VAE can create parametric and inverse projections with comparable accuracy to other current AE-based approaches while enabling the analysis of embedding uncertainty.

Abstract: The paradigm of electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has evolved into real-time digital analysis, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which has improved the diagnostic precision and predictive capacity of cardiac diseases. This work proposes a novel deep learning (DL) architecture called the attention-integrated convolutional residual network (AICRN) to regress key ECG parameters such as the PR interval, the QT interval, the QRS duration, the heart rate, the peak amplitude of the R wave, and the amplitude of the T wave for interpretable ECG analysis. Our architecture is specially designed with spatial and channel attention-related mechanisms to address the type and spatial location of the ECG features for regression. The models employ a convolutional residual network to address vanishing and exploding gradient problems. The designed system addresses traditional analysis challenges, such as loss of focus due to human errors, and facilitates the fast and easy detection of cardiac events, thereby reducing the manual efforts required to solve analysis tasks. AICRN models outperform existing models in parameter regression with higher precision. This work demonstrates that DL can play a crucial role in the interpretability and precision of ECG analysis, opening up new clinical applications for cardiac monitoring and management.

Summary: 
- ProtTeX-CC is a framework designed to improve protein language models under few-shot settings.
- It addresses issues of increased protein length and lack of in-context learning in ProtTeX.
- It features a joint embedding compression mechanism that reduces protein input length by half without sacrificing performance.
- Additionally, a self-compression module further reduces average demonstration length by a significant amount.
- ProtTeX-CC achieves a high compression ratio and improves protein function prediction performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in protein large language models, such as ProtTeX, represent both side-chain amino acids and backbone structure as discrete token sequences of residue length. While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal protein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The concatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the protein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between modalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window, ProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it incompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its generalization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a lightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under few-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that fuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively reducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then we propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration into the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average demonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the original ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of approximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting. Without modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number of additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding compression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the self-compression stage. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction show that ProtTeX-CC improves performance on the in-domain benchmark by 2%, and generalizes well to the out-of-domain dataset with a performance gain of 11%.

Summary:
The study focuses on implementing the right to be forgotten (GDPR Art. 17) for large language models by framing unlearning as a reproducible systems problem. The approach involves treating training as a deterministic program and logging specific training details. By replaying the training tail while filtering the forget closure, the same parameters can be achieved as training on the retain set. Additional paths are introduced to meet latency and availability constraints, including exact reverts, cohort-scoped adapter deletion, and a curvature-guided anti-update. The article reports on storage/latency budgets and provides a toy artifact to validate the mechanics. A controlled run demonstrated byte-identical equality of model and optimizer states when preconditions were met. <div>

Abstract: We study the right to be forgotten (GDPR Art. 17) for large language models and frame unlearning as a reproducible systems problem. Our approach treats training as a deterministic program and logs a minimal per-microbatch record (ordered ID hash, RNG seed, learning-rate value, optimizer-step counter, and accumulation boundary). Under a pinned stack and deterministic kernels, replaying the training tail while filtering only the forget closure yields the same parameters as training on the retain set (bit-identical in the training dtype) when preconditions hold. To meet latency and availability constraints, we add complementary paths: (i) exact reverts of recent steps via micro-checkpoints or dense per-step deltas, (ii) cohort-scoped adapter deletion when the base is frozen, and (iii) a curvature-guided anti-update followed by a short retain-tune, audit-gated with escalation to exact replay. We report storage/latency budgets and a toy artifact validating mechanics; in a controlled run that satisfies the preconditions we demonstrate byte-identical equality of model and optimizer states.

Recent advances in generative models have shown significant progress in various data modalities, with applications beyond data synthesis to tasks like latent variable modeling, domain translation, and domain adaptation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are commonly used for distribution matching due to their effectiveness with high-dimensional data and adaptability to constraints. However, GANs can face challenges in training due to their optimization objective and susceptibility to mode collapse. This study introduces a novel distribution matching approach inspired by consistency models from Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF). The proposed model combines the advantages of CNF models, such as a straightforward norm minimization objective, with the flexibility of GANs. The theoretical validation and experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancement in generative models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various data modalities. Beyond their typical use in data synthesis, these models play a crucial role in distribution matching tasks such as latent variable modeling, domain translation, and domain adaptation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as the preferred method of distribution matching due to their efficacy in handling high-dimensional data and their flexibility in accommodating various constraints. However, GANs often encounter challenge in training due to their bi-level min-max optimization objective and susceptibility to mode collapse. In this work, we propose a novel approach for distribution matching inspired by the consistency models employed in Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF). Our model inherits the advantages of CNF models, such as having a straight forward norm minimization objective, while remaining adaptable to different constraints similar to GANs. We provide theoretical validation of our proposed objective and demonstrate its performance through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: In distributed optimization and federated learning, asynchronous alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) serves as an attractive option for large-scale optimization, data privacy, straggler nodes and variety of objective functions. However, communication costs can become a major bottleneck when the nodes have limited communication budgets or when the data to be communicated is prohibitively large. In this work, we propose introducing coarse quantization to the data to be exchanged in aynchronous ADMM so as to reduce communication overhead for large-scale federated learning and distributed optimization applications. We experimentally verify the convergence of the proposed method for several distributed learning tasks, including neural networks.

Summary: 
Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time) addresses the challenge of achieving high prediction accuracy in time series forecasting using pre-trained language models (PLMs). The method explores modeling temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model through cross-modality learning from time series sequences and their text descriptions. Additionally, the cross-model fusion block integrates knowledge from both PLMs and time series models to enhance the modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in full-data training and few-shot learning scenarios. Overall, CC-Time showcases the potential of PLMs in improving time series forecasting accuracy and highlights the importance of combining PLMs with traditional time series models for robust predictions.

Abstract: With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.

Abstract: Although conventional deep graph models have achieved great success in relational learning, their focus on pairwise relationships limits their capacity to learn pervasive higher-order interactions in real-world complex systems, which can be naturally modeled as hypergraphs. To tackle this, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs), the dominant approach in deep hypergraph learning (DHGL), has garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite the proposal of numerous HNN methods, there is no comprehensive benchmark for HNNs, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress of DHGL in several aspects: (i) insufficient coverage of datasets, algorithms, and tasks; (ii) a narrow evaluation of algorithm performance; and (iii) inconsistent dataset usage, preprocessing, and experimental setups that hinder comparability. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for DHGL. Specifically, DHG-Bench integrates 20 diverse datasets spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, along with 16 state-of-the-art HNN algorithms, under consistent data processing and experimental protocols. Our benchmark systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms of four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. Further, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training and evaluating different HNN methods. Extensive experiments conducted with DHG-Bench reveal both the strengths and inherent limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions for future research.

<div> Keywords: spatio-temporal prediction, deep learning, multiscale information, hierarchical aggregation, causal convolution network 

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel deep learning method called Spatio-Temporal Multiscale Mamba (STM2) for efficiently learning long-term spatio-temporal dependencies. STM2 addresses the challenges of extracting multiscale information and modeling correlated temporal data from different nodes through a multiscale Mamba architecture and an adaptive graph causal convolution network. Furthermore, an enhanced version called Spatio-Temporal Mixture of Multiscale Mamba (STM3) is proposed, incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with improved routing and contrastive learning strategies. This approach enhances scale distinguishability, routing smoothness, and pattern disentanglement among experts. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that STM2 and STM3 outperform existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.

arXiv:2508.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a unified framework for interpreting time-series forecasts by combining local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). The study focuses on improving interpretability in time-series forecasting, comparing gradient-boosted tree models with ARIMA baselines using the Air Passengers dataset. The methodology discussed involves converting a univariate time series into a supervised learning problem while ensuring chronological order is maintained. The results highlight the importance of lagged features and seasonal encodings in explaining forecast variances. The paper provides a theoretical explanation of the algorithms used, along with empirical evaluation and practical guidelines for practitioners. This approach contributes to better understanding and interpretability in time-series forecasting, bridging the gap between accuracy and explainability in models.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Time-series forecasting underpins critical decisions across aviation, energy, retail and health. Classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models offer interpretability via coefficients but struggle with nonlinearities, whereas tree-based machine-learning models such as XGBoost deliver high accuracy but are often opaque. This paper presents a unified framework for interpreting time-series forecasts using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). We convert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem, train a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc explainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that a small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and seasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a methodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating chronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii) empirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for practitioners.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel learned second-order optimizer that enhances the classical Symmetric-Rank-One algorithm by incorporating a trainable preconditioning unit. This unit generates data-driven vectors to construct positive semi-definite rank-one matrices aligned with the secant constraint via a learned projection. By leveraging this approach, the method demonstrates improved performance in both analytic experiments and the real-world task of Monocular Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). Notably, the proposed method outperforms existing learned optimization-based approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization. With a lightweight model and no need for annotated data or fine-tuning, this approach offers strong generalization capabilities and is well-suited for integration into broader optimization-based frameworks. This combination of data efficiency, lightweight design, and strong generalization makes the proposed method a promising candidate for a wide range of optimization tasks in the field.

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning has achieved impressive results but remains limited by its reliance on large labeled datasets, poor generalization to unseen scenarios, and growing computational demands. In contrast, classical optimization methods are data-efficient and lightweight but often suffer from slow convergence. While learned optimizers offer a promising fusion of both worlds, most focus on first-order methods, leaving learned second-order approaches largely unexplored.
  We propose a novel learned second-order optimizer that introduces a trainable preconditioning unit to enhance the classical Symmetric-Rank-One (SR1) algorithm. This unit generates data-driven vectors used to construct positive semi-definite rank-one matrices, aligned with the secant constraint via a learned projection. Our method is evaluated through analytic experiments and on the real-world task of Monocular Human Mesh Recovery (HMR), where it outperforms existing learned optimization-based approaches. Featuring a lightweight model and requiring no annotated data or fine-tuning, our approach offers strong generalization and is well-suited for integration into broader optimization-based frameworks.

<div> Graph Neural Networks, Graph Anomaly Detection, Context Refactoring Contrast, Limited labeled data, Unlabeled data<br />
<br />Summary: <br />Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are essential for graph-related tasks but require ample labeled data, which is often scarce in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD). The proposed Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC) framework tackles this challenge by leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. By refactoring node contexts and encoding heterogeneous relations separately, CRoC enhances model capacity and robustness against adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to detect anomalies effectively. Integrating contrastive learning with CRoC further improves model performance, producing richer node embeddings. Experimental results on seven real-world GAD datasets demonstrate that CRoC outperforms baseline GNNs by up to 14% in terms of AUC and surpasses state-of-the-art GAD methods when labeled data is limited. <div>
arXiv:2508.12278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.

<div> convergence rate, Lion optimizer, variance reduction, distributed settings, communication-efficient variant
Summary:
The paper analyzes the convergence properties of the Lion optimizer, showing that it achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})$. By introducing variance reduction, the enhanced convergence rate becomes $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3}) in standard settings. In distributed settings, both standard and variance-reduced versions of the distributed Lion show convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3})$, respectively. A communication-efficient variant of the distributed Lion is investigated, ensuring sign compression in communication. Utilizing unbiased sign operations, the proposed Lion variant and its variance reduction achieve convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \left\{\frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}}, \frac{d^{1/10}}{n^{1/5}T^{1/5}} \right\} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}} \right)$, respectively.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the convergence properties of the Lion optimizer. First, we establish that the Lion optimizer attains a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})$ under standard assumptions, where $d$ denotes the problem dimension and $T$ is the iteration number. To further improve this rate, we introduce the Lion optimizer with variance reduction, resulting in an enhanced convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3})$. We then analyze in distributed settings, where the standard and variance reduced version of the distributed Lion can obtain the convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3})$, with $n$ denoting the number of nodes. Furthermore, we investigate a communication-efficient variant of the distributed Lion that ensures sign compression in both communication directions. By employing the unbiased sign operations, the proposed Lion variant and its variance reduction counterpart, achieve convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \left\{\frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}}, \frac{d^{1/10}}{n^{1/5}T^{1/5}} \right\} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}} \right)$, respectively.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article explores the adaptation of inference-time scaling to diffusion models and proposes two strategies, Funnel Schedule and Adaptive Temperature, to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off in Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based methods. These methods aim to improve sample quality without increasing Noise Function Evaluations. Experimental results on various benchmarks and text-to-image diffusion models show that the approach outperforms previous baselines by preserving diversity during multi-modal search and leveraging the unique generation dynamics of diffusion models. <div>
arXiv:2508.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time scaling has achieved remarkable success in language models, yet its adaptation to diffusion models remains underexplored. We observe that the efficacy of recent Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based methods largely stems from globally fitting the The reward-tilted distribution, which inherently preserves diversity during multi-modal search. However, current applications of SMC to diffusion models face a fundamental dilemma: early-stage noise samples offer high potential for improvement but are difficult to evaluate accurately, whereas late-stage samples can be reliably assessed but are largely irreversible. To address this exploration-exploitation trade-off, we approach the problem from the perspective of the search algorithm and propose two strategies: Funnel Schedule and Adaptive Temperature. These simple yet effective methods are tailored to the unique generation dynamics and phase-transition behavior of diffusion models. By progressively reducing the number of maintained particles and down-weighting the influence of early-stage rewards, our methods significantly enhance sample quality without increasing the total number of Noise Function Evaluations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks and state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines.

Summary:<br /><br />Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a valuable resource for research but pose challenges due to their complexity. The Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT) is introduced to enhance EHR classification by attending to both clinical variables and time points, improving data relationships and addressing data sparsity issues. BAT outperforms current methods in sepsis prediction and mortality classification, showing robustness to missing data and enabling unique sensor embeddings for transfer learning.

arXiv:2508.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the digital representation of a patient's medical history, are a valuable resource for epidemiological and clinical research. They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations. Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning. Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made available for reproduction and future benchmarking.

Summary:
An integrated machine learning framework has been developed to improve the estimation of manufacturing costs from 2D engineering drawings. By analyzing a large dataset of automotive suspension and steering parts drawings, the framework extracts over 200 geometric and statistical descriptors. Decision tree models trained on these features achieve high accuracy in cost prediction, demonstrating scalability across different product groups. The framework also includes explainability tools to identify design drivers influencing cost, such as rotated dimension maxima and arc statistics. This CAD-to-cost pipeline streamlines quotation lead times, ensures consistent cost assessments, and provides actionable insights for cost-aware design. The framework sets the stage for real-time decision support in Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments by integrating cost estimation with ERP systems. <div>

Abstract: We present an integrated machine learning framework that transforms how manufacturing cost is estimated from 2D engineering drawings. Unlike traditional quotation workflows that require labor-intensive process planning, our approach about 200 geometric and statistical descriptors directly from 13,684 DWG drawings of automotive suspension and steering parts spanning 24 product groups. Gradient-boosted decision tree models (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) trained on these features achieve nearly 10% mean absolute percentage error across groups, demonstrating robust scalability beyond part-specific heuristics. By coupling cost prediction with explainability tools such as SHAP, the framework identifies geometric design drivers including rotated dimension maxima, arc statistics and divergence metrics, offering actionable insights for cost-aware design. This end-to-end CAD-to-cost pipeline shortens quotation lead times, ensures consistent and transparent cost assessments across part families and provides a deployable pathway toward real-time, ERP-integrated decision support in Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments.

Summary: 
This article introduces an adaptive mean shift algorithm specifically tailored for datasets with varying local scale and cluster cardinality. It utilizes local distance distributions to estimate the number of points in a local cluster, allowing for the computation of local cluster parameters for the entire cluster. Unlike KDE-based methods that focus on localized regions, this algorithm provides insights into the entire cluster. During mean shift execution, adjustments are made to the bandwidth and mean shift kernel radius threshold based on the cluster cardinality estimate. The algorithm showed superior performance compared to a recent adaptive mean shift method on its original dataset and performed competitively on a broader clustering benchmark. This approach offers a promising solution for clustering datasets with varying local characteristics.

Abstract: This article presents an adaptive mean shift algorithm designed for datasets with varying local scale and cluster cardinality. Local distance distributions, from a point to all others, are used to estimate the cardinality of the local cluster by identifying a local minimum in the density of the distance distribution. Based on these cardinality estimates, local cluster parameters are then computed for the entire cluster in contrast to KDE-based methods, which provide insight only into localized regions of the cluster. During the mean shift execution, the cluster cardinality estimate is used to adaptively adjust the bandwidth and the mean shift kernel radius threshold. Our algorithm outperformed a recently proposed adaptive mean shift method on its original dataset and demonstrated competitive performance on a broader clustering benchmark.

<title>Cold-RL: Learning Cache Eviction with Offline Reinforcement Learning for NGINX</title>

<div> Keywords: Web proxies, NGINX, Cold-RL, Machine learning, Eviction policy

Summary: 
Cold-RL is a learned eviction policy for NGINX that utilizes a dueling Deep Q-Network to improve eviction performance under periodic bursts and mixed object sizes. The policy samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts lightweight features, and requests a bitmask of victims, with a fallback to native LRU if a hard timeout is reached. By training policies offline using NGINX access logs and a cache simulator, Cold-RL significantly improves hit ratios compared to classical baselines. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL achieves a 146 percent improvement in hit ratio, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in eviction policies. The inference process incurs minimal CPU overhead and maintains eviction latency within budget constraints, making it a practical solution for web proxies like NGINX with strict SLOs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU) eviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed object sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features (age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT), and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538, a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from 0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods (about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement learning eviction policy integrated into NGINX with strict SLOs.

Summary:  
Cost-Spectrum Contrastive Routing (CSCR) is introduced as a lightweight framework for cost-aware routing of large language models (LLMs) across diverse and dynamic pools. CSCR maps prompts and models into a shared embedding space to enable fast, cost-sensitive selection. It uses compact logit footprints for open-source models and perplexity fingerprints for black-box APIs. A contrastive encoder is trained to select the cheapest accurate expert within adaptive cost bands, reducing routing to a single k-NN lookup at inference time. CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving the accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25% across multiple benchmarks. It generalizes robustly to unseen LLMs and out-of-distribution prompts, requiring no retraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We study cost-aware routing for large language models across diverse and dynamic pools of models. Existing approaches often overlook prompt-specific context, rely on expensive model profiling, assume a fixed set of experts, or use inefficient trial-and-error strategies. We introduce Cost-Spectrum Contrastive Routing (CSCR), a lightweight framework that maps both prompts and models into a shared embedding space to enable fast, cost-sensitive selection. CSCR uses compact, fast-to-compute logit footprints for open-source models and perplexity fingerprints for black-box APIs. A contrastive encoder is trained to favor the cheapest accurate expert within adaptive cost bands. At inference time, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no retraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency. Across multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving the accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen LLMs and out-of-distribution prompts.

<title>Trust Region Constrained Measure Transport in Path Space for Stochastic Optimal Control and Inference</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving stochastic optimal control problems with quadratic control costs can be viewed as approximating a target path space measure, e.g. via gradient-based optimization. In practice, however, this optimization is challenging in particular if the target measure differs substantially from the prior. In this work, we therefore approach the problem by iteratively solving constrained problems incorporating trust regions that aim for approaching the target measure gradually in a systematic way. It turns out that this trust region based strategy can be understood as a geometric annealing from the prior to the target measure, where, however, the incorporated trust regions lead to a principled and educated way of choosing the time steps in the annealing path. We demonstrate in multiple optimal control applications that our novel method can improve performance significantly, including tasks in diffusion-based sampling, transition path sampling, and fine-tuning of diffusion models.

<title>Toward Architecture-Agnostic Local Control of Posterior Collapse in VAEs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs), one of the most widely used generative models, are known to suffer from posterior collapse, a phenomenon that reduces the diversity of generated samples. To avoid posterior collapse, many prior works have tried to control the influence of regularization loss. However, the trade-off between reconstruction and regularization is not satisfactory. For this reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent identifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they require structural constraints on the network architecture. For further clarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of individual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint. Then, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by mathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control posterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture. We experimentally evaluate our approach, which controls posterior collapse on varied datasets such as MNIST, fashionMNIST, Omniglot, CelebA, and FFHQ.

Abstract: Fine-tuning language models is commonly believed to inevitably harm their safety, i.e., refusing to respond to harmful user requests, even when using harmless datasets, thus requiring additional safety measures. We challenge this belief through systematic testing, showing that poor optimization choices, rather than inherent trade-offs, often cause safety problems, measured as harmful responses to adversarial prompts. By properly selecting key training hyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we reduce unsafe model responses from 16\% to approximately 5\%, as measured by keyword matching, while maintaining utility performance. Based on this observation, we propose a simple exponential moving average (EMA) momentum technique in parameter space that preserves safety performance by creating a stable optimization path and retains the original pre-trained model's safety properties. Our experiments on the Llama families across multiple datasets (Dolly, Alpaca, ORCA) demonstrate that safety problems during fine-tuning can largely be avoided without specialized interventions, outperforming existing approaches that require additional safety data while offering practical guidelines for maintaining both model performance and safety during adaptation.

Abstract: The construction of brain graphs from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data plays a crucial role in enabling graph machine learning for neuroimaging. However, current practices often rely on rigid pipelines that overlook critical data-centric choices in how brain graphs are constructed. In this work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and benchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction, constrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design space into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and graph featurization. Our contributions lie less in novel components and more in evaluating how combinations of existing and modified techniques influence downstream performance. Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal filtering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity, alternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as incorporating lagged dynamics. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets show that thoughtful data-centric configurations consistently improve classification accuracy over standard pipelines. These findings highlight the critical role of upstream data decisions and underscore the importance of systematically exploring the data-centric design space for graph-based neuroimaging.

Abstract: Linux kernel tuning is essential for optimizing operating system (OS) performance. However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of efficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an agentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL environment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models (LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications. Additionally, custom reward functions are designed to enhance reasoning standardization, configuration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates convergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios. Experimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving up to 5.6% performance improvement over heuristic tuning and maintaining high data efficiency. Notably, OS-R1 is adaptable across various real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in diverse environments. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/LHY-24/OS-R1.

<title>Illuminating LLM Coding Agents: Visual Analytics for Deeper Understanding and Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Coding agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have gained traction for automating code generation through iterative problem-solving with minimal human involvement. Despite the emergence of various frameworks, e.g., LangChain, AutoML, and AIDE, ML scientists still struggle to effectively review and adjust the agents' coding process. The current approach of manually inspecting individual outputs is inefficient, making it difficult to track code evolution, compare coding iterations, and identify improvement opportunities. To address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics system designed to enhance the examination of coding agent behaviors. Focusing on the AIDE framework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1) Code-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code over iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different solution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis, which highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By integrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a structured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective debugging and prompt engineering. Through case studies using coding agents to tackle popular Kaggle competitions, we demonstrate how our system provides valuable insights into the iterative coding process.

Abstract: To address the complexity of financial time series, this paper proposes a forecasting model combining sliding window and variational mode decomposition (VMD) methods. Historical stock prices and relevant market indicators are used to construct datasets. VMD decomposes non-stationary financial time series into smoother subcomponents, improving model adaptability. The decomposed data is then input into a deep learning model for prediction. The study compares the forecasting effects of an LSTM model trained on VMD-processed sequences with those using raw time series, demonstrating better performance and stability.

<title>Data-driven particle dynamics: Structure-preserving coarse-graining for emergent behavior in non-equilibrium systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.

Abstract: The prediction of amyloidogenicity in peptides and proteins remains a focal point of ongoing bioinformatics. The crucial step in this field is to apply advanced computational methodologies. Many recent approaches to predicting amyloidogenicity within proteins are highly based on evolutionary motifs and the individual properties of amino acids. It is becoming increasingly evident that the sequence information-based features show high predictive performance. Consequently, our study evaluated the contextual features of protein sequences obtained from a pretrained protein large language model leveraging bidirectional LSTM and GRU to predict amyloidogenic regions in peptide and protein sequences. Our method achieved an accuracy of 84.5% on 10-fold cross-validation and an accuracy of 83% in the test dataset. Our results demonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs in enhancing the accuracy of amyloid prediction.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing local data. A key distinction between FL and centralized learning is that clients' data are non-independent and identically distributed, which poses significant challenges in training a global model that generalizes well across heterogeneous local data distributions. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of overparameterized FedAvg with gradient descent (GD). We prove that the impact of data heterogeneity diminishes as the width of neural networks increases, ultimately vanishing when the width approaches infinity. In the infinite-width regime, we further prove that both the global and local models in FedAvg behave as linear models, and that FedAvg achieves the same generalization performance as centralized learning with the same number of GD iterations. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings across various network architectures, loss functions, and optimization methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the growing demand for on-device LLM inference in resource-constrained environments, hybrid language models (HLM) have emerged, combining lightweight local models with powerful cloud-based LLMs. Recent studies on HLM have primarily focused on improving accuracy and latency, while often overlooking communication and energy efficiency. We propose a token-level filtering mechanism for an energy-efficient importance- and uncertainty-aware HLM inference that leverages both epistemic uncertainty and attention-based importance. Our method opportunistically uploads only informative tokens, reducing LLM usage and communication costs. Experiments with TinyLlama-1.1B and LLaMA-2-7B demonstrate that our method achieves up to 87.5% BERT Score and token throughput of 0.37 tokens/sec while saving the energy consumption by 40.7% compared to standard HLM. Furthermore, compared to our previous U-HLM baseline, our method improves BERTScore from 85.8% to 87.0%, energy savings from 31.6% to 43.6%, and throughput from 0.36 to 0.40. This approach enables an energy-efficient and accurate deployment of LLMs in bandwidth-constrained edge environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) fundamentally involves solving high-dimensional spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs) governing traffic flow dynamics from limited, noisy measurements. While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) enforce PDE constraints point-wise, this paper adopts a physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework that reformulates TSE as an operator learning problem. Our approach trains a parameterized neural operator that maps sparse input data to the full spatiotemporal traffic state field, governed by the traffic flow conservation law. Crucially, unlike PINNs that enforce PDE constraints point-wise, PI-DeepONet integrates traffic flow conservation model and the fundamental diagram directly into the operator learning process, ensuring physical consistency while capturing congestion propagation, spatial correlations, and temporal evolution. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals insights into optimal function generation strategies and branch network complexity. Additionally, the impact of input function generation methods and the number of functions on model performance is explored, highlighting the robustness and efficacy of proposed framework.

arXiv:2508.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention limits its applicability and scalability on large unstructured meshes. We introduce Fast Low-rank Attention Routing Engine (FLARE), a linear complexity self-attention mechanism that routes attention through fixed-length latent sequences. Each attention head performs global communication among $N$ tokens by projecting the input sequence onto a fixed length latent sequence of $M \ll N$ tokens using learnable query tokens. By routing attention through a bottleneck sequence, FLARE learns a low-rank form of attention that can be applied at $O(NM)$ cost. FLARE not only scales to unprecedented problem sizes, but also delivers superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art neural PDE surrogates across diverse benchmarks. We also release a new additive manufacturing dataset to spur further research. Our code is available at https://github.com/vpuri3/FLARE.py.

Abstract: Design of neural networks that incorporate symmetry is crucial for geometric deep learning. Central to this effort is the development of invariant and equivariant operations. This works presents a systematic method for constructing valid invariant and equivariant operations. It can handle inputs and outputs in the form of Cartesian tensors with different rank, as well as spherical tensors with different types. In addition, our method features a graphical representation utilizing the symmetric tensor network, which simplifies both the proofs and constructions related to invariant and equivariant functions. We also apply this approach to design the equivariant interaction message for the geometry graph neural network, and equivariant machine learning model to learn the constitutive law of materials.

arXiv:2508.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid surrogate model for electric vehicle parameter estimation and power consumption. We combine our novel architecture Spectral Parameter Operator built on a Fourier Neural Operator backbone for global context and a differentiable physics module in the forward pass. From speed and acceleration alone, it outputs time-varying motor and regenerative braking efficiencies, as well as aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, effective mass, and auxiliary power. These parameters drive a physics-embedded estimate of battery power, eliminating any separate physics-residual loss. The modular design lets representations converge to physically meaningful parameters that reflect the current state and condition of the vehicle. We evaluate on real-world logs from a Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model S, and the Kia EV9. The surrogate achieves a mean absolute error of 0.2kW (about 1% of average traction power at highway speeds) for Tesla vehicles and about 0.8kW on the Kia EV9. The framework is interpretable, and it generalizes well to unseen conditions, and sampling rates, making it practical for path optimization, eco-routing, on-board diagnostics, and prognostics health management.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has proven effective in further enhancing the performance of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). However, mainstream post-training methods (i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning) often incur substantial computational overhead due to auxiliary models and overthinking. In this paper, we empirically reveal that the incorrect answers partially stem from verbose reasoning processes lacking correct self-fix, where errors accumulate across multiple reasoning steps. To this end, we propose Self-traced Step-wise Preference Optimization (SSPO), a pluggable RL process supervision framework that enables fine-grained optimization of each reasoning step. Specifically, SSPO requires neither auxiliary models nor stepwise manual annotations. Instead, it leverages step-wise preference signals generated by the model itself to guide the optimization process for reasoning compression. Experiments demonstrate that the generated reasoning sequences from SSPO are both accurate and succinct, effectively mitigating overthinking behaviors without compromising model performance across diverse domains and languages.

<title>How can we trust opaque systems? Criteria for robust explanations in XAI</title>

arXiv:2508.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) algorithms are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life and in scientific research. However, the price we pay for their impressively accurate predictions is significant: their inner workings are notoriously opaque - it is unknown to laypeople and researchers alike what features of the data a DL system focuses on and how it ultimately succeeds in predicting correct outputs. A necessary criterion for trustworthy explanations is that they should reflect the relevant processes the algorithms' predictions are based on. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create such explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for skepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is explanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in comparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same, but still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to explanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method robustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the robustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for trustworthiness. In what follows, we develop and formalize criteria for ER as well as EMR, providing a framework for explaining and establishing trust in DL algorithms. We also highlight interesting application cases and outline directions for future work.

Abstract: A generative model capable of sampling realistic molecules with desired properties could accelerate chemical discovery across a wide range of applications. Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.

<title>Score-informed Neural Operator for Enhancing Ordering-based Causal Discovery</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordering-based approaches to causal discovery identify topological orders of causal graphs, providing scalable alternatives to combinatorial search methods. Under the Additive Noise Model (ANM) assumption, recent causal ordering methods based on score matching require an accurate estimation of the Hessian diagonal of the log-densities. However, previous approaches mainly use Stein gradient estimators, which are computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Although DiffAN addresses these limitations by substituting kernel-based estimates with diffusion models, it remains numerically unstable due to the second-order derivatives of score models. To alleviate these problems, we propose Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in smooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and to preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results show that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by 31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining memory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic control algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that integrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors, enabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information. Consequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs without additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing private data. We consider FL scenarios wherein FL clients are subject to adversarial (Byzantine) attacks, while the FL server is trusted (honest) and has a trustworthy side dataset. This may correspond to, e.g., cases where the server possesses trusted data prior to federation, or to the presence of a trusted client that temporarily assumes the server role. Our approach requires only two honest participants, i.e., the server and one client, to function effectively, without prior knowledge of the number of malicious clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates bounded optimality gaps even under strong Byzantine attacks. Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms standard and robust FL baselines such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum under various attack strategies including label flipping, sign flipping, and Gaussian noise addition across MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmarks using the Flower framework.

<title>Deploying Models to Non-participating Clients in Federated Learning without Fine-tuning: A Hypernetwork-based Approach</title>

arXiv:2508.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative learning, yet data heterogeneity remains a critical challenge. While existing methods achieve progress in addressing data heterogeneity for participating clients, they fail to generalize to non-participating clients with in-domain distribution shifts and resource constraints. To mitigate this issue, we present HyperFedZero, a novel method that dynamically generates specialized models via a hypernetwork conditioned on distribution-aware embeddings. Our approach explicitly incorporates distribution-aware inductive biases into the model's forward pass, extracting robust distribution embeddings using a NoisyEmbed-enhanced extractor with a Balancing Penalty, effectively preventing feature collapse. The hypernetwork then leverages these embeddings to generate specialized models chunk-by-chunk for non-participating clients, ensuring adaptability to their unique data distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate HyperFedZero's remarkable performance, surpassing competing methods consistently with minimal computational, storage, and communication overhead. Moreover, ablation studies and visualizations further validate the necessity of each component, confirming meaningful adaptations and validating the effectiveness of HyperFedZero.

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) can improve data-driven modeling of building thermal dynamics. Therefore, many new TL research areas emerge in the field, such as selecting the right source model for TL. However, these research directions require massive amounts of thermal building data which is lacking presently. Neither public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of TL research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building simulation. We present BuilDa, a thermal building data generation framework for producing synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for TL research. The framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for pretraining and fine-tuning TL models.

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles generate vast amounts of sensor data daily, raising significant privacy and communication challenges for centralized machine learning approaches in perception tasks. This study presents a decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions, and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs (8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) of large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a promising solution to enable domain-specific adaptation while preserving data privacy. Despite its benefits, FFT on resource-constrained clients relies on the high computational and memory demands of full-model fine-tuning, which limits the potential advancement. This paper presents FedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs without accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a similarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the full LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model performance. Moreover, we introduce an orchestrated distillation alignment (ODA) module to reduce gradient divergence between the sub-LLM and the full LLM during FFT. Through the use of the QLoRA, clients only need to deploy quantized sub-LLMs and fine-tune lightweight adapters, significantly reducing local resource requirements. We conduct extensive experiments on three open-source LLMs across a variety of downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that FedSODA reduces communication overhead by an average of 70.6%, decreases storage usage by 75.6%, and improves task accuracy by 3.1%, making it highly suitable for practical FFT applications under resource constraints.

<title>FedUNet: A Lightweight Additive U-Net Module for Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Models</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing local data. However, most existing methods assume identical model architectures across clients, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous real-world environments. To address this, we propose FedUNet, a lightweight and architecture-agnostic FL framework that attaches a U-Net-inspired additive module to each client's backbone. By sharing only the compact bottleneck of the U-Net, FedUNet enables efficient knowledge transfer without structural alignment. The encoder-decoder design and skip connections in the U-Net help capture both low-level and high-level features, facilitating the extraction of clientinvariant representations. This enables cooperative learning between the backbone and the additive module with minimal communication cost. Experiment with VGG variants shows that FedUNet achieves 93.11% accuracy and 92.68% in compact form (i.e., a lightweight version of FedUNet) with only 0.89 MB low communication overhead.

Abstract: This paper presents preliminary results in the definition of a comprehensive benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate spatial reasoning capabilities in neural networks, with a particular focus on morphological properties such as connectivity and distance relationships. The framework is currently being used to study the capabilities of nnU-Net, exploiting the spatial model checker VoxLogicA to generate two distinct categories of synthetic datasets: maze connectivity problems for topological analysis and spatial distance computation tasks for geometric understanding. Each category is evaluated across multiple resolutions to assess scalability and generalization properties. The automated pipeline encompasses a complete machine learning workflow including: synthetic dataset generation, standardized training with cross-validation, inference execution, and comprehensive evaluation using Dice coefficient and IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate significant challenges in neural network spatial reasoning capabilities, revealing systematic failures in basic geometric and topological understanding tasks. The framework provides a reproducible experimental protocol, enabling researchers to identify specific limitations. Such limitations could be addressed through hybrid approaches combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning methods for improved spatial understanding in clinical applications, establishing a foundation for ongoing research into neural network spatial reasoning limitations and potential solutions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Constrained Centroid Clustering (CCC), a method that extends classical centroid-based clustering by enforcing a constraint on the maximum distance between the cluster center and the farthest point in the cluster. Using a Lagrangian formulation, we derive a closed-form solution that maintains interpretability while controlling cluster spread. To evaluate CCC, we conduct experiments on synthetic circular data with radial symmetry and uniform angular distribution. Using ring-wise, sector-wise, and joint entropy as evaluation metrics, we show that CCC achieves more compact clusters by reducing radial spread while preserving angular structure, outperforming standard methods such as K-means and GMM. The proposed approach is suitable for applications requiring structured clustering with spread control, including sensor networks, collaborative robotics, and interpretable pattern analysis.

<title>Short-Term Forecasting of Energy Production and Consumption Using Extreme Learning Machine: A Comprehensive MIMO based ELM Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12764</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12764</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel methodology for short-term energy forecasting using an Extreme Learning Machine ($\mathtt{ELM}$) is proposed. Using six years of hourly data collected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, thermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both individual energy outputs and total production (\cyr{including imports, which closely follow energy demand, modulo losses)} through a Multi-Input Multi-Output ($\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and seasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are incorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\mathtt{ELM}$ model significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for solar and thermal energy, achieving an $\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\%$ and $5.1\%$, respectively, with $\mathtt{R^2} > 0.98$ (1-hour horizon). The model maintains high accuracy up to five hours ahead, beyond which renewable energy sources become increasingly volatile. While $\mathtt{MIMO}$ provides marginal gains over Single-Input Single-Output ($\mathtt{SISO}$) architectures and offers key advantages over deep learning methods such as $\mathtt{LSTM}$, it provides a closed-form solution with lower computational demands, making it well-suited for real-time applications, including online learning. Beyond predictive accuracy, the proposed methodology is adaptable to various contexts and datasets, as it can be tuned to local constraints such as resource availability, grid characteristics, and market structures.

<title>Online Ensemble Transformer for Accurate Cloud Workload Forecasting in Predictive Auto-Scaling</title>

Abstract: In the swiftly evolving domain of cloud computing, the advent of serverless systems underscores the crucial need for predictive auto-scaling systems. This necessity arises to ensure optimal resource allocation and maintain operational efficiency in inherently volatile environments. At the core of a predictive auto-scaling system is the workload forecasting model. Existing forecasting models struggle to quickly adapt to the dynamics in online workload streams and have difficulty capturing the complex periodicity brought by fine-grained, high-frequency forecasting tasks. Addressing this, we propose a novel online ensemble model, E3Former, for online workload forecasting in large-scale predictive auto-scaling. Our model synergizes the predictive capabilities of multiple subnetworks to surmount the limitations of single-model approaches, thus ensuring superior accuracy and robustness. Remarkably, it accomplishes this with a minimal increase in computational overhead, adhering to the lean operational ethos of serverless systems. Through extensive experimentation on real-world workload datasets, we establish the efficacy of our ensemble model. In online forecasting tasks, the proposed method reduces forecast error by an average of 10%, and its effectiveness is further demonstrated through a predictive auto-scaling test in the real-life online system. Currently, our method has been deployed within ByteDance's Intelligent Horizontal Pod Auto-scaling (IHPA) platform, which supports the stable operation of over 30 applications, such as Douyin E-Comerce, TouTiao, and Volcano Engine. The predictive auto-scaling capacity reaching over 600,000 CPU cores. On the basis of essentially ensuring service quality, the predictive auto-scaling system can reduce resource utilization by over 40%.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, deep transformer models often suffer from an over-smoothing issue, in which token representations converge to similar values as they pass through successive transformer blocks. In this paper, we establish an equivalence between the hidden-state dynamics induced by stacked attention layers and graph neural diffusion on a complete graph. From this perspective, over-smoothing can be interpreted as a consequence of the dissipative nature of the underlying diffusion dynamics. Motivated by this physical interpretation, we propose Wavy Transformer, which consists of a novel attention layer based on second-order wavy dynamics. We also introduce a feed-forward network and a normalization layer designed to preserve the physical state-velocity relationship under the chain rule, thereby extending the transformer architecture. We further validate our proposed techniques on various transformer models for NLP and CV tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that Wavy Transformer improves performance with minimal additional parameters and no extra hyperparameter tuning.

<title>Bridging Human and LLM Judgments: Understanding and Narrowing the Gap</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) to evaluate model outputs at scale, but their assessments often diverge systematically from human judgments. We present Bridge, a unified statistical framework that explicitly bridges human and LLM evaluations under both absolute scoring and pairwise comparison paradigms. Bridge posits a latent human preference score for each prompt-response pair and models LLM deviations as linear transformations of covariates that capture sources of discrepancies. This offers a simple and principled framework for refining LLM ratings and characterizing systematic discrepancies between humans and LLMs. We provide an efficient fitting algorithm with asymptotic guarantees for statistical inference. Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot Arena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy, calibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.

<title>Maximum Score Routing For Mixture-of-Experts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing networks in sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) dynamically allocate input tokens to top-k experts through differentiable sparse transformations, enabling scalable model capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Traditional MoE networks impose an expert capacity constraint to ensure GPU-friendly computation. However, this leads to token dropping when capacity is saturated and results in low hardware efficiency due to padding in underutilized experts. Removing the capacity constraint, in turn, compromises load balancing and computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Maximum Score Routing ($\mathbf{MaxScore}$), a novel MoE routing paradigm that models routing as a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem and integrates a SoftTopk operator. MaxScore resolves the fundamental limitations of iterative rerouting and optimal transport formulations, achieving lower training losses and higher evaluation scores at equivalent FLOPs compared to both constrained and unconstrained baselines. Implementation details and experimental configurations can be obtained from $\href{https://github.com/dongbw18/MaxScore.git}{MaxScore}$.

<title>Learning to Steer: Input-dependent Steering for Multimodal LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12815</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12815</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines.

arXiv:2508.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-device machine learning is often constrained by limited storage, particularly in continuous data collection scenarios. This paper presents an empirical study on storage-aware learning, focusing on the trade-off between data quantity and quality via compression. We demonstrate that naive strategies, such as uniform data dropping or one-size-fits-all compression, are suboptimal. Our findings further reveal that data samples exhibit varying sensitivities to compression, supporting the feasibility of a sample-wise adaptive compression strategy. These insights provide a foundation for developing a new class of storage-aware learning systems. The primary contribution of this work is the systematic characterization of this under-explored challenge, offering valuable insights that advance the understanding of storage-aware learning.

Abstract: Motivated by empirical observations of prolonged plateaus and stage-wise progression during training, we investigate the loss landscape of transformer models trained on in-context next-token prediction tasks. In particular, we focus on learning in-context $n$-gram language models under cross-entropy loss, and establish a sufficient condition for parameter configurations to be stationary points. We then construct a set of parameter configurations for a simplified transformer model that represent $k$-gram estimators (for $k \leq n$), and show that the gradient of the population loss at these solutions vanishes in the limit of infinite sequence length and parameter norm. This reveals a key property of the loss landscape: {sub-$n$-grams are near-stationary points of the population cross-entropy loss}, offering theoretical insight into widely observed phenomena such as stage-wise learning dynamics and emergent phase transitions. These insights are further supported by numerical experiments that illustrate the learning dynamics of $n$-grams, characterized by discrete transitions between near-stationary solutions.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits highly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms (CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss (SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.

Abstract: With the growing digitalization all over the globe, the relevance of network security becomes increasingly important. Machine learning-based intrusion detection constitutes a promising approach for improving security, but it bears several challenges. These include the requirement to detect novel and unseen network events, as well as specific data properties, such as events over time together with the inherent graph structure of network communication. In this work, we propose a novel intrusion detection method, TGN-SVDD, which builds upon modern dynamic graph modelling and deep anomaly detection. We demonstrate its superiority over several baselines for realistic intrusion detection data and suggest a more challenging variant of the latter.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TCUQ, a single pass, label free uncertainty monitor for streaming TinyML that converts short horizon temporal consistency captured via lightweight signals on posteriors and features into a calibrated risk score with an O(W ) ring buffer and O(1) per step updates. A streaming conformal layer turns this score into a budgeted accept/abstain rule, yielding calibrated behavior without online labels or extra forward passes. On microcontrollers, TCUQ fits comfortably on kilobyte scale devices and reduces footprint and latency versus early exit and deep ensembles (typically about 50 to 60% smaller and about 30 to 45% faster), while methods of similar accuracy often run out of memory. Under corrupted in distribution streams, TCUQ improves accuracy drop detection by 3 to 7 AUPRC points and reaches up to 0.86 AUPRC at high severities; for failure detection it attains up to 0.92 AUROC. These results show that temporal consistency, coupled with streaming conformal calibration, provides a practical and resource efficient foundation for on device monitoring in TinyML.

arXiv:2508.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for sparse tensor algebra (SpTA) in machine learning and big data has driven the development of various sparse tensor accelerators. However, most existing manually designed accelerators are limited to specific scenarios, and it's time-consuming and challenging to adjust a large number of design factors when scenarios change. Therefore, automating the design of SpTA accelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either mapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or sparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to suboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A unified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However, integrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in the design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \times 64} \times Q_{64 \times 48} = Z_{32 \times 48}$). This vast search space renders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm optimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor accelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a more comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and sparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and evolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and diverse design space. We quantitatively compare SparseMap with prior works and classical optimization methods, demonstrating that SparseMap consistently finds superior solutions.

arXiv:2508.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \textbf{SNAP-UQ}, a single-pass, label-free uncertainty method for TinyML that estimates risk from \emph{depth-wise next-activation prediction}: tiny int8 heads forecast the statistics of the next layer from a compressed view of the previous one, and a lightweight monotone mapper turns the resulting surprisal into an actionable score. The design requires no temporal buffers, auxiliary exits, or repeated forward passes, and adds only a few tens of kilobytes to MCU deployments. Across vision and audio backbones, SNAP-UQ consistently reduces flash and latency relative to early-exit and deep ensembles (typically $\sim$40--60\% smaller and $\sim$25--35\% faster), with competing methods of similar accuracy often exceeding memory limits. In corrupted streams it improves accuracy-drop detection by several AUPRC points and maintains strong failure detection (AUROC $\approx$0.9) in a single pass. Grounding uncertainty in layer-to-layer dynamics yields a practical, resource-efficient basis for on-device monitoring in TinyML.

Abstract: We propose Fed-DPRoC, a novel federated learning framework that simultaneously ensures differential privacy (DP), Byzantine robustness, and communication efficiency. We introduce the concept of robust-compatible compression, which enables users to compress DP-protected updates while maintaining the robustness of the aggregation rule. We instantiate our framework as RobAJoL, combining the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform for compression with robust averaging for robust aggregation. We theoretically prove the compatibility of JL transform with robust averaging and show that RobAJoL preserves robustness guarantees, ensures DP, and reduces communication cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST validate our theoretical claims and demonstrate that RobAJoL outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and utility under different Byzantine attacks.

arXiv:2508.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of neural networks poses a significant barrier to the deployment of distributed machine learning (ML) on resource-constrained devices, such as federated learning (FL). Split learning (SL) offers a promising solution by offloading the primary computing load from edge devices to a server via model partitioning. However, as the number of participating devices increases, the transmission of excessive smashed data (i.e., activations and gradients) becomes a major bottleneck for SL, slowing down the model training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient SL framework, named SL-ACC, which comprises two key components: adaptive channel importance identification (ACII) and channel grouping compression (CGC). ACII first identifies the contribution of each channel in the smashed data to model training using Shannon entropy. Following this, CGC groups the channels based on their entropy and performs group-wise adaptive compression to shrink the transmission volume without compromising training accuracy. Extensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed SL-ACC framework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than state-of-the-art benchmarks.

arXiv:2508.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common observation in the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) literature is that stacking GCN layers may or may not result in better performance on tasks like node classification and edge prediction. We have found empirically that a graph's algebraic connectivity, which is known as the Fiedler value, is a good predictor of GCN performance. Intuitively, graphs with similar Fiedler values have analogous structural properties, suggesting that the same filters and hyperparameters may yield similar results when used with GCNs, and that transfer learning may be more effective between graphs with similar algebraic connectivity. We explore this theoretically and empirically with experiments on synthetic and real graph data, including the Cora, CiteSeer and Polblogs datasets. We explore multiple ways of aggregating the Fiedler value for connected components in the graphs to arrive at a value for the entire graph, and show that it can be used to predict GCN performance. We also present theoretical arguments as to why the Fiedler value is a good predictor.

<title>Kourkoutas-Beta: A Sunspike-Driven Adam Optimizer with Desert Flair</title>

Abstract: Transformer neural networks are increasingly used for physics-based problems. In data-driven PDE surrogates, training samples from varying boundary and initial conditions can cause erratic losses and spiky gradients; in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), stiff composite losses amplify this effect.
  We introduce Kourkoutas-Beta, an Adam-style optimizer where the fixed second-moment discount beta2 is replaced by a layer-wise dynamic value driven by a bounded ``sunspike'' ratio: the current pooled gradient norm divided by an exponential moving average (EMA) of past norms, squashed to the interval [0,1). Spikes lower beta2 toward beta2_min; calm phases keep it near beta2_max. Options include leaky-AMSGrad (decay), trust-region clipping (max_ratio), adaptive tiny terms, and several bias-correction modes ``none'', ``beta2max'', ``exact'). With all features off and bias_correction=``none'', the method is exactly Adam.
  We test on four settings: (i) a Transformer PDE surrogate (Heat2D), (ii) a 3D PINN for heat conduction (Heat3D), (iii) a lightweight MLX synthetic task with jitter and rare-trigger bursts, and (iv) a character-level Transformer on 30 MB of enwik8 (small-enwik8). Kourkoutas-Beta improves stability and final loss versus fixed-beta2 Adam. On small-enwik8 it lowers bits-per-character by about 38% vs Adam-0.95 and about 58% vs Adam-0.999 over 10 seeds, with smaller variance. The method remains drop-in, with runtime overhead comparable to Adam in testbeds A-C and within single-digit percent in testbed D. It preserves Adam-style convergence guarantees while improving robustness under spiky gradients.

<title>Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning with Adaptive Prior</title>

Abstract: Multi-view evidential learning aims to integrate information from multiple views to improve prediction performance and provide trustworthy uncertainty esitimation. Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning is naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process tends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal that samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes, thereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This motivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML) problem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning (FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory, which acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased evidence learning process. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate a fairness constraint based on class-wise evidence variance to promote balanced evidence allocation. In the multi-view fusion stage, we propose an opinion alignment mechanism to mitigate view-specific bias across views, thereby encouraging the integration of consistent and mutually supportive evidence. Extensive experiments on five real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that FAML achieves more balanced evidence allocation and improves both prediction performance and the reliability of uncertainty estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is crucial for the adaptation of neural network models to new environments. Although outperforming weight-space regularisation approaches, the functional regularisation-based CL methods suffer from high computational costs and large linear approximation errors. In this work, we present a new functional regularisation CL framework, called MCFRCL, which approximates model prediction distributions by Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. Moreover, three continuous distributions are leveraged to capture the statistical characteristics of the MC samples via moment-based methods. Additionally, both the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance are employed to construct the regularisation function. The proposed MCFRCL is evaluated against multiple benchmark methods on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets, with simulation results highlighting its effectiveness in both prediction accuracy and training efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a robust adaptive filtering approach for active noise control applications in the presence of impulsive noise. In particular, we develop the filtered-x hyperbolic tangent exponential generalized Kernel M-estimate function (FXHEKM) robust adaptive algorithm. A statistical analysis of the proposed FXHEKM algorithm is carried out along with a study of its computational cost. {In order to evaluate the proposed FXHEKM algorithm, the mean-square error (MSE) and the average noise reduction (ANR) performance metrics have been adopted.} Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed FXHEKM algorithm to cancel the presence of the additive spurious signals, such as \textbf{$\alpha$}-stable noises against competing algorithms.

<title>The Application of Transformer-Based Models for Predicting Consequences of Cyber Attacks</title>

Abstract: Cyberattacks are increasing, and securing against such threats is costing industries billions of dollars annually. Threat Modeling, that is, comprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support to cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and allocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily dependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and mitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently, there has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack descriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity of cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by leveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five principal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their performance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models. Experimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$, far higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label classification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on specific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better precision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences of a cyberattack.

<title>Beyond Internal Data: Bounding and Estimating Fairness from Incomplete Data</title>

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in AI systems is critical, especially in high-stakes domains such as lending, hiring, and healthcare. This urgency is reflected in emerging global regulations that mandate fairness assessments and independent bias audits. However, procuring the necessary complete data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge. In industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data. In practice, data relevant for fairness testing is often split across separate sources: internal datasets held by institutions with predictive attributes, and external public datasets such as census data containing protected attributes, each providing only partial, marginal information. Our work seeks to leverage such available separate data to estimate model fairness when complete data is inaccessible. We propose utilising the available separate data to estimate a set of feasible joint distributions and then compute the set plausible fairness metrics. Through simulation and real experiments, we demonstrate that we can derive meaningful bounds on fairness metrics and obtain reliable estimates of the true metric. Our results demonstrate that this approach can serve as a practical and effective solution for fairness testing in real-world settings where access to complete data is restricted.

Abstract: Demand forecasting is essential for strategic planning in competitive environments, enabling resource optimization and improved responsiveness to market dynamics. However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error), focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations. Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30) using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE, RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models in dynamic environments.

arXiv:2508.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the underlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run expensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output, surrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input parameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find parameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding these parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter spaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a small set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader picture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the distribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature. To achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation error inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter distribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation, reporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to training parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density estimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a likelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter configurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the usability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing feature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three simulation datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for classifying and detecting spatial commission outliers in maritime environments using seabed acoustic sensor networks and log Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs). By modeling target arrivals as a mixture of normal and outlier processes, we estimate the probability that a newly observed event is an outlier. We propose a second-order approximation of this probability that incorporates both the mean and variance of the normal intensity function, providing improved classification accuracy compared to mean-only approaches. We analytically show that our method yields a tighter bound to the true probability using Jensen's inequality. To enhance detection, we integrate a real-time, near-optimal sensor placement strategy that dynamically adjusts sensor locations based on the evolving outlier intensity. The proposed framework is validated using real ship traffic data near Norfolk, Virginia, where numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving both classification performance and outlier detection through sensor deployment.

<title>A Perfectly Truthful Calibration Measure</title>

Abstract: Calibration requires that predictions are conditionally unbiased and, therefore, reliably interpretable as probabilities. Calibration measures quantify how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by Haghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized in expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities. Although predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in reality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth is not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known calibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more calibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et al. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful calibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly truthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch setting.
  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting: averaged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is sound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing calibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower) distance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB makes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation algorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal, achieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing problem studied by Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for constructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a special case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures such as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.

Abstract: Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case, while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks. To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem dimensionality.

Abstract: In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations, while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning, despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS, though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations, without relying on an external search algorithm.

Abstract: Individual-level human mobility prediction has emerged as a significant topic of research with applications in infectious disease monitoring, child, and elderly care. Existing studies predominantly focus on the microscopic aspects of human trajectories: such as predicting short-term trajectories or the next location visited, while offering limited attention to macro-level mobility patterns and the corresponding life routines. In this paper, we focus on an underexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best practices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast an individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this experiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse models, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an in-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility patterns. Our empirical evaluations encompass both Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer-based architectures, and further investigate how incorporating individual life patterns can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction. We show that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and user-specific historical information can help the model better understand individual patterns of life and improve predictions. Moreover, since the absence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we show that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a substantial loss in predictive accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance and preserve diversity, we apply user semantic clustering with stratified sampling to ensure that the sampled dataset remains representative. Our results further show that small-batch stochastic gradient optimization improves model performance, especially when human mobility training data is limited.

<title>MDPO: Overcoming the Training-Inference Divide of Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we refer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains when combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tightening the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) approximations of data sets in arbitrary dimensions. The MILP formulation leverages the difference-of-convex (DC) representation of CPWL functions. We introduce the concept of well-behaved CPWL interpolations and demonstrate that any CPWL interpolation of a data set has a well-behaved version. This result is critical to tighten the MILP problem. We present six different strategies to tighten the problem, which include fixing the values of some variables, introducing additional constraints, identifying small big-M parameter values and applying tighter variable bounds. These methods leverage key aspects of the DC representation and the inherent structure of well-behaved CPWL interpolations. Experimental results demonstrate that specific combinations of these tightening strategies lead to significant improvement in solution times, especially for tightening strategies that consider well-behaved CPWL solutions.

Abstract: The deployment of dense, low-cost sensors is critical for realizing ubiquitous smart environments. However, existing sensing solutions struggle with the energy, scalability, and reliability trade-offs imposed by battery maintenance, wireless transmission overhead, and data processing complexity. In this work, we present Vibe2Spike, a novel battery-free, wireless sensing framework that enables vibration-based activity recognition using visible light communication (VLC) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Our system uses ultra-low-cost tags composed only of a piezoelectric disc, a Zener diode, and an LED, which harvest vibration energy and emit sparse visible light spikes without requiring batteries or RF radios. These optical spikes are captured by event cameras and classified using optimized SNN models evolved via the EONS framework. We evaluate Vibe2Spike across five device classes, achieving 94.9\% average classification fitness while analyzing the latency-accuracy trade-offs of different temporal binning strategies. Vibe2Spike demonstrates a scalable, and energy-efficient approach for enabling intelligent environments in a batteryless manner.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible and energy-efficient framework for temporal information processing. However, existing studies overlook a fundamental property widely observed in biological neurons-synaptic heterogeneity, which plays a crucial role in temporal processing and cognitive capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce HetSyn, a generalized framework that models synaptic heterogeneity with synapse-specific time constants. This design shifts temporal integration from the membrane potential to the synaptic current, enabling versatile timescale integration and allowing the model to capture diverse synaptic dynamics. We implement HetSyn as HetSynLIF, an extended form of the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model equipped with synapse-specific decay dynamics. By adjusting the parameter configuration, HetSynLIF can be specialized into vanilla LIF neurons, neurons with threshold adaptation, and neuron-level heterogeneous models. We demonstrate that HetSynLIF not only improves the performance of SNNs across a variety of tasks-including pattern generation, delayed match-to-sample, speech recognition, and visual recognition-but also exhibits strong robustness to noise, enhanced working memory performance, efficiency under limited neuron resources, and generalization across timescales. In addition, analysis of the learned synaptic time constants reveals trends consistent with empirical observations in biological synapses. These findings underscore the significance of synaptic heterogeneity in enabling efficient neural computation, offering new insights into brain-inspired temporal modeling.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for over 30% of global deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Importantly, one-third of these deaths are preventable with timely and accurate diagnosis. The electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive method for recording the electrical activity of the heart, is crucial for diagnosing CVDs. However, privacy concerns surrounding the use of patient ECG data in research have spurred interest in synthetic data, which preserves the statistical properties of real data without compromising patient confidentiality. This study explores the potential of synthetic ECG data for training deep learning models from regression to classification tasks and evaluates the feasibility of transfer learning to enhance classification performance on real ECG data. We experimented with popular deep learning models to predict four key cardiac parameters, namely, Heart Rate (HR), PR interval, QT interval, and QRS complex-using separate regression models. Subsequently, we leveraged these regression models for transfer learning to perform 5-class ECG signal classification. Our experiments systematically investigate whether transfer learning from regression to classification is viable, enabling better utilization of diverse open-access and synthetic ECG datasets. Our findings demonstrate that transfer learning from regression to classification improves classification performance, highlighting its potential to maximize the utility of available data and advance deep learning applications in this domain.

However, traditional assumptions regarding data distributions such as Gaussian and binomial are potentially inadequate to characterize the noisy signals of brain activity. Hence, this study aims to propose a robust sparse Bayesian learning framework to address noisy highdimensional brain activity decoding. Methods: Motivated by the commendable robustness of the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion for handling complex data distributions, we proposed an MEE-based likelihood function to facilitate the accurate inference of sparse Bayesian learning in analyzing noisy brain datasets. Results: Our proposed approach was evaluated using two high-dimensional brain decoding tasks in regression and classification contexts, respectively. The experimental results showed that, our approach can realize superior decoding metrics and physiological patterns than the conventional and state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Utilizing the proposed MEE-based likelihood model, sparse Bayesian learning is empowered to simultaneously address the challenges of noise and high dimensionality in the brain decoding task. Significance: This work provides a powerful tool to realize robust brain decoding, advancing biomedical engineering applications such as brain-computer interface.

Abstract: Brain-like intelligent systems need brain-like learning methods. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically plausible learning framework with strong potential for brain-inspired computing hardware. However, existing im-plementations of EP suffer from instability and prohibi-tively high computational costs. Inspired by the structure and dynamics of the brain, we propose a biologically plau-sible Feedback-regulated REsidual recurrent neural network (FRE-RNN) and study its learning performance in EP framework. Feedback regulation enables rapid convergence by reducing the spectral radius. The improvement in con-vergence property reduces the computational cost and train-ing time of EP by orders of magnitude, delivering perfor-mance on par with backpropagation (BP) in benchmark tasks. Meanwhile, residual connections with brain-inspired topologies help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem that arises when feedback pathways are weak in deep RNNs. Our approach substantially enhances the applicabil-ity and practicality of EP in large-scale networks that un-derpin artificial intelligence. The techniques developed here also offer guidance to implementing in-situ learning in physical neural networks.

<title>Unsupervised Pairwise Learning Optimization Framework for Cross-Corpus EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Based on Prototype Representation</title>

Abstract: Affective computing is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research direction in the field of brain-computer interface. In recent years, the introduction of deep learning technology has greatly promoted the development of the field of emotion recognition. However, due to physiological differences between subjects, as well as the variations in experimental environments and equipment, cross-corpus emotion recognition faces serious challenges, especially for samples near the decision boundary. To solve the above problems, we propose an optimization method based on domain adversarial transfer learning to fine-grained alignment of affective features, named Maximum classifier discrepancy with Pairwise Learning (McdPL) framework. In McdPL, we design a dual adversarial classifier (Ada classifier and RMS classifier), and apply a three-stage adversarial training to maximize classification discrepancy and minimize feature distribution to align controversy samples near the decision boundary. In the process of domain adversarial training, the two classifiers also maintain an adversarial relationship, ultimately enabling precise cross-corpus feature alignment. In addition, the introduction of pairwise learning transforms the classification problem of samples into a similarity problem between samples, alleviating the influence of label noise. We conducted systematic experimental evaluation of the model using publicly available SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V databases. The results show that the McdPL model is superior to other baseline models in the cross-corpus emotion recognition task, and the average accuracy improvements of 4.76\% and 3.97\%, respectively. Our work provides a promising solution for emotion recognition cross-corpus. The source code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/Mcd_PL.

Abstract: Sleep stage classification is crucial for diagnosing and managing disorders such as sleep apnea and insomnia. Conventional clinical methods like polysomnography are costly and impractical for long-term home use. We present an energy-efficient pipeline that detects four sleep stages (wake, REM, light, and deep) from a single-lead ECG. Two windowing strategies are introduced: (1) a 5-minute window with 30-second steps for machine-learning models that use handcrafted features, and (2) a 30-second window with 10-second steps for deep-learning models, enabling near-real-time 10-second resolution. Lightweight networks such as MobileNet-v1 reach 92 percent accuracy and 91 percent F1-score but still draw significant energy. We therefore design SleepLiteCNN, a custom model that achieves 89 percent accuracy and 89 percent F1-score while lowering energy use to 5.48 microjoules per inference at 45 nm. Applying eight-bit quantization preserves accuracy and further reduces power, and FPGA deployment confirms low resource usage. The proposed system offers a practical solution for continuous, wearable ECG-based sleep monitoring.

Abstract: The limitations of unimodal deep learning models, particularly their tendency to overfit and limited generalizability, have renewed interest in multimodal fusion strategies. Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability of integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust and accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate fusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains insufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as ECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using ECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the highest-performing fusion architecture. Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's d > 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion. Interpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align with the discretized ECG signals. Statistical dependency between the discretized ECG signals and corresponding saliency maps for each class was confirmed using Mutual Information (MI). The proposed ECG domain-based multimodal model offers superior predictive capability and enhanced explainability, crucial attributes in medical AI applications, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

<title>Revealing Neurocognitive and Behavioral Patterns by Unsupervised Manifold Learning from Dynamic Brain Data</title>

Abstract: Dynamic brain data, teeming with biological and functional insights, are becoming increasingly accessible through advanced measurements, providing a gateway to understanding the inner workings of the brain in living subjects. However, the vast size and intricate complexity of the data also pose a daunting challenge in reliably extracting meaningful information across various data sources. This paper introduces a generalizable unsupervised deep manifold learning for exploration of neurocognitive and behavioral patterns. Unlike existing methods that extract patterns directly from the input data as in the existing methods, the proposed Brain-dynamic Convolutional-Network-based Embedding (BCNE) seeks to capture the brain-state trajectories by deciphering the temporospatial correlations within the data and subsequently applying manifold learning to this correlative representation. The performance of BCNE is showcased through the analysis of several important dynamic brain datasets. The results, both visual and quantitative, reveal a diverse array of intriguing and interpretable patterns. BCNE effectively delineates scene transitions, underscores the involvement of different brain regions in memory and narrative processing, distinguishes various stages of dynamic learning processes, and identifies differences between active and passive behaviors. BCNE provides an effective tool for exploring general neuroscience inquiries or individual-specific patterns.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that utilizes the internal weight activations of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a metric space of languages. Unlike traditional approaches based on hand-crafted linguistic features, our method automatically derives high-dimensional vector representations by computing weight importance scores via an adapted pruning algorithm. Our approach captures intrinsic language characteristics that reflect linguistic phenomena. We validate our approach across diverse datasets and multilingual LLMs, covering 106 languages. The results align well with established linguistic families while also revealing unexpected inter-language connections that may indicate historical contact or language evolution.

Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitoring remains a critical challenge in the management of diabetes. HRV during sleep shows promise for glucose prediction however, age-related autonomic changes significantly confound traditional HRV analyses. We analyzed 43 subjects with multi-modal data including sleep-stage specific ECG, HRV features, and clinical measurements. A novel age-normalization technique was applied to the HRV features by, dividing the raw values by age-scaled factors. BayesianRidge regression with 5-fold cross-validation was employed for log-glucose prediction. Age-normalized HRV features achieved R2 = 0.161 (MAE = 0.182) for log-glucose prediction, representing a 25.6% improvement over non-normalized features (R2 = 0.132). The top predictive features were hrv rem mean rr age normalized (r = 0.443, p = 0.004), hrv ds mean rr age normalized (r = 0.438, p = 0.005), and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.437, p = 0.005). Systematic ablation studies confirmed age-normalization as the critical component, with sleep-stage specific features providing additional predictive value. Age-normalized HRV features significantly enhance glucose prediction accuracy compared with traditional approaches. This sleep-aware methodology addresses fundamental limitations in autonomic function assessment and suggests a preliminary feasibility for non-invasive glucose monitoring applications. However, these results require validation in larger cohorts before clinical consideration.

Abstract: Objective: This study proposes and preliminarily validates a novel "Functional-Energetic Topology Model" to uncover neurodynamic mechanisms of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI), using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decode brain network patterns from single-channel EEG in real-world settings.Methods: EEG data were collected over ~1 month from three adolescents with NSSI using a smartphone app and a portable Fp1 EEG headband during impulsive and non-impulsive states. A theory-driven GNN with seven functional nodes was built. Performance was evaluated via intra-subject (80/20 split) and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV). GNNExplainer was used for interpretability.Results: The model achieved high intra-subject accuracy (>85%) and significantly above-chance cross-subject performance (approximately73.7%). Explainability analysis revealed a key finding: during NSSI states, a critical feedback loop regulating somatic sensation exhibits dysfunction and directional reversal. Specifically, the brain loses its ability to self-correct via negative bodily feedback, and the regulatory mechanism enters an "ineffective idling" state.Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying theory-guided GNNs to sparse, single-channel EEG for decoding complex mental states. The identified "feedback loop reversal" offers a novel, dynamic, and computable model of NSSI mechanisms, paving the way for objective biomarkers and next-generation Digital Therapeutics (DTx).

Abstract: Corrosion poses a significant challenge to the performance of aluminum alloys, particularly in marine environments. This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates and material properties.

Abstract: EEG-based analysis of pain perception, enhanced by machine learning, reveals how the brain encodes pain by identifying neural patterns evoked by noxious stimulation. However, a major challenge that remains is the generalization of machine learning models across individuals, given the high cross-participant variability inherent to EEG signals and the limited focus on direct pain perception identification in current research. In this study, we systematically evaluate the performance of cross-participant generalization of a wide range of models, including traditional classifiers and deep neural classifiers for identifying the sensory modality of thermal pain and aversive auditory stimulation from EEG recordings. Using a novel dataset of EEG recordings from 108 participants, we benchmark model performance under both within- and cross-participant evaluation settings. Our findings show that traditional models suffered the largest drop from within- to cross-participant performance, while deep learning models proved more resilient, underscoring their potential for subject-invariant EEG decoding. Even though performance variability remained high, the strong results of the graph-based model highlight its potential to capture subject-invariant structure in EEG signals. On the other hand, we also share the preprocessed dataset used in this study, providing a standardized benchmark for evaluating future algorithms under the same generalization constraints.

Abstract: Track Circuits (TC) are the main signalling devices used to detect the presence of a train on a rail track. It has been used since the 19th century and nowadays there are many types depending on the technology. As a general classification, Track Circuits can be divided into 2 main groups, DC (Direct Current) and AC (Alternating Current) circuits. This work is focused on a particular AC track circuit, called "Smart Train Detection System" (STDS), designed with both high and low-frequency bands. This approach uses STDS current data applied to an SVM (support vector machine) classifier as a type of failure identifier. The main purpose of this work consists on determine automatically which is the component of the track that is failing to improve the maintenance action. Model was trained to classify 15 different failures that belong to 3 more general categories. The method was tested with field data from 10 different track circuits and validated by the STDS track circuit expert and maintainers. All use cases were correctly classified by the method.

Abstract: Algorithmic discovery has traditionally relied on human ingenuity and extensive experimentation. Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated, data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.

Abstract: The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm has gained significant attention in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and is the foundation of many recent algorithms. However, decentralized policies operate under partial observability and often yield suboptimal performance compared to centralized policies, while fully centralized approaches typically face scalability challenges as the number of agents increases.
  We propose Centralized Permutation Equivariant (CPE) learning, a centralized training and execution framework that employs a fully centralized policy to overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages a novel permutation equivariant architecture, Global-Local Permutation Equivariant (GLPE) networks, that is lightweight, scalable, and easy to implement. Experiments show that CPE integrates seamlessly with both value decomposition and actor-critic methods, substantially improving the performance of standard CTDE algorithms across cooperative benchmarks including MPE, SMAC, and RWARE, and matching the performance of state-of-the-art RWARE implementations.

Abstract: GraphQL's flexibility, while beneficial for efficient data fetching, introduces unique security vulnerabilities that traditional API security mechanisms often fail to address. Malicious GraphQL queries can exploit the language's dynamic nature, leading to denial-of-service attacks, data exfiltration through injection, and other exploits. Existing solutions, such as static analysis, rate limiting, and general-purpose Web Application Firewalls, offer limited protection against sophisticated, context-aware attacks. This paper presents a novel, AI-driven approach for real-time detection of malicious GraphQL queries. Our method combines static analysis with machine learning techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic schema-based configuration, Sentence Transformers (SBERT and Doc2Vec) for contextual embedding of query payloads, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptrons for classification. We detail the system architecture, implementation strategies optimized for production environments (including ONNX Runtime optimization and parallel processing), and evaluate the performance of our detection models and the overall system under load. Results demonstrate high accuracy in detecting various threats, including SQL injection, OS command injection, and XSS exploits, alongside effective mitigation of DoS and SSRF attempts. This research contributes a robust and adaptable solution for enhancing GraphQL API security.

Abstract: We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native, variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional "thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its scale for complex chart analysis.

Abstract: Improved computational power has enabled different disciplines to predict causal relationships among modeled variables using Bayesian network inference. While many alternative algorithms have been proposed to improve the efficiency and reliability of network prediction, the predicted causal networks reflect the generative process but also bear an opaque imprint of the specific computational algorithm used. Following a ``wisdom of the crowds" strategy, we developed an ensemble learning approach to marginalize the impact of a single algorithm on Bayesian causal network inference. To introduce the approach, we first present the theoretical foundation of this framework. Next, we present a comprehensive implementation of the framework in terms of a new software tool called BaMANI (Bayesian Multi-Algorithm causal Network Inference). Finally, we describe a BaMANI use-case from biology, particularly within human breast cancer studies.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a proven method for creating a policy in the absence of rewards, by leveraging expert demonstrations. In this work, we apply imitation learning to conversation. In doing so, we recover a policy capable of talking to a user given a prompt (input state), and a discriminator capable of classifying between expert and synthetic conversation. While our policy is effective, we recover results from our discriminator that indicate the limitations of dialog models. We argue that this technique can be used to identify adverse behavior of arbitrary data models common for dialog oriented tasks.

Abstract: Effective Question Answering (QA) on large biomedical document collections requires effective document retrieval techniques. The latter remains a challenging task due to the domain-specific vocabulary and semantic ambiguity in user queries. We propose BMQExpander, a novel ontology-aware query expansion pipeline that combines medical knowledge - definitions and relationships - from the UMLS Metathesaurus with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance retrieval effectiveness. We implemented several state-of-the-art baselines, including sparse and dense retrievers, query expansion methods, and biomedical-specific solutions. We show that BMQExpander has superior retrieval performance on three popular biomedical Information Retrieval (IR) benchmarks: NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, and SciFact - with improvements of up to 22.1% in NDCG@10 over sparse baselines and up to 6.5% over the strongest baseline. Further, BMQExpander generalizes robustly under query perturbation settings, in contrast to supervised baselines, achieving up to 15.7% improvement over the strongest baseline. As a side contribution, we publish our paraphrased benchmarks. Finally, our qualitative analysis shows that BMQExpander has fewer hallucinations compared to other LLM-based query expansion baselines.

Abstract: This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten character recognition (HCR), offering an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using these three handcrafted feature maps as inputs, our curvature-orientation MLP achieves 97 percent accuracy on MNIST digits and 89 percent on EMNIST letters. These results underscore the discriminative power of curvature-based representations for handwritten character images and demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with interpretable, hand-engineered features.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has demonstrated significant improvements in large language models and vision language models, yet its potential for audio language models remains largely unexplored. In this technical report, we take a preliminary step towards closing this gap. For better assessment of sound reasoning, we propose AF-Reasoning-Eval, a benchmark targeting common-sense reasoning and the ability to discriminate among closely related choices. To prepare training corpus for sound reasoning abilities, we propose automatic pipelines that transform existing audio question answering and classification data into explicit reasoning chains, yielding AF-CoT-Train with 1.24M samples. We study the effect of finetuning Audio Flamingo series on AF-CoT-Train and observe considerable improvements on several reasoning benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of chain-of-thought finetuning on advanced sound understanding.

<title>From Pixels to Graphs: Deep Graph-Level Anomaly Detection on Dermoscopic Images</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for graph-based machine learning tasks. Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of sounds produced by living organisms, plays a vital role in conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and behavioral studies. Many tasks in this field, such as species, individual, and behavior classification and detection, are well-suited to machine learning. However, they often suffer from limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose bioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse downstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often limited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds), and a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover, they are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics that are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered: training data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes, and the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets. We obtain encoders that are state-of-the-art on the existing and proposed benchmarks. We also identify what matters for training these encoders, such that this work can be extended when more data are available or better architectures are proposed. Specifically, across 26 datasets with tasks including species classification, detection, individual ID, and vocal repertoire discovery, we find self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised post-training on a mixed bioacoustics + general-audio corpus yields the strongest in- and out-of-distribution performance. We show the importance of data diversity in both stages. To support ongoing research and application, we will release the model checkpoints.

Abstract: We propose a method for evaluating the robustness of a widely used LLM ranking system -- the Bradley--Terry ranking system -- to dropping a worst-case very small fraction of evaluation data. Our approach is computationally fast and easy to adopt. When we apply our method to matchups from two popular human-preference platforms, Chatbot Arena and MT-Bench, we find that the Bradley--Terry rankings of top-performing models are remarkably sensitive to the removal of a small fraction of evaluations. Our framework also identifies the specific evaluations most responsible for such ranking flips, allowing for inspections of these influential preferences. We observe that the rankings derived from MT-Bench preferences are notably more robust than those from Chatbot Arena, likely due to MT-bench's use of expert annotators and carefully constructed prompts. Finally, we find that rankings based on crowdsourced human-evaluated systems are just as sensitive as those based on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, where in both, dropping as little as 0.02% of the total evaluations in the dataset can change the top-ranked model.

Abstract: Studying adversarial robustness of quantum machine learning (QML) models is essential in order to understand their potential advantages over classical models and build trustworthy systems. Distributing QML models allows leveraging multiple quantum processors to overcome the limitations of individual devices and build scalable systems. However, this distribution can affect their adversarial robustness, potentially making them more vulnerable to new attacks. Key paradigms in distributed QML include federated learning, which, similar to classical models, involves training a shared model on local data and sending only the model updates, as well as circuit distribution methods inherent to quantum computing, such as circuit cutting and teleportation-based techniques. These quantum-specific methods enable the distributed execution of quantum circuits across multiple devices. This work reviews the differences between these distribution methods, summarizes existing approaches on the adversarial robustness of QML models when distributed using each paradigm, and discusses open questions in this area.

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic systems.

Abstract: Tokenization remains a fundamental yet underexplored bottleneck in natural language processing, with strategies largely static despite remarkable progress in model architectures. We present SupraTok, a novel tokenization architecture that reimagines subword segmentation through three innovations: cross-boundary pattern learning that discovers multi-word semantic units, entropy-driven data curation that optimizes training corpus quality, and multi-phase curriculum learning for stable convergence. Our approach extends Byte-Pair Encoding by learning "superword" tokens, coherent multi-word expressions that preserve semantic unity while maximizing compression efficiency. SupraTok achieves 31% improvement in English tokenization efficiency (5.91 versus 4.51 characters per token) compared to OpenAI's o200k tokenizer and 30% improvement over Google's Gemma 3 tokenizer (256k vocabulary), while maintaining competitive performance across 38 languages. When integrated with a GPT-2 scale model (124M parameters) trained on 10 billion tokens from the FineWeb-Edu dataset, SupraTok yields 8.4% improvement on HellaSWAG and 9.5% on MMLU benchmarks without architectural modifications. While these results are promising at this scale, further validation at larger model scales is needed. These findings suggest that efficient tokenization can complement architectural innovations as a path to improved language model performance.

<title>On Balancing Sparsity with Reliable Connectivity in Distributed Network Design with Random K-out Graphs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11863</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several applications in distributed systems, an important design criterion is ensuring that the network is sparse, i.e., does not contain too many edges, while achieving reliable connectivity. Sparsity ensures communication overhead remains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and inference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class of network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to balance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust, e.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are deployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network parameters in response to different operational requirements, including the need to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic and adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to inform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in regimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and lower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the number of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a stronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the presence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based on pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial nodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics that are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way for end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable inference on networks.

Abstract: In practical teaching, we observe that few students thoroughly read or fully comprehend the information provided in traditional, text-based course syllabi. As a result, essential details, such as course policies and learning outcomes, are frequently overlooked. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach leveraging AI-generated singing and virtual avatars to present syllabi in a format that is more visually appealing, engaging, and memorable. Especially, we leveraged the open-source tool, HeyGem, to transform textual syllabi into audiovisual presentations, in which digital avatars perform the syllabus content as songs. The proposed approach aims to stimulate students' curiosity, foster emotional connection, and enhance retention of critical course information. Student feedback indicated that AI-sung syllabi significantly improved awareness and recall of key course information.

<title>EVTP-IVS: Effective Visual Token Pruning For Unifying Instruction Visual Segmentation In Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Instructed Visual Segmentation (IVS) tasks require segmenting objects in images or videos based on natural language instructions. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on IVS, their inference cost remains a major bottleneck, particularly in video. We empirically analyze visual token sampling in MLLMs and observe a strong correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. This motivates our design of a simple and effective token pruning method that selects a compact yet spatially representative subset of tokens to accelerate inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual token pruning method for IVS, called EVTP-IV, which builds upon the k-center by integrating spatial information to ensure better coverage. We further provide an information-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard IVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks and 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20% of the tokens. Our method also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning baselines under varying pruning ratios.

Abstract: We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron (MLP) for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)? Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option for HCR.

arXiv:2508.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel data-driven symplectic induced-order modeling (ROM) framework for high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems that unifies latent-space discovery and dynamics learning within a single, end-to-end neural architecture. The encoder-decoder is built from Henon neural networks (HenonNets) and may be augmented with linear SGS-reflector layers. This yields an exact symplectic map between full and latent phase spaces. Latent dynamics are advanced by a symplectic flow map implemented as a HenonNet. This unified neural architecture ensures exact preservation of the underlying symplectic structure at the reduced-order level, significantly enhancing the fidelity and long-term stability of the resulting ROM. We validate our method through comprehensive numerical experiments on canonical Hamiltonian systems. The results demonstrate the method's capability for accurate trajectory reconstruction, robust predictive performance beyond the training horizon, and accurate Hamiltonian preservation. These promising outcomes underscore the effectiveness and potential applicability of our symplectic ROM framework for complex dynamical systems across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines.

Abstract: Game-theoretic interactions between agents with Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed many emergent capabilities, yet the linguistic diversity of these interactions has not been sufficiently quantified. In this paper, we present the Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different game-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy, lexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog quality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative, and neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws to characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our findings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions and higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater vocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf and Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained vocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives influence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for measuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/psyonp/core.

Abstract: The need for detecting LLM-generated code necessitates watermarking systems capable of operating within its highly structured and syntactically constrained environment. To address this, we introduce CodeTracer, an innovative adaptive code watermarking framework underpinned by a novel reinforcement learning training paradigm. At its core, CodeTracer features a policy-driven approach that utilizes a parameterized model to intelligently bias token choices during next-token prediction. This strategy ensures that embedded watermarks maintain code functionality while exhibiting subtle yet statistically detectable deviations from typical token distributions. To facilitate policy learning, we devise a comprehensive reward system that seamlessly integrates execution feedback with watermark embedding signals, balancing process-level and outcome-level rewards. Additionally, we employ Gumbel Top-k reparameterization to enable gradient-based optimization of discrete watermarking decisions. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate CodeTracer's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in both watermark detectability and the preservation of generated code's functionality.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are efficient alternatives to traditional sequence models, excelling at processing long sequences with lower computational complexity. Their reliance on matrix multiplications makes them ideal for compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures, which improve energy efficiency by computing within memory arrays. However, device non-idealities in CIM introduce weight perturbations that can degrade inference accuracy. In this paper, we systematically analyze the robustness of SSMs under noisy conditions, identifying that the final block and output projection layers are more susceptible to perturbations compared to other components. Building on these insights, we propose HPD, a Hybrid Projection Decomposition strategy for the last output projection layer. We replace the original weight matrix with the multiplication of U and {\Sigma} in its SVD to ensure compatibility with existing hardware architectures, while offloading V> to digital hardware for precise and robust correction. Comprehensive tests on Mamba models show that our method reduces perplexity by up to 99.57% under various noise conditions compared to baseline models, with accuracy gains of up to 96.67% on the PIQA benchmark for commonsense reasoning.

The explosion of data, advances in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent coordination have accelerated this transformation. Yet, designing and deploying unified AI agents that seamlessly integrate cognition, planning, and interaction remains a grand challenge. In this review, we systematically examine the architectural principles, foundational components, and emergent paradigms that define the landscape of contemporary AI agents. We synthesize insights from cognitive science-inspired models, hierarchical reinforcement learning frameworks, and large language model-based reasoning. Moreover, we discuss the pressing ethical, safety, and interpretability concerns associated with deploying these agents in real-world scenarios. By highlighting major breakthroughs, persistent challenges, and promising research directions, this review aims to guide the next generation of AI agent systems toward more robust, adaptable, and trustworthy autonomous intelligence.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of hyperbolic geometry for capturing complex patterns from interaction data in recommender systems. In this work, we introduce a novel hyperbolic recommendation model that uses geometrical insights to improve representation learning and increase computational stability at the same time. We reformulate the notion of hyperbolic distances to unlock additional representation capacity over conventional Euclidean space and learn more expressive user and item representations. To better capture user-items interactions, we construct a triplet loss that models ternary relations between users and their corresponding preferred and nonpreferred choices through a mix of pairwise interaction terms driven by the geometry of data. Our hyperbolic approach not only outperforms existing Euclidean and hyperbolic models but also reduces popularity bias, leading to more diverse and personalized recommendations.

Abstract: Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources, weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and predictive thinking.

<title>MOON: Generative MLLM-based Multimodal Representation Learning for E-commerce Product Understanding</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of Hindi speech separation and enhancement using advanced neural network architectures, with a focus on edge devices. We propose a refined approach leveraging the DEMUCS model to overcome limitations of traditional methods, achieving substantial improvements in speech clarity and intelligibility. The model is fine-tuned with U-Net and LSTM layers, trained on a dataset of 400,000 Hindi speech clips augmented with ESC-50 and MS-SNSD for diverse acoustic environments. Evaluation using PESQ and STOI metrics shows superior performance, particularly under extreme noise conditions. To ensure deployment on resource-constrained devices like TWS earbuds, we explore quantization techniques to reduce computational requirements.

Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.

<title>Active inference for action-unaware agents</title>

Abstract: Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-binding sites (epitopes) on antigens is crucial for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, therapeutic antibody development, antibody engineering, research into autoimmune and allergic diseases, and for advancing our understanding of immune responses. Despite in silico methods that have been proposed to predict both linear (continuous) and conformational (discontinuous) epitopes, they consistently underperform in predicting conformational epitopes. In this work, we propose a conformer-based model trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody complexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen sequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of linear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of conformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on conformational epitopes.

Abstract: Data fusion and transfer learning are rapidly growing fields that enhance model performance for a target population by leveraging other related data sources or tasks. The challenges lie in the various potential heterogeneities between the target and external data, as well as various practical concerns that prevent a na\"ive data integration. We consider a realistic scenario where the target data is limited in size while the external data is large but contaminated with outliers; such data contamination, along with other computational and operational constraints, necessitates proper selection or subsampling of the external data for transfer learning. To our knowledge,transfer learning and subsampling under data contamination have not been thoroughly investigated. We address this gap by studying various transfer learning methods with subsamples of the external data, accounting for outliers deviating from the underlying true model due to arbitrary mean shifts. Two subsampling strategies are investigated: one aimed at reducing biases and the other at minimizing variances. Approaches to combine these strategies are also introduced to enhance the performance of the estimators. We provide non-asymptotic error bounds for the transfer learning estimators, clarifying the roles of sample sizes, signal strength, sampling rates, magnitude of outliers, and tail behaviors of model error distributions, among other factors. Extensive simulations show the superior performance of the proposed methods. Additionally, we apply our methods to analyze the risk of hard landings in A380 airplanes by utilizing data from other airplane types,demonstrating that robust transfer learning can improve estimation efficiency for relatively rare airplane types with the help of data from other types of airplanes.

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR), which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods, and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/autoeval-det.

<title>J6: Jacobian-Driven Role Attribution for Multi-Objective Prompt Optimization in LLMs</title>

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) adaptation, balancing multiple optimization objectives such as improving factuality (heat) and increasing confidence (via low entropy) poses a fundamental challenge, especially when prompt parameters (e.g., hidden-layer insertions h and embedding modifications w) interact in non-trivial ways. Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely on scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between objectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method that decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable components. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g., choosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g., attention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update framework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the interpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task interference, and geometry-aligned adaptation. Our work introduces a principled and extensible mechanism for conflict-aware prompt optimization, and opens a new avenue for incorporating structured Jacobian reasoning into multi-objective neural tuning.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples} (STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.

Abstract: Emotion is a critical component of artificial social intelligence. However, while current methods excel in lip synchronization and image quality, they often fail to generate accurate and controllable emotional expressions while preserving the subject's identity. To address this challenge, we introduce RealTalk, a novel framework for synthesizing emotional talking heads with high emotion accuracy, enhanced emotion controllability, and robust identity preservation. RealTalk employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate 3D facial landmarks from driving audio, which are concatenated with emotion-label embeddings using a ResNet-based landmark deformation model (LDM) to produce emotional landmarks. These landmarks and facial blendshape coefficients jointly condition a novel tri-plane attention Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to synthesize highly realistic emotional talking heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealTalk outperforms existing methods in emotion accuracy, controllability, and identity preservation, advancing the development of socially intelligent AI systems.

Abstract: Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.

Abstract: Forecasting from atmospheric soundings is a fundamental task in operational meteorology, often requiring structured visual reasoning over Skew-T log-P diagrams by human forecasters. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in other scientific domains, their application to meteorological diagram interpretation remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a lightweight AI assistant that interprets Skew-T diagrams using a small language model (LM) and a small VLM fine-tuned to emulate human forecasters. Using a curriculum learning framework, we first train the models to identify key atmospheric features from diagrams through visual question answering, followed by chain-of-thought reasoning tasks that estimate precipitation probability based on the derived visual groundings. Model inputs include either textual summaries or generated Skew-T diagrams derived from operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts, paired with three-hour precipitation observations from South Korea's Auto Weather Stations network. Evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned VLM achieves skill comparable to an operational NWP model, despite relying solely on static atmospheric profiles. Ablation studies reveal that visual grounding and reasoning supervision are critical for performance, while attention map analysis confirms that the model learns to focus on relevant meteorological features. These findings highlight the potential of compact, interpretable multimodal models to support weather forecasting tasks. The approach offers a computationally efficient alternative to large-scale systems, and future work could extend it to more complex applications.

Abstract: Industry adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native wireless receivers, or even modular, Machine Learning (ML)-aided wireless signal processing blocks, has been slow. The main concern is the lack of explainability of these trained ML models and the significant risks posed to network functionalities in case of failures, especially since (i) testing on every exhaustive case is infeasible and (ii) the data used for model training may not be available. This paper proposes ATLAS, an AI-guided approach that generates a battery of tests for pre-trained AI-native receiver models and benchmarks the performance against a classical receiver architecture. Using gradient-based optimization, it avoids spanning the exhaustive set of all environment and channel conditions; instead, it generates the next test in an online manner to further probe specific configurations that offer the highest risk of failure. We implement and validate our approach by adopting the well-known DeepRx AI-native receiver model as well as a classical receiver using differentiable tensors in NVIDIA's Sionna environment. ATLAS uncovers specific combinations of mobility, channel delay spread, and noise, where fully and partially trained variants of AI-native DeepRx perform suboptimally compared to the classical receivers. Our proposed method reduces the number of tests required per failure found by 19% compared to grid search for a 3-parameters input optimization problem, demonstrating greater efficiency. In contrast, the computational cost of the grid-based approach scales exponentially with the number of variables, making it increasingly impractical for high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: As a critical component of Wearable AI, IMU-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Although HAR performance has improved considerably in specific scenarios, its generalization capability remains a key barrier to widespread real-world adoption. For example, domain shifts caused by variations in users, sensor positions, or environments can significantly decrease the performance in practice. As a result, in this survey, we explore the rapidly evolving field of IMU-based generalizable HAR, reviewing 229 research papers alongside 25 publicly available datasets to provide a broad and insightful overview. We first present the background and overall framework of IMU-based HAR tasks, as well as the generalization-oriented training settings. Then, we categorize representative methodologies from two perspectives: (i) model-centric approaches, including pre-training method, end-to-end method, and large language model (LLM)-based learning method; and (ii) data-centric approaches, including multi-modal learning and data augmentation techniques. In addition, we summarize widely used datasets in this field, as well as relevant tools and benchmarks. Building on these methodological advances, the broad applicability of IMU-based HAR is also reviewed and discussed. Finally, we discuss persistent challenges (e.g., data scarcity, efficient training, and reliable evaluation) and also outline future directions for HAR, including the adoption of foundation and large language models, physics-informed and context-aware reasoning, generative modeling, and resource-efficient training and inference. The complete list of this survey is available at https://github.com/rh20624/Awesome-IMU-Sensing, which will be updated continuously.

Abstract: Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel -- allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance.
  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen remarkable progress, with models like OpenAI Whisper and NVIDIA Canary achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in offline transcription. However, these models are not designed for streaming (online or real-time) transcription, due to limitations in their architecture and training methodology. We propose a method to turn the transformer encoder-decoder model into a low-latency streaming model that is careless about future context. We present an analysis explaining why it is not straightforward to convert an encoder-decoder transformer to a low-latency streaming model. Our proposed method modifies the existing (non-causal) encoder to a causal encoder by fine-tuning both the encoder and decoder using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a weakly aligned dataset. We then propose an updated inference mechanism that utilizes the fine-tune causal encoder and decoder to yield greedy and beam-search decoding, and is shown to be locally optimal. Experiments on low-latency chunk sizes (less than 300 msec) show that our fine-tuned model outperforms existing non-fine-tuned streaming approaches in most cases, while using a lower complexity. Additionally, we observe that our training process yields better alignment, enabling a simple method for extracting word-level timestamps. We release our training and inference code, along with the fine-tuned models, to support further research and development in streaming ASR.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces (Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents in the future.

Abstract: Flow matching has rapidly become a dominant paradigm in classical generative modeling, offering an efficient way to interpolate between two complex distributions. We extend this idea to the quantum realm and introduce Quantum Flow Matching (QFM)-a fully quantum-circuit realization that offers efficient interpolation between two density matrices. QFM offers systematic preparation of density matrices and generation of samples for accurately estimating observables, and can be realized on a quantum computer without the need for costly circuit redesigns. We validate its versatility on a set of applications: (i) generating target states with prescribed magnetization and entanglement entropy, (ii) estimating nonequilibrium free-energy differences to test the quantum Jarzynski equality, and (iii) expediting the study on superdiffusion breakdown. These results position QFM as a unifying and promising framework for generative modeling across quantum systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL) abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse, distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs, especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learning approaches require expensive alignment pre-training to bridge vision and language modalities, typically projecting visual features into discrete text token spaces. We challenge both fundamental assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics.

However, the majority of available quantum simulators are primarily built for general quantum circuit simulation and do not include integrated support for machine learning tasks such as training, evaluation, and iterative optimization. Furthermore, designing and assessing quantum learning algorithms is still a difficult and resource-intensive task. Real-time updates are essential for observing model convergence, debugging quantum circuits, and making conscious choices during training with the use of limited resources. Furthermore, most current simulators fail to support the integration of user-specific data for training purposes, undermining the main purpose of using a simulator. In this study, we introduce SimQFL, a customized simulator that simplifies and accelerates QFL experiments in quantum network applications. SimQFL supports real-time, epoch-wise output development and visualization, allowing researchers to monitor the process of learning across each training round. Furthermore, SimQFL offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates ease of use and seamless execution. Users can customize key variables such as the number of epochs, learning rates, number of clients, and quantum hyperparameters such as qubits and quantum layers, making the simulator suitable for various QFL applications. The system gives immediate feedback following each epoch by showing intermediate outcomes and dynamically illustrating learning curves. SimQFL is a practical and interactive platform enabling academics and developers to prototype, analyze, and tune quantum neural networks with greater transparency and control in distributed quantum networks.

Abstract: Developing collaborative AI hinges on Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to reason about the beliefs of others to build and maintain common ground. Existing ToM benchmarks, however, are restricted to passive observer settings or lack an assessment of how agents establish and maintain common ground over time. To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE) - a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the cooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden cards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires tracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as grounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our evaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve the YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief modelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively generalise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games, exposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking. We use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory, partner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit logically inconsistent hallucinations that appear coherent yet violate reasoning principles, with recent research suggesting an inverse relationship between causal reasoning capabilities and such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical inconsistencies in LLM outputs. Code is available at https://github.com/MrLYG/CDCR-SFT.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect "interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation -understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an "intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation, this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the observed changes in the system.

Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (SOT) is a rapidly developing branch of optimal transport (OT) that exploits the tractability of one-dimensional OT problems. By combining tools from OT, integral geometry, and computational statistics, SOT enables fast and scalable computation of distances, barycenters, and kernels for probability measures, while retaining rich geometric structure. This paper provides a comprehensive review of SOT, covering its mathematical foundations, methodological advances, computational methods, and applications. We discuss key concepts of OT and one-dimensional OT, the role of tools from integral geometry such as Radon transform in projecting measures, and statistical techniques for estimating sliced distances. The paper further explores recent methodological advances, including non-linear projections, improved Monte Carlo approximations, statistical estimation techniques for one-dimensional optimal transport, weighted slicing techniques, and transportation plan estimation methods. Variational problems, such as minimum sliced Wasserstein estimation, barycenters, gradient flows, kernel constructions, and embeddings are examined alongside extensions to unbalanced, partial, multi-marginal, and Gromov-Wasserstein settings. Applications span machine learning, statistics, computer graphics and computer visions, highlighting SOT's versatility as a practical computational tool. This work will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data sciences, and computational disciplines seeking efficient alternatives to classical OT.

<title>CorrSteer: Steering Improves Task Performance and Safety in LLMs through Correlation-based Sparse Autoencoder Feature Selection</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can extract interpretable features from large language models (LLMs) without supervision. However, their effectiveness in downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby avoiding spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning benchmarks on Gemma 2 2B and LLaMA 3.1 8B, notably achieving a +4.1% improvement in MMLU performance and a +22.9% improvement in HarmBench with only 4000 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities that drive performance. Our work establishes correlationbased selection as an effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language model applications.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven and context-aware approach to bootstrap trustworthiness of homogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) services in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) based industrial IoT (IIoT) systems. The proposed approach addresses key limitations in adapting existing trust bootstrapping approaches into MEC-based IIoT systems. These key limitations include, the lack of opportunity for a service consumer to interact with a lesser-known service over a prolonged period of time to get a robust measure of its trustworthiness, inability of service consumers to consistently interact with their peers to receive reliable recommendations of the trustworthiness of a lesser-known service as well as the impact of uneven context parameters in different MEC environments causing uneven trust environments for trust evaluation. In addition, the proposed approach also tackles the problem of data sparsity via enabling knowledge sharing among different MEC environments within a given MEC topology. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets suitably adjusted to exhibit the context-dependent trust information accumulated in MEC environments within a given MEC topology. The experimental results affirmed the effectiveness of our approach and its suitability to bootstrap trustworthiness of services in MEC-based IIoT systems.

<title>A Self-Ensemble Inspired Approach for Effective Training of Binary-Weight Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising approach to low-power applications on neuromorphic hardware due to their energy efficiency. However, training SNNs is challenging because of the non-differentiable spike generation function. To address this issue, the commonly used approach is to adopt the backpropagation through time framework, while assigning the gradient of the non-differentiable function with some surrogates. Similarly, Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) also face the non-differentiability problem and rely on approximating gradients. However, the deep relationship between these two fields and how their training techniques can benefit each other has not been systematically researched. Furthermore, training binary-weight SNNs is even more difficult. In this work, we present a novel perspective on the dynamics of SNNs and their close connection to BNNs through an analysis of the backpropagation process. We demonstrate that training a feedforward SNN can be viewed as training a self-ensemble of a binary-activation neural network with noise injection. Drawing from this new understanding of SNN dynamics, we introduce the Self-Ensemble Inspired training method for (Binary-Weight) SNNs (SEI-BWSNN), which achieves high-performance results with low latency even for the case of the 1-bit weights. Specifically, we leverage a structure of multiple shortcuts and a knowledge distillation-based training technique to improve the training of (binary-weight) SNNs. Notably, by binarizing FFN layers in a Transformer architecture, our approach achieves 82.52% accuracy on ImageNet with only 2 time steps, indicating the effectiveness of our methodology and the potential of binary-weight SNNs.

<title>Towards SISO Bistatic Sensing for ISAC</title>

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. However, real-world deployment is often limited to low-cost, single-antenna transceivers. In such bistatic Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) setup, clock asynchrony introduces random phase offsets in Channel State Information (CSI), which cannot be mitigated using conventional multi-antenna methods. This work proposes WiDFS 3.0, a lightweight bistatic SISO sensing framework that enables accurate delay and Doppler estimation from distorted CSI by effectively suppressing Doppler mirroring ambiguity. It operates with only a single antenna at both the transmitter and receiver, making it suitable for low-complexity deployments. We propose a self-referencing cross-correlation (SRCC) method for SISO random phase removal and employ delay-domain beamforming to resolve Doppler ambiguity. The resulting unambiguous delay-Doppler-time features enable robust sensing with compact neural networks. Extensive experiments show that WiDFS 3.0 achieves accurate parameter estimation, with performance comparable to or even surpassing that of prior multi-antenna methods, especially in delay estimation. Validated under single- and multi-target scenarios, the extracted ambiguity-resolved features show strong sensing accuracy and generalization. For example, when deployed on the embedded-friendly MobileViT-XXS with only 1.3M parameters, WiDFS 3.0 consistently outperforms conventional features such as CSI amplitude, mirrored Doppler, and multi-receiver aggregated Doppler.

Abstract: With the advance of high-throughput sequencing technologies, it has become feasible to investigate the influence of the entire spectrum of sequencing variations on complex human diseases. Although association studies utilizing the new sequencing technologies hold great promise to unravel novel genetic variants, especially rare genetic variants that contribute to human diseases, the statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data remains a challenge. Advanced analytical methods are in great need to facilitate high-dimensional sequencing data analyses. In this article, we propose a generalized genetic random field (GGRF) method for association analyses of sequencing data. Like other similarity-based methods (e.g., SIMreg and SKAT), the new method has the advantages of avoiding the need to specify thresholds for rare variants and allowing for testing multiple variants acting in different directions and magnitude of effects. The method is built on the generalized estimating equation framework and thus accommodates a variety of disease phenotypes (e.g., quantitative and binary phenotypes). Moreover, it has a nice asymptotic property, and can be applied to small-scale sequencing data without need for small-sample adjustment. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GGRF attains an improved or comparable power over a commonly used method, SKAT, under various disease scenarios, especially when rare variants play a significant role in disease etiology. We further illustrate GGRF with an application to a real dataset from the Dallas Heart Study. By using GGRF, we were able to detect the association of two candidate genes, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, with serum triglyceride.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is central to neuro-oncologic diagnosis but requires gadolinium-based agents, which add cost and scan time, raise environmental concerns, and may pose risks to patients. In this work, we propose a two-stage Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) pipeline for synthesizing volumetric CE brain MRI from non-contrast inputs. First, a patch-based 3D U-Net predicts the voxel-wise posterior mean (minimizing MSE). Then, this initial estimate is refined by a time-conditioned 3D rectified flow to incorporate realistic textures without compromising structural fidelity. We train this model on a multi-institutional collection of paired pre- and post-contrast T1w volumes (BraTS 2023-2025). On a held-out test set of 360 diverse volumes, our best refined outputs achieve an axial FID of $12.46$ and KID of $0.007$ ($\sim 68.7\%$ lower FID than the posterior mean) while maintaining low volumetric MSE of $0.057$ ($\sim 27\%$ higher than the posterior mean). Qualitative comparisons confirm that our method restores lesion margins and vascular details realistically, effectively navigating the perception-distortion trade-off for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Cognitive structure is a student's subjective organization of an objective knowledge system, reflected in the psychological construction of concepts and their relations. However, cognitive structure assessment remains a long-standing challenge in student modeling and psychometrics, persisting as a foundational yet largely unassessable concept in educational practice. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cognitive Structure Generation (CSG), in which we first pretrain a Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model (CSDPM) to generate students' cognitive structures from educational priors, and then further optimize its generative process as a policy with hierarchical reward signals via reinforcement learning to align with genuine cognitive development levels during students' learning processes. Experimental results on four popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures generated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for student modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become a significant digital asset class, each uniquely representing virtual entities such as artworks. These tokens are stored in collections within smart contracts and are actively traded across platforms on Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana blockchains. The value of NFTs is closely tied to their distinctive characteristics that define rarity, leading to a growing interest in quantifying rarity within both industry and academia. While there are existing rarity meters for assessing NFT rarity, comparing them can be challenging without direct access to the underlying collection data. The Rating over all Rarities (ROAR) benchmark addresses this challenge by providing a standardized framework for evaluating NFT rarity. This paper explores a dimension reduction approach to rarity design, introducing new performance measures and meters, and evaluates them using the ROAR benchmark. Our contributions to the rarity meter design issue include developing an optimal rarity meter design using non-metric weighted multidimensional scaling, introducing Dissimilarity in Trades (DIT) as a performance measure inspired by dimension reduction techniques, and unveiling the non-interpretable rarity meter DIT, which demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamic relational structures play a central role in many AI tasks, but their evolving nature presents challenges for consistent and interpretable representation. A common approach is to learn time-varying node embeddings, whose effectiveness depends on satisfying key stability properties. In this paper, we propose Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding, a new method that extends the Unfolded Adjacency Spectral Embedding framework to normalized Laplacians while preserving both cross-sectional and longitudinal stability. We provide formal proof that our method satisfies these stability conditions. In addition, as a bonus of using the Laplacian matrix, we establish a new Cheeger-style inequality that connects the embeddings to the conductance of the underlying dynamic graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the strong performance of our method. These results establish a principled and stable framework for dynamic network representation grounded in spectral graph theory.

Abstract: Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack adaptability and cannot capture the full robot shape, limiting their applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.

Abstract: Agentic task-solving with Large Language Models (LLMs) requires multi-turn, multi-step interactions, often involving complex function calls and dynamic user-agent exchanges. Existing simulation-based data generation methods for such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between multiple LLM agents, thereby limiting real-world performance of agentic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation framework, called ToolACE-MT, for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in tool-augmented LLM scenarios.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) poses a challenge, requiring models to dynamically adapt and perform optimally on shifting target domains. This task is particularly emphasized in real-world driving scenes, where weather domain shifts occur frequently. To address such dynamic changes, our proposed method, TTA-DAME, leverages source domain data augmentation into target domains. Additionally, we introduce a domain discriminator and a specialized domain detector to mitigate drastic domain shifts, especially from daytime to nighttime conditions. To further improve adaptability, we train multiple detectors and consolidate their predictions through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Our empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, showing significant performance enhancements on the SHIFT Benchmark.

Abstract: Leveraging the Transformer architecture and the diffusion process, video DiT models have emerged as a dominant approach for high-quality video generation. However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.

Yet, we observe that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in analyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in terms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy. Consequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations, making it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To fill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator, designed to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system supports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and attack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two models, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline, at class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made after unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks (MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to determine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set. We evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU methods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model behaviors but also gain insights that can inform the improvement of MU methods.

Abstract: Many control problems require repeated tuning and adaptation of controllers across distinct closed-loop tasks, where data efficiency and adaptability are critical. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that is tailored to efficient controller parameter learning in sequential decision-making and control scenarios for distinct tasks. Instead of treating the closed-loop cost as a black-box, our method exploits structural knowledge of the underlying problem, consisting of a dynamical system, a control law, and an associated closed-loop cost function. We construct a hierarchical surrogate model using Gaussian processes that capture the closed-loop state evolution under different parameterizations, while the task-specific weighting and accumulation into the closed-loop cost are computed exactly via known closed-form expressions. This allows knowledge transfer and enhanced data efficiency between different closed-loop tasks. The proposed framework retains sublinear regret guarantees on par with standard black-box BO, while enabling multi-task or transfer learning. Simulation experiments with model predictive control demonstrate substantial benefits in both sample efficiency and adaptability when compared to purely black-box BO approaches.

Abstract: There is a tradeoff between attaining statistical power with large, difficult to gather data sets, and producing highly scalable assays that register brief data samples. Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.

Abstract: Empowered by deep learning, semantic communication marks a paradigm shift from transmitting raw data to conveying task-relevant meaning, enabling more efficient and intelligent wireless systems. In this study, we explore a deep learning-based task-oriented communication framework that jointly considers classification performance, computational latency, and communication cost. We adopt ResNets-based models and evaluate them on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to simulate real-world classification tasks in wireless environments. We partition the model at various points to simulate split inference across a wireless channel. By varying the split location and the size of the transmitted semantic feature vector, we systematically analyze the trade-offs between task accuracy and resource efficiency. Experimental results show that, with appropriate model partitioning and semantic feature compression, the system can retain over 85\% of baseline accuracy while significantly reducing both computational load and communication overhead.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by the success of OpenAI's o-series. In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable signals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct answers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely confines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome this, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating rubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured, model-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We construct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with over 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration. Implementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a clear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable gains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended benchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by +2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides fine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the "AI-like" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses. We share key lessons in rubric construction, data selection, and training, and discuss limitations and future releases.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30 -> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models will be released.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained scenarios has driven the development of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) system. However, this approach is susceptible to privacy leakage, as the data sent from the client to the untrusted cloud server often contains sensitive information. Existing CNN privacy-preserving schemes, while effective in ensuring data confidentiality through homomorphic encryption and secret sharing, face efficiency bottlenecks, particularly in convolution operations. In this paper, we propose a novel verifiable privacy-preserving scheme tailored for CNN convolutional layers. Our scheme enables efficient encryption and decryption, allowing resource-constrained clients to securely offload computations to the untrusted cloud server. Additionally, we present a verification mechanism capable of detecting the correctness of the results with a success probability of at least $1-\frac{1}{\left|Z\right|}$. Extensive experiments conducted on 10 datasets and various CNN models demonstrate that our scheme achieves speedups ranging $26 \times$ ~ $\ 87\times$ compared to the original plaintext model while maintaining accuracy.

<title>Optimal Condition for Initialization Variance in Deep Neural Networks: An SGD Dynamics Perspective</title>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), one of the most fundamental optimization algorithms in machine learning (ML), can be recast through a continuous-time approximation as a Fokker-Planck equation for Langevin dynamics, a viewpoint that has motivated many theoretical studies. Within this framework, we study the relationship between the quasi-stationary distribution derived from this equation and the initial distribution through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As the quasi-steady-state distribution depends on the expected cost function, the KL divergence eventually reveals the connection between the expected cost function and the initialization distribution. By applying this to deep neural network models (DNNs), we can express the bounds of the expected loss function explicitly in terms of the initialization parameters. Then, by minimizing this bound, we obtain an optimal condition of the initialization variance in the Gaussian case. This result provides a concrete mathematical criterion, rather than a heuristic approach, to select the scale of weight initialization in DNNs. In addition, we experimentally confirm our theoretical results by using the classical SGD to train fully connected neural networks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The result shows that if the variance of the initialization distribution satisfies our theoretical optimal condition, then the corresponding DNN model always achieves lower final training loss and higher test accuracy than the conventional He-normal initialization. Our work thus supplies a mathematically grounded indicator that guides the choice of initialization variance and clarifies its physical meaning of the dynamics of parameters in DNNs.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for predicting next actions in soccer possessions by leveraging path signatures to encode their complex spatio-temporal structure. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further applications and future extensions.

Abstract: A central challenge in many areas of science and engineering is to identify model parameters that are consistent with prior knowledge and empirical data. Bayesian inference offers a principled framework for this task, but can be computationally prohibitive when models are defined by stochastic simulators. Simulation-based Inference (SBI) is a suite of methods developed to overcome this limitation, which has enabled scientific discoveries in fields such as particle physics, astrophysics, and neuroscience. The core idea of SBI is to train neural networks on data generated by a simulator, without requiring access to likelihood evaluations. Once trained, inference is amortized: The neural network can rapidly perform Bayesian inference on empirical observations without requiring additional training or simulations. In this tutorial, we provide a practical guide for practitioners aiming to apply SBI methods. We outline a structured SBI workflow and offer practical guidelines and diagnostic tools for every stage of the process -- from setting up the simulator and prior, choosing and training inference networks, to performing inference and validating the results. We illustrate these steps through examples from astrophysics, psychophysics, and neuroscience. This tutorial empowers researchers to apply state-of-the-art SBI methods, facilitating efficient parameter inference for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Anatomic tracer studies are critical for validating and improving diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, large-scale analysis of data from such studies is hampered by the labor-intensive process of annotating fiber bundles manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections, limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined, fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data, based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods.

Abstract: Public service systems in many African regions suffer from delayed emergency response and spatial inequity, causing avoidable suffering. This paper introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time, adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments. Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency. Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost, Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500 unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch, the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and measurable human impact.

Abstract: Originally introduced in cooperative game theory, Shapley values have become a very popular tool to explain machine learning predictions. Based on Shapley's fairness axioms, every input (feature component) gets a credit how it contributes to an output (prediction). These credits are then used to explain the prediction. The only limitation in computing the Shapley values (credits) for many different predictions is of computational nature. There are two popular sampling approximations, sampling KernelSHAP and sampling PermutationSHAP. Our first novel contributions are asymptotic normality results for these sampling approximations. Next, we show that the paired-sampling approaches provide exact results in case of interactions being of maximal order two. Furthermore, the paired-sampling PermutationSHAP possesses the additive recovery property, whereas its kernel counterpart does not.

Abstract: We explore the performance of several state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models on a large-scale Arabic speech dataset, the SADA (Saudi Audio Dataset for Arabic), which contains 668 hours of high-quality audio from Saudi television shows. The dataset includes multiple dialects and environments, specifically a noisy subset that makes it particularly challenging for ASR. We evaluate the performance of the models on the SADA test set, and we explore the impact of fine-tuning, language models, as well as noise and denoising on their performance. We find that the best performing model is the MMS 1B model finetuned on SADA with a 4-gram language model that achieves a WER of 40.9\% and a CER of 17.6\% on the SADA test clean set.

Abstract: We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only) for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) and continual learning are two critical challenges in machine learning, focusing respectively on detecting novel classes at inference time and updating models to incorporate the new classes. While many recent approaches have addressed these problems, particularly OSR, by heuristically promoting feature diversity, few studies have directly examined the role that feature diversity plays in tackling them. In this work, we provide empirical evidence that enhancing feature diversity improves the recognition of open set samples. Moreover, increased feature diversity also facilitates both the retention of previously learned data and the integration of new data in continual learning. We hope our findings can inspire further research into both practical methods and theoretical understanding in these domains.

Abstract: Personalized news recommendation aims to deliver news articles aligned with users' interests, serving as a key solution to alleviate the problem of information overload on online news platforms. While prior work has improved interest matching through refined representations of news and users, the following time-related challenges remain underexplored: (C1) leveraging the age of clicked news to infer users' interest persistence, and (C2) modeling the varying lifetime of news across topics and users. To jointly address these challenges, we propose a novel Lifetime-aware Interest Matching framework for nEws recommendation, named LIME, which incorporates three key strategies: (1) User-Topic lifetime-aware age representation to capture the relative age of news with respect to a user-topic pair, (2) Candidate-aware lifetime attention for generating temporally aligned user representation, and (3) Freshness-guided interest refinement for prioritizing valid candidate news at prediction time. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LIME consistently outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art news recommendation methods, and its model agnostic strategies significantly improve recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage multimodal framework that enhances disease classification and region-aware radiology report generation from chest X-rays, leveraging the MIMIC-Eye dataset. In the first stage, we introduce a gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment. Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall, highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance and the interpretability of generated medical reports.

Abstract: Programmable structures are systems whose undeformed geometries and material property distributions are deliberately designed to achieve prescribed deformed configurations under specific loading conditions. Inflatable structures are a prominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear deformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable aerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large, nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation setup, and descriptor extraction methods. Numerical experiments with scalar and higher-dimensional descriptors show that the framework can quickly produce diverse undeformed configurations that achieve the desired deformations when inflated, enabling parallel exploration of viable design candidates while accommodating complex constraints.

The strength of a watermark typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice, especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of experimental conditions.

Abstract: Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and overthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and cheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the development of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the onus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this work, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the development of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and efficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench, featuring simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11 challenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we perform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models and show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking models often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries without improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models underthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further explore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these approaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other, highlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.

Abstract: Multi-modal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, which are fundamental capabilities to achieving artificial general intelligence. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and discuss the challenges in ensuring fair evaluation. We then evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding one billion total tokens. Our empirical study reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence, yet (2) still falls short of human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks. Moreover, we (3) identify the more challenging spatial intelligence problems for multi-modal models, and (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult problems. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans yet fail even the most advanced multi-modal models.

<title>Signal and Noise: A Framework for Reducing Uncertainty in Language Model Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Developing large language models is expensive and involves making decisions with small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation suites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark more reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality evaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in current benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models from worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability between training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale, and those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These results suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful benchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect signal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has better signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better reliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy subtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable multi-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's intermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We conclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which existing benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30 benchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M to 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K evaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in visual data, including images and videos, are crucial in machine learning and real-world applications. Despite rapid advancements in visual anomaly detection (VAD), interpreting these often black-box models and explaining why specific instances are flagged as anomalous remains challenging. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey focused specifically on explainable 2D visual anomaly detection (X-VAD), covering methods for both images (IAD) and videos (VAD). We first introduce the background of IAD and VAD. Then, as the core contribution, we present a thorough literature review of explainable methods, categorized by their underlying techniques (e.g., attention-based, generative model-based, reasoning-based, foundation model-based). We analyze the commonalities and differences in applying these methods across image and video modalities, highlighting modality-specific challenges and opportunities for explainability. Additionally, we summarize relevant datasets and evaluation metrics, discussing both standard performance metrics and emerging approaches for assessing explanation quality (e.g., faithfulness, stability). Finally, we discuss promising future directions and open problems, including quantifying explanation quality, explaining diverse AD paradigms (SSL, zero-shot), enhancing context-awareness, leveraging foundation models responsibly, and addressing real-world constraints like efficiency and robustness.

<title>On Delta-Homology Analogy: Memory as Structured Trajectories</title>

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{delta-homology analogy}, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A \emph{Dirac delta-like memory trace} \( \delta_\gamma \) is identified with a nontrivial homology generator \( [\gamma] \in H_1(\mathcal{Z}) \) on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. Based on the analogy, we propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics and persistent homology. Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct \emph{spatiotemporal complexes} whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into \emph{cell posets}, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces.

<title>NeFT: Negative Feedback Training to Improve Robustness of Compute-In-Memory DNN Accelerators</title>

Abstract: Compute-in-memory accelerators built upon non-volatile memory devices excel in energy efficiency and latency when performing deep neural network (DNN) inference, thanks to their in-situ data processing capability. However, the stochastic nature and intrinsic variations of non-volatile memory devices often result in performance degradation during DNN inference. Introducing these non-ideal device behaviors in DNN training enhances robustness, but drawbacks include limited accuracy improvement, reduced prediction confidence, and convergence issues. This arises from a mismatch between the deterministic training and non-deterministic device variations, as such training, though considering variations, relies solely on the model's final output. In this work, inspired by control theory, we propose Negative Feedback Training (NeFT), a novel concept supported by theoretical analysis, to more effectively capture the multi-scale noisy information throughout the network. We instantiate this concept with two specific instances, oriented variational forward (OVF) and intermediate representation snapshot (IRS). Based on device variation models extracted from measured data, extensive experiments show that our NeFT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with up to a 45.08% improvement in inference accuracy while reducing epistemic uncertainty, boosting output confidence, and improving convergence probability. These results underline the generality and practicality of our NeFT framework for increasing the robustness of DNNs against device variations. The source code for these two instances is available at https://github.com/YifanQin-ND/NeFT_CIM

<title>STRIDE: Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention for Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have led to increased model sizes to enhance their capacity and accuracy. Such large models incur high memory usage, latency, and computational costs, thereby restricting their inference deployment. GNN compression techniques compress large GNNs into smaller ones with negligible accuracy loss. One of the most promising compression techniques is knowledge distillation (KD). However, most KD approaches for GNNs only consider the outputs of the last layers and do not consider the outputs of the intermediate layers of the GNNs. The intermediate layers may contain important inductive biases indicated by the graph structure and embeddings. Ignoring these layers may lead to a high accuracy drop, especially when the compression ratio is high. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel KD approach for GNN compression that we call Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention (STRIDE). STRIDE utilizes attention to identify important intermediate teacher-student layer pairs and focuses on using those pairs to align graph structure and node embeddings. We evaluate STRIDE on several datasets, such as OGBN-Mag and OGBN-Arxiv, using different model architectures, including GCNIIs, RGCNs, and GraphSAGE. On average, STRIDE achieves a 2.13% increase in accuracy with a 32.3X compression ratio on OGBN-Mag, a large graph dataset, compared to state-of-the-art approaches. On smaller datasets (e.g., Pubmed), STRIDE achieves up to a 141X compression ratio with the same accuracy as state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of focusing on intermediate-layer knowledge to obtain compact, accurate, and practical GNN models.

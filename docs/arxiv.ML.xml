Summary: 
Asymmetric LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE) is introduced as a noise-robust adaptation method for pre-trained language models in downstream tasks. LoPE enhances model robustness to noise by strategically integrating a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA configuration. Through a two-stage paradigm, noise injection is performed on the poisoning expert during fine-tuning, improving its noise discrimination and processing ability. During inference, the dedicated poisoning expert is selectively masked to utilize purified knowledge acquired by normal experts for noise-robust output. Extensive experiments show that LoPE achieves strong performance and robustness through low-cost noise injection, eliminating the need for data cleaning. <div>

Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks are susceptible to interference from noisy data. Conventional noise-handling approaches either rely on laborious data pre-processing or employ model architecture modifications prone to error accumulation. In contrast to existing noise-process paradigms, we propose a noise-robust adaptation method via asymmetric LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE), a novel framework that enhances model robustness to noise only with generated noisy data. Drawing inspiration from the mixture-of-experts architecture, LoPE strategically integrates a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA configuration. Through a two-stage paradigm, LoPE performs noise injection on the poisoning expert during fine-tuning to enhance its noise discrimination and processing ability. During inference, we selectively mask the dedicated poisoning expert to leverage purified knowledge acquired by normal experts for noise-robust output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoPE achieves strong performance and robustness purely through the low-cost noise injection, which completely eliminates the requirement of data cleaning.

Summary: Sparse autoencoders and Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) are utilized to decompose language model activations in the Flux 1 text-to-image diffusion model. The study finds that Sparse Autoencoders accurately reconstruct embeddings and outperform MLP neurons in interpretability. These embeddings can be used to control image generation through activation addition. ITDA demonstrates comparable interpretability to Sparse Autoencoders in this context. The research showcases the effectiveness of these techniques in understanding and controlling the representations within a large-scale text-to-image model, pointing towards their potential applications in various domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a promising new approach for decomposing language model activations for interpretation and control. They have been applied successfully to vision transformer image encoders and to small-scale diffusion models. Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline. We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image generation through activation addition. We find that ITDA has comparable interpretability to SAEs.

<div> binning, time series forecasting, regression, binary cumulative encoding, convolutional neural network

Summary:
The study focuses on time series forecasting, where regression is reformulated as a classification problem by discretizing the continuous target space into bins. Existing methods often use one-hot encoding, ignoring the ordinal structure of values and failing to capture relative distance information during training. To address this limitation, the paper introduces binary cumulative encoding (BCE) that represents scalar targets as monotonic binary vectors, maintaining order and magnitude information. A specialized convolutional neural network architecture for BCE is proposed, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions for efficient temporal modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach outperforms traditional methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, with improved performance, reduced parameter requirements, and faster training times.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding (BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.

Summary: 
The paper presents a new benchmark framework for evaluating Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) instance generation methods. The framework assesses instance quality based on dimensions such as mathematical validity, structural similarity, computational hardness, and utility in machine learning tasks. A key feature is the analysis of solver-internal features to compare solver outputs and reveal computational resemblances. The framework offers solver-independent and solver-dependent metrics for robust comparisons among generation techniques. It aims to improve the quality of instance generators and enhance research reliability using synthetic MILP data. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through comparisons of contemporary generative models. <div>

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is fundamental to solving complex decision-making problems. The proliferation of MILP instance generation methods, driven by machine learning's demand for diverse optimization datasets and the limitations of static benchmarks, has significantly outpaced standardized evaluation techniques. Consequently, assessing the fidelity and utility of synthetic MILP instances remains a critical, multifaceted challenge. This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark framework designed for the systematic and objective evaluation of MILP instance generation methods. Our framework provides a unified and extensible methodology, assessing instance quality across crucial dimensions: mathematical validity, structural similarity, computational hardness, and utility in downstream machine learning tasks. A key innovation is its in-depth analysis of solver-internal features -- particularly by comparing distributions of key solver outputs including root node gap, heuristic success rates, and cut plane usage -- leveraging the solver's dynamic solution behavior as an `expert assessment' to reveal nuanced computational resemblances. By offering a structured approach with clearly defined solver-independent and solver-dependent metrics, our benchmark aims to facilitate robust comparisons among diverse generation techniques, spur the development of higher-quality instance generators, and ultimately enhance the reliability of research reliant on synthetic MILP data. The framework's effectiveness in systematically comparing the fidelity of instance sets is demonstrated using contemporary generative models.

<div> dynamic clustering, worst-case recourse, constant-factor approximation, deterministic algorithms, point updates<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This paper addresses the problem of maintaining a constant-factor approximation to the k-clustering problem in a fully dynamic setting where point updates can be insertions or deletions. The focus is on the k-center objective, aiming to minimize the recourse per update. The authors present a deterministic algorithm that achieves optimal worst-case recourse of 1 per update, outperforming previous work. They also introduce new decremental and incremental algorithms that maintain a 6-approximate k-center solution with the same optimal worst-case recourse. The deterministic nature of these algorithms enables them to combat adaptive adversaries efficiently. The proposed algorithms rely on simple choices and light data structures, making them straightforward and fast compared to previous complex approaches. This research contributes to advancing the understanding and practicality of consistent clustering in dynamic environments. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2412.03238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given points from an arbitrary metric space and a sequence of point updates sent by an adversary, what is the minimum recourse per update (i.e., the minimum number of changes needed to the set of centers after an update), in order to maintain a constant-factor approximation to a $k$-clustering problem? This question has received attention in recent years under the name consistent clustering.
  Previous works by Lattanzi and Vassilvitskii [ICLM '17] and Fichtenberger, Lattanzi, Norouzi-Fard, and Svensson [SODA '21] studied $k$-clustering objectives, including the $k$-center and the $k$-median objectives, under only point insertions. In this paper we study the $k$-center objective in the fully dynamic setting, where the update is either a point insertion or a point deletion. Before our work, {\L}\k{a}cki, Haeupler, Grunau, Rozho\v{n}, and Jayaram [SODA '24] gave a deterministic fully dynamic constant-factor approximation algorithm for the $k$-center objective with worst-case recourse of $2$ per update.
  In this work, we prove that the $k$-center clustering problem admits optimal recourse bounds by developing a deterministic fully dynamic constant-factor approximation algorithm with worst-case recourse of $1$ per update. Moreover our algorithm performs simple choices based on light data structures, and thus is arguably more direct and faster than the previous one which uses a sophisticated combinatorial structure. Additionally, we develop a new deterministic decremental algorithm and a new deterministic incremental algorithm, both of which maintain a $6$-approximate $k$-center solution with worst-case recourse of $1$ per update. Our incremental algorithm improves over the $8$-approximation algorithm by Charikar, Chekuri, Feder, and Motwani [STOC '97]. Finally, we remark that since all three of our algorithms are deterministic, they work against an adaptive adversary.

Summary: 
Prisma is an open-source framework aimed at advancing research in vision mechanistic interpretability. It offers a comprehensive toolkit with access to 75+ vision and video transformers, support for various training methods like sparse autoencoder, and a range of pre-trained weights. The framework also includes activation caching, circuit analysis tools, and visualization tools to aid in understanding model internals. Surprisingly, the analysis reveals that effective vision sparse autoencoders exhibit different sparsity patterns compared to language models, and in some cases, reconstructions can actually reduce model loss. This tool opens up new research opportunities in understanding vision models while making the field more accessible for researchers. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Robust tooling and publicly available pre-trained models have helped drive recent advances in mechanistic interpretability for language models. However, similar progress in vision mechanistic interpretability has been hindered by the lack of accessible frameworks and pre-trained weights. We present Prisma (Access the codebase here: https://github.com/Prisma-Multimodal/ViT-Prisma), an open-source framework designed to accelerate vision mechanistic interpretability research, providing a unified toolkit for accessing 75+ vision and video transformers; support for sparse autoencoder (SAE), transcoder, and crosscoder training; a suite of 80+ pre-trained SAE weights; activation caching, circuit analysis tools, and visualization tools; and educational resources. Our analysis reveals surprising findings, including that effective vision SAEs can exhibit substantially lower sparsity patterns than language SAEs, and that in some instances, SAE reconstructions can decrease model loss. Prisma enables new research directions for understanding vision model internals while lowering barriers to entry in this emerging field.

Summary: 
The article explores the role of symmetry in neural networks and optimization problems. It investigates symmetry phenomena in real-valued loss functions on various spaces, including the projective case over a finite field, octahedral graph case, perfect matching case, and particle attraction case. The study finds that critical points in these cases exhibit significant symmetry with non-trivial symmetry structures. It introduces a new measure of symmetry in the system that reveals additional symmetry not captured by previous measures. The research extends the understanding of symmetry in mathematical structures and highlights its importance in optimization problems and neural networks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of mathematical structures and optimization problems. Recent work has explored this phenomenon in the context of neural networks, where the loss function is invariant under column and row permutations of the network weights. It has been observed that local minima exhibit significant symmetry with respect to the network weights (invariance to row and column permutations). And moreover no critical point was found that lacked symmetry. We extend this line of inquiry by investigating symmetry phenomena in real-valued loss functions defined on a broader class of spaces. We will introduce four more cases: the projective case over a finite field, the octahedral graph case, the perfect matching case, and the particle attraction case. We show that as in the neural network case, all the critical points observed have non-trivial symmetry. Finally we introduce a new measure of symmetry in the system and show that it reveals additional symmetry structures not captured by the previous measure.

Summary: 
The study introduces GNN-ADG, a method that utilizes Graph Neural Networks and adversarial learning to improve the cross-user generalization in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition systems. GNN-ADG models spatial relationships between sensors on different body parts by extracting Anatomical Units: Interconnected, Analogous, and Lateral Units. These units are fused into a unified graph structure with a cyclic training strategy to capture holistic, user-invariant representations. The model iteratively cycles through edge topologies during training to refine its understanding of inter-sensor relationships. By representing sensor spatial configurations as a graph and incorporating adversarial learning, GNN-ADG effectively learns features that generalize well to unseen users without using target user data during training. This approach demonstrates practicality for real-world applications in Human Activity Recognition systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-user variability poses a significant challenge in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems, as traditional models struggle to generalize across users due to differences in behavior, sensor placement, and data distribution. To address this, we propose GNN-ADG (Graph Neural Network with Adversarial Domain Generalization), a novel method that leverages both the strength from both the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and adversarial learning to achieve robust cross-user generalization. GNN-ADG models spatial relationships between sensors on different anatomical body parts, extracting three types of Anatomical Units: (1) Interconnected Units, capturing inter-relations between neighboring sensors; (2) Analogous Units, grouping sensors on symmetrical or functionally similar body parts; and (3) Lateral Units, connecting sensors based on their position to capture region-specific coordination. These units information are fused into an unified graph structure with a cyclic training strategy, dynamically integrating spatial, functional, and lateral correlations to facilitate a holistic, user-invariant representation. Information fusion mechanism of GNN-ADG occurs by iteratively cycling through edge topologies during training, allowing the model to refine its understanding of inter-sensor relationships across diverse perspectives. By representing the spatial configuration of sensors as an unified graph and incorporating adversarial learning, Information Fusion GNN-ADG effectively learns features that generalize well to unseen users without requiring target user data during training, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: We present a novel non attention based architecture for large language models (LLMs) that efficiently handles very long context windows, on the order of hundreds of thousands to potentially millions of tokens. Unlike traditional Transformer designs, which suffer from quadratic memory and computation overload due to the nature of the self attention mechanism, our model avoids token to token attention entirely. Instead, it combines the following complementary components: State Space blocks (inspired by S4) that learn continuous time convolution kernels and scale near linearly with sequence length, Multi Resolution Convolution layers that capture local context at different dilation levels, a lightweight Recurrent Supervisor to maintain a global hidden state across sequential chunks, and Retrieval Augmented External Memory that stores and retrieves high-level chunk embeddings without reintroducing quadratic operations.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of trips between zones is critical for transportation planning, as it supports resource allocation and infrastructure development across various modes of transport. Although the gravity model has been widely used due to its simplicity, it often inadequately represents the complex factors influencing modern travel behavior. This study introduces a data-driven approach to enhance the gravity model by integrating geographical, economic, social, and travel data from the counties in Tennessee and New York state. Using machine learning techniques, we extend the capabilities of the traditional model to handle more complex interactions between variables. Our experiments demonstrate that machine learning-enhanced models significantly outperform the traditional model. Our results show a 51.48% improvement in R-squared, indicating a substantial enhancement in the model's explanatory power. Also, a 63.59% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reflects a significant increase in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a 44.32% increase in Common Part of Commuters (CPC) demonstrates improved prediction reliability. These findings highlight the substantial benefits of integrating diverse datasets and advanced algorithms into transportation models. They provide urban planners and policymakers with more reliable forecasting and decision-making tools.

Summary: TaskVAE is a framework for replay-based continual learning in class-incremental settings, using task-specific Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks for training alongside new task data. Focusing on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with individual user data, it outperforms experience replay methods in limited data scenarios and scales well with dataset size. TaskVAE has minimal memory footprint, generating unlimited synthetic samples with only 60 samples per task. Its contributions include balancing memory constraints, task-specific generation, and long-term stability, making it a reliable solution for real-world applications like HAR. <div>

Abstract: As machine learning based systems become more integrated into daily life, they unlock new opportunities but face the challenge of adapting to dynamic data environments. Various forms of data shift-gradual, abrupt, or cyclic-threaten model accuracy, making continual adaptation essential. Continual Learning (CL) enables models to learn from evolving data streams while minimizing forgetting of prior knowledge. Among CL strategies, replay-based methods have proven effective, but their success relies on balancing memory constraints and retaining old class accuracy while learning new classes. This paper presents TaskVAE, a framework for replay-based CL in class-incremental settings. TaskVAE employs task-specific Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks, which are then used to train the classifier alongside new task data. In contrast to traditional methods that require prior knowledge of the total class count or rely on a single VAE for all tasks, TaskVAE adapts flexibly to increasing tasks without such constraints. We focus on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using IMU sensor-equipped devices. Unlike previous HAR studies that combine data across all users, our approach focuses on individual user data, better reflecting real-world scenarios where a person progressively learns new activities. Extensive experiments on 5 different HAR datasets show that TaskVAE outperforms experience replay methods, particularly with limited data, and exhibits robust performance as dataset size increases. Additionally, memory footprint of TaskVAE is minimal, being equivalent to only 60 samples per task, while still being able to generate an unlimited number of synthetic samples. The contributions lie in balancing memory constraints, task-specific generation, and long-term stability, making it a reliable solution for real-world applications in domains like HAR.

Summary: 
In this study, a unified matrix-order framework is introduced to reveal the commonalities among different types of deep neural networks. Convolutional, recurrent, and self-attention operations are represented as sparse matrix multiplications, with convolution being achieved through an upper-triangular weight matrix, recurrence from a lower-triangular matrix, and attention as a third-order tensor factorization. The researchers prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN, and Transformer layers. Empirical evaluations across various tasks including image classification, time-series forecasting, and language modeling confirm that sparse-matrix formulations achieve comparable or better performance with fewer epochs. This approach simplifies architecture design by focusing on sparse pattern selection, aligns well with GPU parallelism, and utilizes existing algebraic optimization tools. The study establishes a strong mathematical foundation for diverse neural architectures and presents opportunities for principled, hardware-aware network design.

Abstract: Deep neural networks employ specialized architectures for vision, sequential and language tasks, yet this proliferation obscures their underlying commonalities. We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet), time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.

The article explores the challenges of quantizing Large Language Models (LLMs) due to outliers in the data and their impact on quantization error. It introduces a new metric based on channel magnitudes to measure and visualize the difficulty of quantization. The study investigates how smoothing and rotation can transform outlier values. A hybrid approach is proposed, involving channel-wise scaling before rotation, with a mathematical formulation to demonstrate its benefits. By addressing the issues posed by outliers in LLMs, the research aims to improve the efficiency and performance of quantization techniques for large models, ultimately reducing serving costs. <div>

Abstract: Quantization effectively reduces the serving costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) by speeding up data movement through compressed parameters and enabling faster operations via integer arithmetic. However, activating integer arithmetic requires quantizing both weights and activations, which poses challenges due to the significant outliers in LLMs that increase quantization error. In this work, we investigate these outliers with an emphasis on their effect on layer-wise quantization error, then examine how smoothing and rotation transform the observed values. Our primary contributions include introducing a new metric to measure and visualize quantization difficulty based on channel magnitudes, as well as proposing a hybrid approach that applies channel-wise scaling before rotation, supported by a mathematical formulation of its benefits.

Summary:
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown impressive performance but face challenges in resource-constrained environments. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency but suffer from accuracy loss during conversion. This paper proposes a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework using error compensation learning. It introduces features like a learnable threshold clipping function, dual-threshold neurons, and an optimized membrane potential initialization strategy to address conversion errors. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate high accuracy and ultra-low latency. The method reduces inference time significantly with competitive accuracy of 94.75% on CIFAR-10 under ResNet-18 structure using only two time steps. This research enables the practical application of SNNs on low-power hardware, facilitating efficient real-time processing.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) operate through discrete spike events and offer superior energy efficiency, providing a bio-inspired alternative. However, current ANN-to-SNN conversion often results in significant accuracy loss and increased inference time due to conversion errors such as clipping, quantization, and uneven activation. This paper proposes a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework based on error compensation learning. We introduce a learnable threshold clipping function, dual-threshold neurons, and an optimized membrane potential initialization strategy to mitigate the conversion error. Together, these techniques address the clipping error through adaptive thresholds, dynamically reduce the quantization error through dual-threshold neurons, and minimize the non-uniformity error by effectively managing the membrane potential. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets show that our method achieves high-precision and ultra-low latency among existing conversion methods. Using only two time steps, our method significantly reduces the inference time while maintains competitive accuracy of 94.75% on CIFAR-10 dataset under ResNet-18 structure. This research promotes the practical application of SNNs on low-power hardware, making efficient real-time processing possible.

Abstract: This paper thoroughly investigates the challenges of enhancing AI's abstract reasoning capabilities, with a particular focus on Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) tasks involving complex human-like concepts. Firstly, it dissects the empirical reality that traditional end-to-end RPM-solving models heavily rely on option pool configurations, highlighting that this dependency constrains the model's reasoning capabilities. To address this limitation, the paper proposes the Johnny architecture - a novel representation space-based framework for RPM-solving. Through the synergistic operation of its Representation Extraction Module and Reasoning Module, Johnny significantly enhances reasoning performance by supplementing primitive negative option configurations with a learned representation space. Furthermore, to strengthen the model's capacity for capturing positional relationships among local features, the paper introduces the Spin-Transformer network architecture, accompanied by a lightweight Straw Spin-Transformer variant that reduces computational overhead through parameter sharing and attention mechanism optimization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that both Johnny and Spin-Transformer achieve superior performance on RPM tasks, offering innovative methodologies for advancing AI's abstract reasoning capabilities.

Summary: 
This paper explores the factors contributing to the success of reusing pre-trained neural networks in machine learning tasks. The study introduces an experimental setup to investigate the impact of task correlation on the performance of reusing a model. It is found that Bob's success in reusing Alice's network may be attributed to luck, as task accuracy increases with the correlation between tasks. Even with uncorrelated tasks and features, Bob can achieve better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer. When tasks have little correlation, it is preferable to only reuse lower pre-trained layers. The optimal number of retrained layers may indicate task and feature correlation. Real-world scenarios demonstrate that semantic correlations between tasks enable effective reuse of pre-trained networks. <div>

Abstract: Pre-trained neural networks are commonly used and reused in the machine learning community. Alice trains a model for a particular task, and a part of her neural network is reused by Bob for a different task, often to great effect. To what can we ascribe Bob's success? This paper introduces an experimental setup through which factors contributing to Bob's empirical success could be studied in silico. As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer. When there is little correlation between tasks, only reusing lower pre-trained layers is preferable, and we hypothesize the converse: that the optimal number of retrained layers is indicative of task and feature correlation. Finally, we show in controlled real-world scenarios that Bob can effectively reuse Alice's pre-trained network if there are semantic correlations between his and Alice's task.

Summary:
The study focuses on accurately modeling crack propagation in engineering materials and structures using data from CPD simulations to train Deep Operator Networks. Two variants of DeepONets, vanilla, and Fusion, are explored for predicting crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. The models are trained on geometric inputs and spatial-temporal coordinates. Fusion DeepONet outperforms the vanilla variant, particularly in non-fracturing cases. Challenges remain in accurately predicting fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution. The findings demonstrate the Fusion DeepONet's potential to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena. <div>
arXiv:2506.01976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained on 32 to 45 samples, using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging. These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces GEDRanker, an unsupervised GAN-based framework for computing Graph Edit Distance (GED). It utilizes a matching-based GED solver and a preference-aware discriminator to generate high-quality node matching without requiring ground-truth supervision. By incorporating an effective training strategy, GEDRanker guides the GED solver to achieve near-optimal solution quality on benchmark datasets. This approach overcomes the need for costly ground-truth labels in real-world scenarios, making GED computation more accessible and efficient. The hybrid GED solver formulates GED as a bipartite graph matching problem and uses a generative diffusion model to predict node matching, resulting in accurate GED calculation. GEDRanker enhances the performance of the GED solver by providing interpretable preferences and training guidance, demonstrating significant advancements in unsupervised GED computation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.01977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a fundamental graph similarity metric widely used in various applications. However, computing GED is an NP-hard problem. Recent state-of-the-art hybrid GED solver has shown promising performance by formulating GED as a bipartite graph matching problem, then leveraging a generative diffusion model to predict node matching between two graphs, from which both the GED and its corresponding edit path can be extracted using a traditional algorithm. However, such methods typically rely heavily on ground-truth supervision, where the ground-truth labels are often costly to obtain in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose GEDRanker, a novel unsupervised GAN-based framework for GED computation. Specifically, GEDRanker consists of a matching-based GED solver and introduces an interpretable preference-aware discriminator with an effective training strategy to guide the matching-based GED solver toward generating high-quality node matching without the need for ground-truth labels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our GEDRanker enables the matching-based GED solver to achieve near-optimal solution quality without any ground-truth supervision.

<br />
Summary: SpecMemo is a device-aware inference engine designed to enable multi-turn chatbots with speculative decoding on memory-constrained devices. It smartly controls memory allocations to balance minimizing redundant allocations for rejected tokens while maintaining performance gains from speculation. With SpecMemo, 96% of overall throughput is maintained with a 65% reduction in generation-memory on a single Nvidia Titan RTX. By distributing the Llama-2-70B-Chat model on multiple constrained GPUs, a 2x speedup over distributed and batched vanilla decoding is achieved, with an 8x increase in inference throughput with a batch size of 10. This work aims to democratize large language model applications in resource-constrained environments, enabling faster and more cost-effective deployment of real-world applications with robust performance. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in speculative decoding have demonstrated considerable speedup across a wide array of large language model (LLM) tasks. Speculative decoding inherently relies on sacrificing extra memory allocations to generate several candidate tokens, of which acceptance rate drives the speedup. However, deploying speculative decoding on memory-constrained devices, such as mobile GPUs, remains as a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a device-aware inference engine named SpecMemo that can smartly control memory allocations at finer levels to enable multi-turn chatbots with speculative decoding on such limited memory devices. Our methodology stems from theoretically modeling memory footprint of speculative decoding to determine a lower bound on the required memory budget while retaining speedup. SpecMemo empirically acquires a careful balance between minimizing redundant memory allocations for rejected candidate tokens and maintaining competitive performance gains from speculation. Notably, with SpecMemo's memory management, we maintain 96% of overall throughput from speculative decoding on MT-Bench, with reduced generation-memory by 65% on single Nvidia Titan RTX. Given multiple constrained GPUs, we build on top of previous speculative decoding architectures to facilitate big-model inference by distributing Llama-2-70B-Chat model, on which we provide novel batched speculative decoding to increase usability of multiple small server GPUs. This novel framework demonstrates 2x speedup over distributed and batched vanilla decoding with the base model on eight AMD MI250 GPUs. Moreover, inference throughput increases remarkably 8x with batch size 10. Our work contributes to democratized LLM applications in resource-constrained environments, providing a pathway for faster and cheaper deployment of real-world LLM applications with robust performance.

arXiv:2506.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data inherently possesses dual attributes: samples and targets. For targets, knowledge distillation has been widely employed to accelerate model convergence, primarily relying on teacher-generated soft target supervision. Conversely, recent advancements in data-efficient learning have emphasized sample optimization techniques, such as dataset distillation, while neglected the critical role of target. This dichotomy motivates our investigation into understanding how both sample and target collectively influence training dynamic. To address this gap, we first establish a taxonomy of existing paradigms through the lens of sample-target interactions, categorizing them into distinct sample-to-target mapping strategies. Building upon this foundation, we then propose a novel unified loss framework to assess their impact on training efficiency. Through extensive empirical studies on our proposed strategies, we comprehensively analyze how variations in target and sample types, quantities, and qualities influence model training, providing six key insights to enhance training efficacy.

Summary: 
The article introduces the use of random forest models in health informatics, highlighting their benefits in improving interpretability of feature interactions. However, the complexity of these models can hinder accurate interpretation by domain experts, affecting trust and regulatory compliance. To address this issue, the surrogate interpretability graph method is proposed, utilizing graphs and linear programming to analyze and visualize feature interactions. This approach enhances global interpretability by providing insights into feature usage and dominant hierarchical decision feature interactions for predictions. The implementation of the surrogate interpretability graph can significantly improve the interpretability of random forest models in the high-stakes domain of health informatics. <div>

Abstract: The field of health informatics has been profoundly influenced by the development of random forest models, which have led to significant advances in the interpretability of feature interactions. These models are characterized by their robustness to overfitting and parallelization, making them particularly useful in this domain. However, the increasing number of features and estimators in random forests can prevent domain experts from accurately interpreting global feature interactions, thereby compromising trust and regulatory compliance. A method called the surrogate interpretability graph has been developed to address this issue. It uses graphs and mixed-integer linear programming to analyze and visualize feature interactions. This improves their interpretability by visualizing the feature usage per decision-feature-interaction table and the most dominant hierarchical decision feature interactions for predictions. The implementation of a surrogate interpretable graph enhances global interpretability, which is critical for such a high-stakes domain.

Summary:
The paper investigates distributed learning in the presence of Byzantine attacks. Current methods using robust bounded aggregation (RBA) rules suffer from degraded performance due to significant variations in local gradients from different devices. To address this issue, a new method called coded robust aggregation (CRA-DL) is proposed. CRA-DL allocates training data redundantly to devices and uses coded gradients for information transmission. The server aggregates honest and Byzantine device information using RBA rules, enhancing robustness against attacks. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the convergence performance of CRA-DL. Numerical results show the method's superiority over existing baselines, with enhanced learning performance under Byzantine attacks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.01989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of distributed learning (DL) in the presence of Byzantine attacks. For this problem, various robust bounded aggregation (RBA) rules have been proposed at the central server to mitigate the impact of Byzantine attacks. However, current DL methods apply RBA rules for the local gradients from the honest devices and the disruptive information from Byzantine devices, and the learning performance degrades significantly when the local gradients of different devices vary considerably from each other. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new DL method to cope with Byzantine attacks based on coded robust aggregation (CRA-DL). Before training begins, the training data are allocated to the devices redundantly. During training, in each iteration, the honest devices transmit coded gradients to the server computed from the allocated training data, and the server then aggregates the information received from both honest and Byzantine devices using RBA rules. In this way, the global gradient can be approximately recovered at the server to update the global model. Compared with current DL methods applying RBA rules, the improvement of CRA-DL is attributed to the fact that the coded gradients sent by the honest devices are closer to each other. This closeness enhances the robustness of the aggregation against Byzantine attacks, since Byzantine messages tend to be significantly different from those of honest devices in this case. We theoretically analyze the convergence performance of CRA-DL. Finally, we present numerical results to verify the superiority of the proposed method over existing baselines, showing its enhanced learning performance under Byzantine attacks.

<div> Keywords: ensemble clustering, generalization error, excess risk, consistency, algorithm development

Summary:
Ensemble clustering, a successful approach in practice, is analyzed in this paper with a focus on its theoretical foundations. The study examines generalization performance, deriving bounds for generalization error and excess risk. The research shows that ensemble clustering is consistent when both the number of base clusterings and samples approach infinity. However, since practical scenarios involve finite values for these parameters, the generalization error cannot be reduced to zero. To improve clustering performance, it is crucial to minimize bias in base clustering and maximize diversity among base clusterings. Maximal diversity can be achieved through a robust optimization model. A new ensemble clustering algorithm developed based on the theoretical findings outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various datasets in terms of NMI, ARI, and purity metrics. The code for the algorithm is available on GitHub at https://github.com/xuz2019/GPEC.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble clustering has demonstrated great success in practice; however, its theoretical foundations remain underexplored. This paper examines the generalization performance of ensemble clustering, focusing on generalization error, excess risk and consistency. We derive a convergence rate of generalization error bound and excess risk bound both of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{m}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$, with $n$ and $m$ being the numbers of samples and base clusterings. Based on this, we prove that when $m$ and $n$ approach infinity and $m$ is significantly larger than log $n$, i.e., $m,n\to \infty, m\gg \log n$, ensemble clustering is consistent. Furthermore, recognizing that $n$ and $m$ are finite in practice, the generalization error cannot be reduced to zero. Thus, by assigning varying weights to finite clusterings, we minimize the error between the empirical average clusterings and their expectation. From this, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve better clustering performance, we should minimize the deviation (bias) of base clustering from its expectation and maximize the differences (diversity) among various base clusterings. Additionally, we derive that maximizing diversity is nearly equivalent to a robust (min-max) optimization model. Finally, we instantiate our theory to develop a new ensemble clustering algorithm. Compared with SOTA methods, our approach achieves average improvements of 6.1%, 7.3%, and 6.0% on 10 datasets w.r.t. NMI, ARI, and Purity. The code is available at https://github.com/xuz2019/GPEC.

Abstract: Introduction: Personal identification is a critical aspect of forensic sciences, security, and healthcare. While conventional biometrics systems such as DNA profiling and iris scanning offer high accuracy, they are time-consuming and costly. Objectives: This study investigates the relationship between fingerprint patterns and ABO blood group classification to explore potential correlations between these two traits. Methods: The study analyzed 200 individuals, categorizing their fingerprints into three types: loops, whorls, and arches. Blood group classification was also recorded. Statistical analysis, including chi-square and Pearson correlation tests, was used to assess associations between fingerprint patterns and blood groups. Results: Loops were the most common fingerprint pattern, while blood group O+ was the most prevalent among the participants. Statistical analysis revealed no significant correlation between fingerprint patterns and blood groups (p > 0.05), suggesting that these traits are independent. Conclusions: Although the study showed limited correlation between fingerprint patterns and ABO blood groups, it highlights the importance of future research using larger and more diverse populations, incorporating machine learning approaches, and integrating multiple biometric signals. This study contributes to forensic science by emphasizing the need for rigorous protocols and comprehensive investigations in personal identification.

Abstract: The ability to learn and retain a wide variety of tasks is a hallmark of human intelligence that has inspired research in artificial general intelligence. Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards achieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context switching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic forgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned task when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task contexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the interference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper introduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context switching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an additional network that generates the weights of the primary network dynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is input-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer vision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of previously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient Descent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding dynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in enabling continual learning for improved performance.

<div> Decomposing weight matrices, quantization, low-rank components, compression, language models 

Summary: 
Decomposing weight matrices into quantization and low-rank components is a common method for compressing large language models. Existing optimization methods often prioritize one component over the other, leading to suboptimal decompositions. The Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI) technique introduced in this work assigns low-rank components the task of capturing activation-sensitive weights, improving the balance between quantization and low-rank approximation. Experiments on various large language models show that incorporating ODLRI reduces activation-aware error, minimizes quantization scale, and enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy in low-bit settings. <div>

Abstract: Decomposing weight matrices into quantization and low-rank components ($\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$) is a widely used technique for compressing large language models (LLMs). Existing joint optimization methods iteratively alternate between quantization and low-rank approximation. However, these methods tend to prioritize one component at the expense of the other, resulting in suboptimal decompositions that fail to leverage each component's unique strengths. In this work, we introduce Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI), which assigns low-rank components the specific role of capturing activation-sensitive weights. This structured decomposition mitigates outliers' negative impact on quantization, enabling more effective balance between quantization and low-rank approximation. Experiments on Llama2 (7B, 13B, 70B), Llama3-8B, and Mistral-7B demonstrate that incorporating ODLRI into the joint optimization framework consistently reduces activation-aware error, minimizes quantization scale, and improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy in low-bit settings.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces a two-stage optimization framework, MaskedOptim, to address label noise issues in federated learning. The first stage focuses on detecting noisy clients with higher label noise rates, while the second stage aims to rectify the labels of these clients' data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism. This approach helps mitigate the negative effects of misinformation in datasets by learning potential ground-truth labels via backpropagation. Additionally, the use of geometric median based model aggregation enhances training robustness. The framework is evaluated on multiple datasets with varying label noise patterns, showing robustness in different scenarios and enhancing data quality for noisy clients. The codes for the framework will be open-sourced to benefit the research community. <div>

Abstract: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has made significant advance in privacy-sensitive applications. However, it can be hard to ensure that FL participants provide well-annotated data for training. The corresponding annotations from different clients often contain complex label noise at varying levels. This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of the trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely attributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an effective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy clients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework, MaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem. The first stage is designed to facilitate the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise rates. The second stage focuses on rectifying the labels of the noisy clients' data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism, aiming to mitigate the negative impacts caused by misinformation within datasets. This is achieved by learning the potential ground-truth labels of the noisy clients' datasets via backpropagation. To further enhance the training robustness, we apply the geometric median based model aggregation instead of the commonly-used vanilla averaged model aggregation. We implement sixteen related methods and conduct evaluations on three image datasets and one text dataset with diverse label noise patterns for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed framework shows its robustness in different scenarios. Additionally, our label correction framework effectively enhances the data quality of the detected noisy clients' local datasets. % Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related research communities.

Summary: 
- The study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for time series foundation models applied to anomaly detection, inspired by their success in natural language processing tasks.
- Test-time adaptation through example-based prompting is common in LLM-based approaches due to the high retraining cost, but existing time series foundation models lack the ability to interpret or use examples.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, recent research has explored the building of time series foundation models and applied them to tasks such as forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<div> Keywords: Causal Discovery, Temporal Data, Simulation, AutoML, Realistic Data Generation

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework called Temporal Causal-based Simulation (TCS) for generating realistic time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The framework consists of three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure, approximating functional dependencies, and learning the noise distribution of the causal model. The authors highlight the challenges of discriminating between real, semi-synthetic, and purely synthetic datasets and propose a Min-max optimization phase using AutoML techniques. The research emphasizes the complexity of sampling realistic causal data and demonstrates the effectiveness of the TCS method in generating sensible causal-based temporal data through experiments with various datasets. The study contributes a flexible, model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic data and provides insights into the challenges of realistic data generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal Discovery plays a pivotal role in revealing relationships among observed variables, particularly in the temporal setup. While the majority of CD methods rely on synthetic data for evaluation, and recently for training, these fall short in accurately mirroring real-world scenarios; an effect even more evident in temporal data. Generation techniques depending on simplified assumptions on causal structure, effects and time, limit the quality and diversity of the simulated data. In this work, we introduce Temporal Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a robust framework for generating realistic time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The approach is structured in three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure of the data, approximating the functional dependencies between variables and learning the noise distribution of the corresponding causal model, each part of which can be explicitly tailored based on data assumptions and characteristics. Through an extensive evaluation process, we highlight that single detection methods for generated data discrimination prove inadequate, accentuating it as a multifaceted challenge. For this, we detail a Min-max optimization phase that draws on AutoML techniques. Our contributions include a flexible, model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic temporal causal data, a thorough evaluation setup which enhances the validity of the generated datasets and insights into the challenges posed by realistic data generation. Through experiments involving not only real but also semi-synthetic and purely synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that while sampling realistic causal data remains a complex task, our method enriches the domain of generating sensible causal-based temporal data.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Learnable Concept-Based Model (LCBM) for image classification, focusing on improving the trustworthiness and interpretability of deep neural networks. LCBM models concepts as random variables in a Bernoulli latent space, requiring less human supervision and maintaining scalability. It outperforms existing unsupervised concept-based models in generalization capability and approaches the performance of black-box models. The concept representation enhances information retention and is more intuitive for humans to interpret, as shown in a user study. Despite using concept embeddings, the model remains interpretable through a local linear combination of concepts. This approach addresses the critical need for better understanding of decision-making processes in deep neural networks. <div>

Abstract: To increase the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, it is critical to improve the understanding of how they make decisions. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised concept-based model for image classification, named Learnable Concept-Based Model (LCBM) which models concepts as random variables within a Bernoulli latent space. Unlike traditional methods that either require extensive human supervision or suffer from limited scalability, our approach employs a reduced number of concepts without sacrificing performance. We demonstrate that LCBM surpasses existing unsupervised concept-based models in generalization capability and nearly matches the performance of black-box models. The proposed concept representation enhances information retention and aligns more closely with human understanding. A user study demonstrates the discovered concepts are also more intuitive for humans to interpret. Finally, despite the use of concept embeddings, we maintain model interpretability by means of a local linear combination of concepts.

Their experiments on the MMK12 dataset show that SynthRL synthesizes over 3.3K additional verifiable, challenging questions.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have shown notable progress in scaling test-time compute effectively. In this work, we investigate how synthesized RL data can further improve RLVR. To this end, we propose \textbf{SynthRL}-a scalable and guaranteed pipeline for automatic data scaling in reasoning-oriented RL training. SynthRL comprises three key stages: (1) selecting seed questions with appropriate distribution, (2) augmenting them into more challenging variants while preserving the original answers, and (3) a guaranteed verification stage that ensures near-perfect correctness and difficulty enhancement. Our empirical experiments demonstrate SynthRL's scalability and effectiveness. When applied to the MMK12 dataset, SynthRL synthesizes over 3.3K additional verifiable, challenging questions from approximately 8K seed samples. Models trained with our synthesized data achieve consistent gains across five out-of-domain visual math reasoning benchmarks, with a significant improvement over baseline models trained on seed data alone. Notably, detailed analysis reveals that the gains are more pronounced on the most challenging evaluation samples, highlighting SynthRL's effectiveness in eliciting deeper and more complex reasoning patterns.

Summary: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective but operate as black-box models, limiting their application in sensitive areas like healthcare. Explainability methods provide feature-level explanations but pose privacy risks when combined with auxiliary information.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance across many applications but function as black-box models, limiting their use in critical domains like healthcare and criminal justice. Explainability methods address this by providing feature-level explanations that identify important node attributes for predictions. These explanations create privacy risks. Combined with auxiliary information, feature explanations can enable adversaries to reconstruct graph structure, exposing sensitive relationships. Existing graph reconstruction attacks assume access to original auxiliary data, but practical systems use differential privacy to protect node features and labels while providing explanations for transparency. We study a threat model where adversaries access public feature explanations along with privatized node features and labels. We show that existing explanation-based attacks like GSEF perform poorly with privatized data due to noise from differential privacy mechanisms. We propose ReconXF, a graph reconstruction attack for scenarios with public explanations and privatized auxiliary data. Our method adapts explanation-based frameworks by incorporating denoising mechanisms that handle differential privacy noise while exploiting structural signals in explanations. Experiments across multiple datasets show ReconXF outperforms SoTA methods in privatized settings, with improvements in AUC and average precision. Results indicate that public explanations combined with denoising enable graph structure recovery even under the privacy protection of auxiliary data. Code is available at (link to be made public after acceptance).

Summary:
The article introduces a new method for enhancing the explainability of Transformers in deep learning research. It addresses the limitations of existing Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) methods for Transformers by incorporating positional encoding (PE) into the explanation process. The reformulation of the input space as position-token pairs enables the propagation of attributions across various PE methods such as Rotary, Learnable, and Absolute PE. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in both vision and NLP explainability tasks. The method is tested on fine-tuned classifiers and zero-shot foundation models like LLaMA 3. The code for the method is publicly available for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: The development of effective explainability tools for Transformers is a crucial pursuit in deep learning research. One of the most promising approaches in this domain is Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which propagates relevance scores backward through the network to the input space by redistributing activation values based on predefined rules. However, existing LRP-based methods for Transformer explainability entirely overlook a critical component of the Transformer architecture: its positional encoding (PE), resulting in violation of the conservation property, and the loss of an important and unique type of relevance, which is also associated with structural and positional features. To address this limitation, we reformulate the input space for Transformer explainability as a set of position-token pairs. This allows us to propose specialized theoretically-grounded LRP rules designed to propagate attributions across various positional encoding methods, including Rotary, Learnable, and Absolute PE. Extensive experiments with both fine-tuned classifiers and zero-shot foundation models, such as LLaMA 3, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in both vision and NLP explainability tasks. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: A central problem in machine learning is often formulated as follows: Given a dataset $\{(x_j, y_j)\}_{j=1}^M$, which is a sample drawn from an unknown probability distribution, the goal is to construct a functional model $f$ such that $f(x) \approx y$ for any $(x, y)$ drawn from the same distribution. Neural networks and kernel-based methods are commonly employed for this task due to their capacity for fast and parallel computation. The approximation capabilities, or expressive power, of these methods have been extensively studied over the past 35 years. In this paper, we will present examples of key ideas in this area found in the literature. We will discuss emerging trends in machine learning including the role of shallow/deep networks, approximation on manifolds, physics-informed neural surrogates, neural operators, and transformer architectures. Despite function approximation being a fundamental problem in machine learning, approximation theory does not play a central role in the theoretical foundations of the field. One unfortunate consequence of this disconnect is that it is often unclear how well trained models will generalize to unseen or unlabeled data. In this review, we examine some of the shortcomings of the current machine learning framework and explore the reasons for the gap between approximation theory and machine learning practice. We will then introduce our novel research to achieve function approximation on unknown manifolds without the need to learn specific manifold features, such as the eigen-decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator or atlas construction. In many machine learning problems, particularly classification tasks, the labels $y_j$ are drawn from a finite set of values.

<div> Instrumental variable estimation, endogenous variables, high-dimensional treatment, representation learning, omitted variable bias<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Traditional instrumental variable estimators are limited in accommodating multiple endogenous treatment variables when faced with high-dimensional and unstructured treatments. In such cases, researchers often use dimension reduction techniques before applying IV regression, leading to potential omitted variable bias. A new approach proposed in this study incorporates instrumental variables directly into the treatment representation learning process, allowing for better handling of high-dimensional endogenous variables with limited instruments. The method ensures identification of directions optimizing outcome prediction, improving upon conventional two-stage approaches that do not incorporate instrument information. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in overcoming the limitations of traditional IV estimation in high-dimensional settings. <div>

Abstract: Traditional instrumental variable (IV) estimators face a fundamental constraint: they can only accommodate as many endogenous treatment variables as available instruments. This limitation becomes particularly challenging in settings where the treatment is presented in a high-dimensional and unstructured manner (e.g. descriptions of patient treatment pathways in a hospital). In such settings, researchers typically resort to applying unsupervised dimension reduction techniques to learn a low-dimensional treatment representation prior to implementing IV regression analysis. We show that such methods can suffer from substantial omitted variable bias due to implicit regularization in the representation learning step. We propose a novel approach to construct treatment representations by explicitly incorporating instrumental variables during the representation learning process. Our approach provides a framework for handling high-dimensional endogenous variables with limited instruments. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that fitting IV models on these instrument-informed representations ensures identification of directions that optimize outcome prediction. Our experiments show that our proposed methodology improves upon the conventional two-stage approaches that perform dimension reduction without incorporating instrument information.

<div> Sliced Wasserstein distances, High-dimensional probability measures, Constrained learning, Optimization, Primal-dual approach

Summary:
The article introduces a constrained learning approach for optimizing slicing directions in Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances, which allow efficient comparison of high-dimensional probability measures by projecting them onto 1-dimensional distributions. The approach constrains the 1D transport plans to approximate the optimal plan in the original space, ensuring meaningful slicing directions and reducing computational complexity. By using continuous relaxations of transport plans, a gradient-based primal-dual approach is employed to train slicer parameters and other model parameters simultaneously. This constrained slicing approach is demonstrated to be effective in pooling high-dimensional embeddings into fixed-length permutation-invariant representations across various types of data such as images, point clouds, and protein sequences. Numerical results show improved performance in learning informative slicing directions. The implementation code for the method is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances offer an efficient method for comparing high-dimensional probability measures by projecting them onto multiple 1-dimensional probability distributions. However, identifying informative slicing directions has proven challenging, often necessitating a large number of slices to achieve desirable performance and thereby increasing computational complexity. We introduce a constrained learning approach to optimize the slicing directions for SW distances. Specifically, we constrain the 1D transport plans to approximate the optimal plan in the original space, ensuring meaningful slicing directions. By leveraging continuous relaxations of these transport plans, we enable a gradient-based primal-dual approach to train the slicer parameters, alongside the remaining model parameters. We demonstrate how this constrained slicing approach can be applied to pool high-dimensional embeddings into fixed-length permutation-invariant representations. Numerical results on foundation models trained on images, point clouds, and protein sequences showcase the efficacy of the proposed constrained learning approach in learning more informative slicing directions.

Summary: 
The article introduces Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM) as an enhancement to the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). It addresses the issue of premature convergence in multimodal landscapes by leveraging Bregman centroids for information aggregation and diversity control. $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted centroid across CEM workers and updates underperforming ones by sampling within a trust region around the centroid. By integrating seamlessly into CEM pipelines with minimal overhead, $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ improves both convergence and solution quality. The effectiveness of $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ is demonstrated through empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, a cluttered navigation task, and complete MBRL pipelines. This enhancement offers a simple yet impactful upgrade for CEM in optimizing trajectories for reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for principled information aggregation and diversity control. $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.

Summary:
KDRL is a unified post-training framework that combines reinforcement learning and knowledge distillation to optimize reasoning models. It addresses the limitations of traditional RL and KD methods by leveraging policy gradient optimization to minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between student and teacher distributions while maximizing rule-based rewards. By integrating KD and RL, KDRL achieves better performance and reasoning token efficiency on multiple benchmarks compared to existing methods. This approach offers a balanced strategy for training reasoning LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of jointly optimizing through teacher supervision and self-exploration. <div>
arXiv:2506.02208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) post-training have leveraged two distinct paradigms to enhance reasoning capabilities: reinforcement learning (RL) and knowledge distillation (KD). While RL enables the emergence of complex reasoning behaviors, it often suffers from low sample efficiency when the initial policy struggles to explore high-reward trajectories. Conversely, KD improves learning efficiency via mimicking the teacher model but tends to generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we present \textbf{KDRL}, a \textit{unified post-training framework} that jointly optimizes a reasoning model through teacher supervision (KD) and self-exploration (RL). Specifically, KDRL leverages policy gradient optimization to simultaneously minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL) between the student and teacher distributions while maximizing the expected rule-based rewards. We first formulate a unified objective that integrates GRPO and KD, and systematically explore how different KL approximations, KL coefficients, and reward-guided KD strategies affect the overall post-training dynamics and performance. Empirical results on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KDRL outperforms GRPO and various KD baselines while achieving a favorable balance between performance and reasoning token efficiency. These findings indicate that integrating KD and RL serves as an effective and efficient strategy to train reasoning LLMs.

<div> symmetry, redundancy, neural networks, dynamic pruning, efficiency <br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces a new dynamic pruning algorithm called ExPrune that targets redundancy induced by symmetry in neural networks. By leveraging the statistical property of exchangeability, ExPrune identifies and removes overlapping information in NN computation on a per-input basis. The algorithm dynamically prunes neurons by predicting negative inputs to ReLU activations. Evaluation on computer vision, graph, and language models shows that ExPrune achieves significant reductions in FLOPs while maintaining accuracy, with reductions ranging from 10.98% to 39.05% without accuracy drop and up to 14.39% with a maximum 1% accuracy drop. ExPrune also demonstrates compatibility with static pruning, providing additional FLOPs reduction on aggressively pruned models. Overall, ExPrune offers a principled approach to improving the efficiency of neural networks through symmetry-based redundancy removal. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) are equipped with increasingly many parameters and require more and more resource for deployment. Researchers have explored various ways to improve the efficiency of NNs by identifying and reducing the redundancy, such as pruning or quantizing unimportant weights. Symmetry in the NN architectures has been identified by prior work as a possible type of redundancy, but exploiting it for efficient inference is not yet explored. In this work, we formalize the symmetry of parameters and intermediate values in NNs using the statistical property of exchangeablility. We identify that exchangeable values in NN computation may contain overlapping information, leading to redundancy. Exploiting the insight, we derive a principled general dynamic pruning algorithm ExPrune to remove symmetry-induced redundancy on a per-input basis. We also provide an instantiation of ExPrune that performs neuron-level dynamic pruning by predicting negative inputs to ReLU activations. We evaluate ExPrune on two computer vision models, one graph model and one language model. ExPrune provides 10.98--26.3% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and 21.01--39.05% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop. We also demonstrate that ExPrune composes with static pruning. On models that have been aggressively pruned statically, ExPrune provides additional 10.24--11.11% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and 13.91--14.39% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop.

Abstract: Learning on small data is a challenge frequently encountered in many real-world applications. In this work we study how effective quantum ensemble models are when trained on small data problems in healthcare and life sciences. We constructed multiple types of quantum ensembles for binary classification using up to 26 qubits in simulation and 56 qubits on quantum hardware. Our ensemble designs use minimal trainable parameters but require long-range connections between qubits. We tested these quantum ensembles on synthetic datasets and gene expression data from renal cell carcinoma patients with the task of predicting patient response to immunotherapy. From the performance observed in simulation and initial hardware experiments, we demonstrate how quantum embedding structure affects performance and discuss how to extract informative features and build models that can learn and generalize effectively. We present these exploratory results in order to assist other researchers in the design of effective learning on small data using ensembles. Incorporating quantum computing in these data constrained problems offers hope for a wide range of studies in healthcare and life sciences where biological samples are relatively scarce given the feature space to be explored.

Summary: 
Urban and transportation research aims to uncover relationships between variables and societal outcomes like road safety. Traditional workflows face challenges of human bias, interpretability issues in deep learning, and underutilization of unstructured data. To address these, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approach is proposed for automated hypothesis generation and evaluation related to urban context and road safety. The method crafts safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extracts interpretable embeddings, and applies them in statistical models for hypothesis testing and refinement. Experimental evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate the approach's superiority over pretrained deep learning models while providing full interpretability. UrbanX can be used for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from unstructured urban data and enhancing model trustworthiness for policy applications.

Abstract: Urban and transportation research has long sought to uncover statistically meaningful relationships between key variables and societal outcomes such as road safety, to generate actionable insights that guide the planning, development, and renewal of urban and transportation systems. However, traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference, enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.

Abstract: Tabular and relational data remain the most ubiquitous formats in real-world machine learning applications, spanning domains from finance to healthcare. Although both formats offer structured representations, they pose distinct challenges for modern deep learning methods, which typically assume flat, feature-aligned inputs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising solution by capturing structural dependencies within and between tables. However, existing GNN-based approaches often rely on rigid, schema-derived graphs -- such as those based on primary-foreign key links -- thereby underutilizing rich, predictive signals in non key attributes. In this work, we introduce auGraph, a unified framework for task-aware graph augmentation that applies to both tabular and relational data. auGraph enhances base graph structures by selectively promoting attributes into nodes, guided by scoring functions that quantify their relevance to the downstream prediction task. This augmentation preserves the original data schema while injecting task-relevant structural signal. Empirically, auGraph outperforms schema-based and heuristic graph construction methods by producing graphs that better support learning for relational and tabular prediction tasks.

<br />Summary:
The study introduces Human Heterogeneity Invariant Stress Sensing (HHISS), a domain generalization approach for stress detection using wearable devices. HHISS focuses on finding consistent stress patterns by removing person-specific differences, improving model performance across different individuals, environments, and stress types. A novel technique called person-wise sub-network pruning intersection is utilized to identify shared features among individuals and prevent overfitting while training with continuous labels. The study specifically targets individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), where stress responses can vary significantly based on medication timing, potentially impacting rehabilitation and recovery. Testing across seven diverse stress datasets demonstrates HHISS consistently outperforms existing methods, proving effective for real-world applications. Ablation studies, empirical justifications, and runtime evaluations confirm the feasibility and scalability of HHISS for mobile stress sensing in sensitive real-world scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Stress affects physical and mental health, and wearable devices have been widely used to detect daily stress through physiological signals. However, these signals vary due to factors such as individual differences and health conditions, making generalizing machine learning models difficult. To address these challenges, we present Human Heterogeneity Invariant Stress Sensing (HHISS), a domain generalization approach designed to find consistent patterns in stress signals by removing person-specific differences. This helps the model perform more accurately across new people, environments, and stress types not seen during training. Its novelty lies in proposing a novel technique called person-wise sub-network pruning intersection to focus on shared features across individuals, alongside preventing overfitting by leveraging continuous labels while training. The study focuses especially on people with opioid use disorder (OUD)-a group where stress responses can change dramatically depending on their time of daily medication taking. Since stress often triggers cravings, a model that can adapt well to these changes could support better OUD rehabilitation and recovery. We tested HHISS on seven different stress datasets-four of which we collected ourselves and three public ones. Four are from lab setups, one from a controlled real-world setting, driving, and two are from real-world in-the-wild field datasets without any constraints. This is the first study to evaluate how well a stress detection model works across such a wide range of data. Results show HHISS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baseline methods, proving both effective and practical for real-world use. Ablation studies, empirical justifications, and runtime evaluations confirm HHISS's feasibility and scalability for mobile stress sensing in sensitive real-world applications.

<div> Keywords: equivariant neural networks, optimization, symmetries, hyperparameter tuning, loss landscape geometry<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Equivariant neural networks are effective for tasks with known symmetries, but optimizing them can be challenging. This study investigates whether equivariance constraints hinder optimization or just require different tuning. The analysis focuses on networks using permutation representations within the context of unconstrained MLPs. It is shown that the parameter symmetries of the unconstrained model can impact the loss landscape of the equivariant subspace, potentially preventing learning of global minima. Relaxing to an unconstrained MLP can sometimes resolve this issue, leading to different weight configurations corresponding to alternative group representations. The study highlights three key points: (1) Viewing networks within a larger function space can provide insights into the loss landscape structure. (2) Equivariant networks in the unconstrained space form a complex union of linear hyperplanes based on internal group representations. (3) Effective relaxation of equivariance may involve adding non-equivariant degrees of freedom and reconsidering group representations in hidden layers. <div>
arXiv:2506.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective for tasks with known underlying symmetries. However, optimizing equivariant networks can be tricky and best training practices are less established than for standard networks. In particular, recent works have found small training benefits from relaxing equivariance constraints. This raises the question: do equivariance constraints introduce fundamental obstacles to optimization? Or do they simply require different hyperparameter tuning? In this work, we investigate this question through a theoretical analysis of the loss landscape geometry. We focus on networks built using permutation representations, which we can view as a subset of unconstrained MLPs. Importantly, we show that the parameter symmetries of the unconstrained model has nontrivial effects on the loss landscape of the equivariant subspace and under certain conditions can provably prevent learning of the global minima. Further, we empirically demonstrate in such cases, relaxing to an unconstrained MLP can sometimes solve the issue. Interestingly, the weights eventually found via relaxation corresponds to a different choice of group representation in the hidden layer. From this, we draw 3 key takeaways. (1) Viewing any class of networks in the context of larger unconstrained function space can give important insights on loss landscape structure. (2) Within the unconstrained function space, equivariant networks form a complicated union of linear hyperplanes, each associated with a specific choice of internal group representation. (3) Effective relaxation of equivariance may require not only adding nonequivariant degrees of freedom, but also rethinking the fixed choice of group representations in hidden layers.

Summary: <br />
Stochastic Interpolants (SI) offer a powerful framework for generative modeling by transforming between two probability distributions. However, their application in latent variable models has been limited due to the need for direct access to samples from the distributions. The introduction of Latent Stochastic Interpolants (LSI) enables joint learning in a latent space with optimized encoder, decoder, and latent SI models. By deriving a principled Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective in continuous time, LSI learns effective latent representations and a generative process that transforms an arbitrary prior distribution into the aggregated posterior defined by the encoder. LSI overcomes the limitations of simple priors in normal diffusion models and reduces computational demands in high-dimensional observation spaces while maintaining the generative flexibility of the SI framework. Experimental results on ImageNet generation demonstrate the efficacy of LSI. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Stochastic Interpolants (SI) are a powerful framework for generative modeling, capable of flexibly transforming between two probability distributions. However, their use in jointly optimized latent variable models remains unexplored as they require direct access to the samples from the two distributions. This work presents Latent Stochastic Interpolants (LSI) enabling joint learning in a latent space with end-to-end optimized encoder, decoder and latent SI models. We achieve this by developing a principled Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective derived directly in continuous time. The joint optimization allows LSI to learn effective latent representations along with a generative process that transforms an arbitrary prior distribution into the encoder-defined aggregated posterior. LSI sidesteps the simple priors of the normal diffusion models and mitigates the computational demands of applying SI directly in high-dimensional observation spaces, while preserving the generative flexibility of the SI framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of LSI through comprehensive experiments on the standard large scale ImageNet generation benchmark.

Summary: 
The paper introduces GAIN-RL, a Gradient-driven Angle-Informed Navigated RL framework designed to improve the training efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging the model's intrinsic angle concentration signal. By dynamically selecting training data based on this signal, GAIN-RL significantly accelerates the training process, achieving over a 2.5x speedup across various tasks and model scales. Additionally, GAIN-RL demonstrates data-efficient training, outperforming vanilla GRPO with only half the original data. This approach addresses the sample inefficiency issues in current Reinforcement Fine-tuning paradigms by optimizing gradient updates through model-informed data selection. The empirical evaluations underscore the effectiveness of GAIN-RL in enhancing training efficiency and performance of LLMs, making it a promising framework for future research in reinforcement learning and language modeling.

arXiv:2506.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from sample inefficiency due to the redundant exposure of identical queries under uniform data sampling. While previous work has explored curriculum learning via heuristic difficulty metrics, these strategies exhibit limitations by neglecting the intrinsic learning signals generated by the model itself, thus leading to suboptimal training regimes. In this paper, we identify a model-inherent signal termed angle concentration that effectively reflects an LLM's capacity to learn from specific data. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate a correlation between the angular distribution of token hidden state vectors and the resulting gradient, revealing a learning preference for data exhibiting higher angle concentration. Inspired by this finding, we propose GAIN-RL, a Gradient-driven Angle-Informed Navigated RL framework. By leveraging the model's intrinsic angle concentration signal, GAIN-RL dynamically selects training data in each epoch, ensuring consistently impactful gradient updates and thus significantly enhancing overall training efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that GAIN-RL (GRPO) achieves over a 2.5x acceleration in training efficiency across diverse mathematical and coding tasks and varying model scales. Furthermore, GAIN-RL (GRPO)'s efficient sampling yields data-efficient training, achieving better performance with half the original data compared to vanilla GRPO with full training data.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, gradient norm, weight decay, normalization layers, learning rate schedule 

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) undergoing extended training experience a rapid increase in gradient norm towards the end of training. This phenomenon is attributed to an unintended interplay between weight decay, normalization layers, and the learning rate schedule. To address this issue, a straightforward correction is proposed, rectifying the anomalous behavior and concurrently yielding reduced loss values throughout the training process. By mitigating the adverse effects caused by these factors, the proposed solution ensures a smoother and more stable training experience for LLMs, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: During long-duration Large Language Model (LLM) training runs the gradient norm increases rapidly near the end of training. In this short note, we show that this increase is due to an unintended interaction between weight decay, normalization layers, and the learning rate schedule. We propose a simple correction that fixes this behavior while also resulting in lower loss values throughout training.

<div> Equivariant neural networks, symmetry, separation power, universality, approximation ability<br />
<br />
Summary: 
Equivariant neural networks are analyzed for their separation power and approximation ability when incorporating symmetry into learning architectures. While separation power focuses on distinguishing inputs modulo symmetry, the universality of equivariant models in approximating target functions is explored in this work. It is found that separation power does not fully capture expressivity, as models with the same separation power may differ in approximation ability. The universality classes of shallow invariant networks are characterized, revealing conditions under which shallow equivariant networks may not be universal. Structural properties of the symmetry group, such as the existence of proper subgroups, play a crucial role in determining when shallow models can achieve universality. Positive results are identified in certain settings, but challenges remain in cases like permutation symmetry where necessary conditions may not hold. <div>

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks provide a principled framework for incorporating symmetry into learning architectures and have been extensively analyzed through the lens of their separation power, that is, the ability to distinguish inputs modulo symmetry. This notion plays a central role in settings such as graph learning, where it is often formalized via the Weisfeiler-Leman hierarchy. In contrast, the universality of equivariant models-their capacity to approximate target functions-remains comparatively underexplored. In this work, we investigate the approximation power of equivariant neural networks beyond separation constraints. We show that separation power does not fully capture expressivity: models with identical separation power may differ in their approximation ability. To demonstrate this, we characterize the universality classes of shallow invariant networks, providing a general framework for understanding which functions these architectures can approximate. Since equivariant models reduce to invariant ones under projection, this analysis yields sufficient conditions under which shallow equivariant networks fail to be universal. Conversely, we identify settings where shallow models do achieve separation-constrained universality. These positive results, however, depend critically on structural properties of the symmetry group, such as the existence of adequate normal subgroups, which may not hold in important cases like permutation symmetry.

<title>Through a Steerable Lens: Magnifying Neural Network Interpretability via Phase-Based Extrapolation</title>

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations and decision mechanisms of deep neural networks remains a critical open challenge. While existing interpretability methods often identify influential input regions, they may not elucidate how a model distinguishes between classes or what specific changes would transition an input from one category to another. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that visualizes the implicit path between classes by treating the network gradient as a form of infinitesimal motion. Drawing inspiration from phase-based motion magnification, we first decompose images using invertible transforms-specifically the Complex Steerable Pyramid-then compute class-conditional gradients in the transformed space. Rather than iteratively integrating the gradient to trace a full path, we amplify the one-step gradient to the input and perform a linear extrapolation to expose how the model moves from source to target class. By operating in the steerable pyramid domain, these amplified gradients produce semantically meaningful, spatially coherent morphs that highlight the classifier's most sensitive directions, giving insight into the geometry of its decision boundaries. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our phase-focused extrapolation yields perceptually aligned, semantically meaningful transformations, offering a novel, interpretable lens into neural classifiers' internal representations.

Abstract: We present CACTI, a masked autoencoding approach for imputing tabular data that leverages the structure in missingness patterns and contextual information. Our approach employs a novel median truncated copy masking training strategy that encourages the model to learn from empirical patterns of missingness while incorporating semantic relationships between features - captured by column names and text descriptions - to better represent feature dependence. These dual sources of inductive bias enable CACTI to outperform state-of-the-art methods - an average $R^2$ gain of 7.8% over the next best method (13.4%, 6.1%, and 5.3% under missing not at random, at random and completely at random, respectively) - across a diverse range of datasets and missingness conditions. Our results highlight the value of leveraging dataset-specific contextual information and missingness patterns to enhance imputation performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks. These breakthroughs are largely driven by new pre-training paradigms that leverage large-scale, unlabeled multimodal data, followed by instruction fine-tuning on curated labeled datasets and high-quality prompts. While there is growing interest in scaling instruction fine-tuning to ever-larger datasets in both quantity and scale, our findings reveal that simply increasing the number of instruction-tuning tasks does not consistently yield better performance. Instead, we observe that grouping tasks by the common interactions across modalities, such as discovering redundant shared information, prioritizing modality selection with unique information, or requiring synergistic fusion to discover new information from both modalities, encourages the models to learn transferrable skills within a group while suppressing interference from mismatched tasks. To this end, we introduce MINT, a simple yet surprisingly effective task-grouping strategy based on the type of multimodal interaction. We demonstrate that the proposed method greatly outperforms existing task grouping baselines for multimodal instruction tuning, striking an effective balance between generalization and specialization.

<title>A Data-Based Architecture for Flight Test without Test Points</title>

Abstract: The justification for the "test point" derives from the test pilot's obligation to reproduce faithfully the pre-specified conditions of some model prediction. Pilot deviation from those conditions invalidates the model assumptions. Flight test aids have been proposed to increase accuracy on more challenging test points. However, the very existence of databands and tolerances is the problem more fundamental than inadequate pilot skill. We propose a novel approach, which eliminates test points. We start with a high-fidelity digital model of an air vehicle. Instead of using this model to generate a point prediction, we use a machine learning method to produce a reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM has two important properties. First, it can generate a prediction based on any set of conditions the pilot flies. Second, if the test result at those conditions differ from the prediction, the ROM can be updated using the new data. The outcome of flight test is thus a refined ROM at whatever conditions were flown. This ROM in turn updates and validates the high-fidelity model. We present a single example of this "point-less" architecture, using T-38C flight test data. We first use a generic aircraft model to build a ROM of longitudinal pitching motion as a hypersurface. We then ingest unconstrained flight test data and use Gaussian Process Regression to update and condition the hypersurface. By proposing a second-order equivalent system for the T-38C, this hypersurface then generates parameters necessary to assess MIL-STD-1797B compliance for longitudinal dynamics.

Abstract: Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably, convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization that removes the need of early-stopping.

Abstract: We formulate an optimization problem to estimate probability densities in the context of multidimensional problems that are sampled with uneven probability. It considers detector sensitivity as an heterogeneous density and takes advantage of the computational speed and flexible boundary conditions offered by splines on a grid. We choose to regularize the Hessian of the spline via the nuclear norm to promote sparsity. As a result, the method is spatially adaptive and stable against the choice of the regularization parameter, which plays the role of the bandwidth. We test our computational pipeline on standard densities and provide software. We also present a new approach to PET rebinning as an application of our framework.

Abstract: Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps enable the coupling of multiphysics simulations across computational subdomains by ensuring continuity of state variables and fluxes at artificial interfaces. We present a novel method for learning Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on graphs using Gaussian processes, specifically for problems where the data obey a conservation constraint from an underlying partial differential equation. Our approach combines discrete exterior calculus and nonlinear optimal recovery to infer relationships between vertex and edge values. This framework yields data-driven predictions with uncertainty quantification across the entire graph, even when observations are limited to a subset of vertices and edges. By optimizing over the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm while applying a maximum likelihood estimation penalty on kernel complexity, our method ensures that the resulting surrogate strictly enforces conservation laws without overfitting. We demonstrate our method on two representative applications: subsurface fracture networks and arterial blood flow. Our results show that the method maintains high accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates even under severe data scarcity, highlighting its potential for scientific applications where limited data and reliable uncertainty quantification are critical.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective framework for training large language models on structured language-conditioned tasks. We identify a critical flaw of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a widely used RL algorithm in this setting. For tasks that require multi-sample performance, such as formal theorem proving, GRPO biasedly reinforces already probable solutions and neglects rare but correct proofs. This implicit bias impairs performance on pass@$N$ metrics at large sample sizes, limiting its practicality for training theorem provers. To address this, we introduce the unlikeliness reward, a straightforward method that explicitly encourages reinforcing rare correct solutions. Additionally, we find that increasing the number of PPO epochs further mitigates this bias. Our experiments confirm that incorporating the unlikeliness reward significantly improves pass@$N$ across a large range of N, outperforming standard GRPO and substantially increasing sample diversity. Applying our revised recipe to Lean, we achieve competitive performance with DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL on the miniF2F-test benchmark. We release our implementation, providing a simple yet effective recipe for training formal theorem provers with RL.

Abstract: Credible safety plans for advanced AI development require methods to verify agent behavior and detect potential control deficiencies early. A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing controllability. We argue that evaluating adherence to hierarchical principles is a crucial early step in understanding our capacity to build governable AI systems.

<title>Reconciling Hessian-Informed Acceleration and Scalar-Only Communication for Efficient Federated Zeroth-Order Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Recent dimension-free communication frameworks in Federated Learning (FL), such as DeComFL, significantly reduce per-round communication by transmitting only scalars via zeroth-order stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD). This method is particularly advantageous for federated fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, the high variance in ZO gradient estimation typically leads to slow convergence. Although leveraging Hessian information is known to enhance optimization speed, integrating this into FL presents significant challenges. These include clients' restrictions on local data and the critical need to maintain the dimension-free communication property. To overcome this limitation, we first introduce a generalized scalar-only communication FL framework that decouples dimension-free communication from standard ZO-SGD, enabling the integration of more advanced optimization strategies. Building on this framework, we propose HiSo, a fast federated fine-tuning method via Hessian-informed zeroth-order optimization and Scalar-only communication. Specifically, it leverages global curvature information to accelerate convergence while preserving the same minimal communication cost per round. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees that are independent of the global Lipschitz constant, and further show that HiSo achieves faster rates when the global Hessian exhibits a low effective rank -- a common phenomenon in LLMs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and LLM fine-tuning tasks confirm that HiSo significantly outperforms existing ZO-based FL methods in both convergence speed and communication efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve strong generative performance but often rely on large datasets that may include sensitive content. This challenge is compounded by the models' tendency to memorize training data, raising privacy concerns. SFBD (Lu et al., 2025) addresses this by training on corrupted data and using limited clean samples to capture local structure and improve convergence. However, its iterative denoising and fine-tuning loop requires manual coordination, making it burdensome to implement. We reinterpret SFBD as an alternating projection algorithm and introduce a continuous variant, SFBD flow, that removes the need for alternating steps. We further show its connection to consistency constraint-based methods, and demonstrate that its practical instantiation, Online SFBD, consistently outperforms strong baselines across benchmarks.

Abstract: Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$. This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not "entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics. Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general multi-agent MDPs.
  Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice, providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value decomposition.

Abstract: The challenge of identifying the best feasible arm within a fixed budget has attracted considerable interest in recent years. However, a notable gap remains in the literature: the exact exponential rate at which the error probability approaches zero has yet to be established, even in the relatively simple setting of $K$-armed bandits with Gaussian noise. In this paper, we address this gap by examining the problem within the context of linear bandits. We introduce a novel algorithm for best feasible arm identification that guarantees an exponential decay in the error probability. Remarkably, the decay rate -- characterized by the exponent -- matches the theoretical lower bound derived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach leverages a posterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule involving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations with Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the identification process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations across various problem instances with different levels of complexity. The results corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series prediction or forecasting is critical across many real-world dynamic systems, and recent studies have proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task due to their strong generalization capabilities and ability to perform well without extensive pre-training. However, their effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences. Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.

Abstract: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) faces significant challenges posed by label noise, especially in multiclass classification tasks. Existing methods either lack mechanisms to handle label noise effectively or suffer from high computational costs due to redundant data usage. Inspired by granular computing, this paper proposes granular adaptive boosting (GAdaBoost), a novel two-stage framework comprising a data granulation stage and an adaptive boosting stage, to enhance efficiency and robustness under noisy conditions. To validate its feasibility, an extension of SAMME, termed GAdaBoost.SA, is proposed. Specifically, first, a granular-ball generation method is designed to compress data while preserving diversity and mitigating label noise. Second, the granular ball-based SAMME algorithm focuses on granular balls rather than individual samples, improving efficiency and reducing sensitivity to noise. Experimental results on some noisy datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior robustness and efficiency compared with existing methods, demonstrating that this work effectively extends AdaBoost and SAMME.

arXiv:2506.02392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising learning-based paradigm for addressing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) by minimizing the need for extensive manual engineering. While existing NCO methods, trained on small-scale instances (e.g., 100 nodes), have demonstrated considerable success on problems of similar scale, their performance significantly degrades when applied to large-scale scenarios. This degradation arises from the distributional shift between training and testing data, rendering policies learned on small instances ineffective for larger problems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel learning framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework learns a projection between the training and testing distributions, which is then deployed to enhance the scalability of the NCO model. Notably, unlike prevailing techniques that necessitate joint training with the neural network, our approach operates exclusively during the inference phase, obviating the need for model retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables a backbone model (trained on 100-node instances) to achieve superior performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) of up to 100K nodes from diverse distributions.

Abstract: While random Fourier features are a classic tool in kernel methods, their utility as a pre-processing step for deep learning on tabular data has been largely overlooked. Motivated by shortcomings in tabular deep learning pipelines - revealed through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis - we revisit and repurpose random Fourier mappings as a parameter-free, architecture-agnostic transformation. By projecting each input into a fixed feature space via sine and cosine projections with frequencies drawn once at initialization, this approach circumvents the need for ad hoc normalization or additional learnable embeddings. We show within the NTK framework that this mapping (i) bounds and conditions the network's initial NTK spectrum, and (ii) introduces a bias that shortens the optimization trajectory, thereby accelerating gradient-based training. These effects pre-condition the network with a stable kernel from the outset. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep networks trained on Fourier-transformed inputs converge more rapidly and consistently achieve strong final performance, often with fewer epochs and less hyperparameter tuning. Our findings establish random Fourier pre-processing as a theoretically motivated, plug-and-play enhancement for tabular deep learning.

We introduce AERO (Adversarial Energy-based Redirection Optimization), a novel framework inspired by the redirection principle in Judo, where external disturbances are leveraged rather than resisted. AERO reimagines optimization as a redirection process guided by 15 interrelated axioms encompassing adversarial correction, energy conservation, and disturbance-aware learning. By projecting gradients, integrating uncertainty driven dynamics, and managing learning energy, AERO offers a principled approach to stable and robust model updates. Applied to probabilistic solar energy forecasting, AERO demonstrates substantial gains in predictive accuracy, reliability, and adaptability, especially in noisy and uncertain environments. Our findings highlight AERO as a compelling new direction in the theoretical and practical landscape of optimization.

Abstract: Node classification in real world graphs often suffers from label scarcity and noise, especially in high stakes domains like human trafficking detection and misinformation monitoring. While direct supervision is limited, such graphs frequently contain weak signals, noisy or indirect cues, that can still inform learning. We propose WSNET, a novel weakly supervised graph contrastive learning framework that leverages these weak signals to guide robust representation learning. WSNET integrates graph structure, node features, and multiple noisy supervision sources through a contrastive objective tailored for weakly labeled data. Across three real world datasets and synthetic benchmarks with controlled noise, WSNET consistently outperforms state of the art contrastive and noisy label learning methods by up to 15% in F1 score. Our results highlight the effectiveness of contrastive learning under weak supervision and the promise of exploiting imperfect labels in graph based settings.

Abstract: Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector, resulting in a nonlinear recursive structure. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Nonlinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we propose a novel Nonlinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates its superior performance and computation efficiency in both language and vision modeling.

Abstract: Finite-sum Coupled Compositional Optimization (FCCO), characterized by its coupled compositional objective structure, emerges as an important optimization paradigm for addressing a wide range of machine learning problems. In this paper, we focus on a challenging class of non-convex non-smooth FCCO, where the outer functions are non-smooth weakly convex or convex and the inner functions are smooth or weakly convex. Existing state-of-the-art result face two key limitations: (1) a high iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^6)$ under the assumption that the stochastic inner functions are Lipschitz continuous in expectation; (2) reliance on vanilla SGD-type updates, which are not suitable for deep learning applications. Our main contributions are two fold: (i) We propose stochastic momentum methods tailored for non-smooth FCCO that come with provable convergence guarantees; (ii) We establish a new state-of-the-art iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^5)$. Moreover, we apply our algorithms to multiple inequality constrained non-convex optimization problems involving smooth or weakly convex functional inequality constraints. By optimizing a smoothed hinge penalty based formulation, we achieve a new state-of-the-art complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^5)$ for finding an (nearly) $\epsilon$-level KKT solution. Experiments on three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Continual memory augmentation allows computer-use agents (CUAs) to learn from past interactions and refine their task-solving strategies over time. However, unchecked memory accumulation can introduce spurious or hallucinated "learnings" that degrade agent performance, particularly in domain-specific workflows such as productivity software. We present a novel framework, VerificAgent, that effectively manages memory for CUAs through (1) an expert-curated seed of domain knowledge, (2) iterative, trajectory-based memory refinement during training, and (3) a post-hoc fact-checking pass by human experts to sanitize accumulated memory before deployment. On OSWorld productivity tasks, VerificAgent achieves a 111.1% relative improvement in success rate over baseline CUA without any additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is used to mitigate the privacy risks of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) arising from training on large-scale web data. However, existing unlearning methods often fail to carefully select substitute outputs for forget targets, resulting in Unlearning Aftermaths-undesirable behaviors such as degenerate, hallucinated, or excessively refused responses. We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten targets.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/nklsKrmnn/HIEGNet.git.

<title>Response-Level Rewards Are All You Need for Online Reinforcement Learning in LLMs: A Mathematical Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02553</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e., intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward, while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not, for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency, and holds promise for broad applicability.

<title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Convex Optimization: Balancing Partial-Participation and Efficiency via Noise Cancellation</title>

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of achieving Differential Privacy (DP) in Federated Learning (FL) under partial-participation, where only a subset of the machines participate in each time-step. While previous work achieved optimal performance in full-participation settings, these methods struggled to extend to partial-participation scenarios. Our approach fills this gap by introducing a novel noise-cancellation mechanism that preserves privacy without sacrificing convergence rates or computational efficiency. We analyze our method within the Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) framework and show that it delivers optimal performance for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions. This work expands the applicability of DP in FL, offering an efficient and practical solution for privacy-preserving learning in distributed systems with partial participation.

<title>HATA: Trainable and Hardware-Efficient Hash-Aware Top-k Attention for Scalable Large Model Inference</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a pivotal research area, yet the attention module remains a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, even with techniques like KVCache to mitigate redundant computations. While various top-$k$ attention mechanisms have been proposed to accelerate LLM inference by exploiting the inherent sparsity of attention, they often struggled to strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce HATA (Hash-Aware Top-$k$ Attention), a novel approach that systematically integrates low-overhead learning-to-hash techniques into the Top-$k$ attention process. Different from the existing top-k attention methods which are devoted to seeking an absolute estimation of qk score, typically with a great cost, HATA maps queries and keys into binary hash codes, and acquires the relative qk score order with a quite low cost, which is sufficient for realizing top-k attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HATA achieves up to 7.2$\times$ speedup compared to vanilla full attention while maintaining model accuracy. In addition, HATA outperforms the state-of-the-art top-$k$ attention methods in both accuracy and efficiency across multiple mainstream LLM models and diverse tasks. HATA is open source at https://github.com/gpzlx1/HATA.

<title>Reachability Weighted Offline Goal-conditioned Resampling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) relies on fixed datasets where many potential goals share the same state and action spaces. However, these potential goals are not explicitly represented in the collected trajectories. To learn a generalizable goal-conditioned policy, it is common to sample goals and state-action pairs uniformly using dynamic programming methods such as Q-learning. Uniform sampling, however, requires an intractably large dataset to cover all possible combinations and creates many unreachable state-goal-action pairs that degrade policy performance. Our key insight is that sampling should favor transitions that enable goal achievement. To this end, we propose Reachability Weighted Sampling (RWS). RWS uses a reachability classifier trained via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning on goal-conditioned state-action values. The classifier maps these values to a reachability score, which is then used as a sampling priority. RWS is a plug-and-play module that integrates seamlessly with standard offline RL algorithms. Experiments on six complex simulated robotic manipulation tasks, including those with a robot arm and a dexterous hand, show that RWS significantly improves performance. In one notable case, performance on the HandBlock-Z task improved by nearly 50 percent relative to the baseline. These results indicate the effectiveness of reachability-weighted sampling.

Abstract: The ability to operate safely in increasingly complex traffic scenarios is a fundamental requirement for Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Ensuring the safe release of ADS functions necessitates a precise understanding of the occurring traffic scenarios. To support this objective, this work introduces a pipeline for traffic scenario clustering and the analysis of scenario category completeness. The Clustering Vector Quantized - Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE) is employed for the clustering of highway traffic scenarios and utilized to create various catalogs with differing numbers of traffic scenario categories. Subsequently, the impact of the number of categories on the completeness considerations of the traffic scenario categories is analyzed. The results show an outperforming clustering performance compared to previous work. The trade-off between cluster quality and the amount of required data to maintain completeness is discussed based on the publicly available highD dataset.

We extensively discuss SGF's connections to established world models, evaluate the building blocks in ablation studies, and demonstrate good performance through quantitative comparisons on the Atari 100k benchmark.

Abstract: Self-organizing networks face challenges from complex parameter interdependencies and conflicting objectives. This study introduces two compositional learning approaches-Compositional Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) and Compositional Predictive Decision-Making (CPDM)-and evaluates their performance under training time and safety constraints in multi-agent systems. We propose a modular, two-tier framework with cell-level and cell-pair-level agents to manage heterogeneous agent granularities while reducing model complexity. Numerical simulations reveal a significant reduction in handover failures, along with improved throughput and latency, outperforming conventional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approaches. The approach also demonstrates superior scalability, faster convergence, higher sample efficiency, and safer training in large-scale self-organizing networks.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), have demonstrated excellent capabilities in processing heterogeneous information networks. Self-supervised learning on heterogeneous graphs, especially contrastive self-supervised strategy, shows great potential when there are no labels. However, this approach requires the use of carefully designed graph augmentation strategies and the selection of positive and negative samples. Determining the exact level of similarity between sample pairs is non-trivial.To solve this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised Heterogeneous graph neural network with Optimal Transport (HGOT) method which is designed to facilitate self-supervised learning for heterogeneous graphs without graph augmentation strategies. Different from traditional contrastive self-supervised learning, HGOT employs the optimal transport mechanism to relieve the laborious sampling process of positive and negative samples. Specifically, we design an aggregating view (central view) to integrate the semantic information contained in the views represented by different meta-paths (branch views). Then, we introduce an optimal transport plan to identify the transport relationship between the semantics contained in the branch view and the central view. This allows the optimal transport plan between graphs to align with the representations, forcing the encoder to learn node representations that are more similar to the graph space and of higher quality. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed HGOT model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks. In particular, in the node classification task, HGOT achieves an average of more than 6% improvement in accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods.

arXiv:2506.02623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neural architecture search (NAS) is inherently multi-objective, balancing trade-offs such as accuracy, parameter count, and computational cost. This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures. Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS, this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process. Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal solutions for heterogeneous task settings.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the implicit bias of optimization algorithms has become central to explaining the generalization behavior of deep learning models. For instance, the hyperbolic implicit bias induced by the overparameterization $m \odot w$--though effective in promoting sparsity--can result in a small effective learning rate, which slows down convergence. To overcome this obstacle, we propose HAM (Hyperbolic Aware Minimization), which alternates between an optimizer step and a new hyperbolic mirror step. We derive the Riemannian gradient flow for its combination with gradient descent, leading to improved convergence and a similar beneficial hyperbolic geometry as $m \odot w$ for feature learning. We provide an interpretation of the the algorithm by relating it to natural gradient descent, and an exact characterization of its implicit bias for underdetermined linear regression. HAM's implicit bias consistently boosts performance--even of dense training, as we demonstrate in experiments across diverse tasks, including vision, graph and node classification, and large language model fine-tuning. HAM is especially effective in combination with different sparsification methods, improving upon the state of the art. The hyperbolic step requires minimal computational and memory overhead, it succeeds even with small batch sizes, and its implementation integrates smoothly with existing optimizers.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: City-scale traffic volume prediction plays a pivotal role in intelligent transportation systems, yet remains a challenge due to the inherent incompleteness and bias in observational data. Although deep learning-based methods have shown considerable promise, most existing approaches produce deterministic point estimates, thereby neglecting the uncertainty arising from unobserved traffic flows. Furthermore, current models are typically trained in a city-specific manner, which hinders their generalizability and limits scalability across diverse urban contexts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce TrafficPPT, a Pretrained Probabilistic Transformer designed to model traffic volume as a distributional aggregation of trajectories. Our framework fuses heterogeneous data sources-including real-time observations, historical trajectory data, and road network topology-enabling robust and uncertainty-aware traffic inference. TrafficPPT is initially pretrained on large-scale simulated data spanning multiple urban scenarios, and later fine-tuned on target cities to ensure effective domain adaptation. Experiments on real-world datasets show that TrafficPPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under conditions of extreme data sparsity. Code will be open.

Abstract: As AI advances, copyrighted content faces growing risk of unauthorized use, whether through model training or direct misuse. Building upon invisible adversarial perturbation, recent works developed copyright protections against specific AI techniques such as unauthorized personalization through DreamBooth that are misused. However, these methods offer only short-term security, as they require retraining whenever the underlying model architectures change. To establish long-term protection aiming at better robustness, we go beyond invisible perturbation, and propose a universal approach that embeds \textit{visible} watermarks that are \textit{hard-to-remove} into images. Grounded in a new probabilistic and inverse problem-based formulation, our framework maximizes the discrepancy between the \textit{optimal} reconstruction and the original content. We develop an effective and efficient approximation algorithm to circumvent a intractable bi-level optimization. Experimental results demonstrate superiority of our approach across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Various Transformer-based models have been proposed for time series forecasting. These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.

Abstract: This study critically examines the methodological rigor in credit card fraud detection research, revealing how fundamental evaluation flaws can overshadow algorithmic sophistication. Through deliberate experimentation with improper evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that even simple models can achieve deceptively impressive results when basic methodological principles are violated. Our analysis identifies four critical issues plaguing current approaches: (1) pervasive data leakage from improper preprocessing sequences, (2) intentional vagueness in methodological reporting, (3) inadequate temporal validation for transaction data, and (4) metric manipulation through recall optimization at precision's expense. We present a case study showing how a minimal neural network architecture with data leakage outperforms many sophisticated methods reported in literature, achieving 99.9\% recall despite fundamental evaluation flaws. These findings underscore that proper evaluation methodology matters more than model complexity in fraud detection research. The study serves as a cautionary example of how methodological rigor must precede architectural sophistication, with implications for improving research practices across machine learning applications.

One particular setting of interest arises when the target label space is a subset of the source label space, leading to the framework of partial domain adaptation (PDA). Typical approaches to PDA involve minimizing a domain alignment term and a weighted empirical loss on the source data, with the aim of transferring knowledge between domains. However, a theoretical basis for this procedure is lacking, and in particular, most existing weighting schemes are heuristic. In this work, we derive generalization bounds for the PDA problem based on partial optimal transport. These bounds corroborate the use of the partial Wasserstein distance as a domain alignment term, and lead to theoretically motivated explicit expressions for the empirical source loss weights. Inspired by these bounds, we devise a practical algorithm for PDA, termed WARMPOT. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that WARMPOT is competitive with recent approaches, and that our proposed weights improve on existing schemes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their deployment in real-world applications is hindered by fixed knowledge cutoffs and difficulties in generating controllable, accurate outputs in a single inference. Multi-agent systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution, enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning. However, optimizing these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and limited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent policies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase computational burden. To address these limitations and target the prototypical Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of rollouts. MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability and reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.

Abstract: The widespread utilization of language models in modern applications is inconceivable without Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques, such as low-rank adaptation ($\texttt{LoRA}$), which adds trainable adapters to selected layers. Although $\texttt{LoRA}$ may obtain accurate solutions, it requires significant memory to train large models and intuition on which layers to add adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel method, $\texttt{WeightLoRA}$, which overcomes this issue by adaptive selection of the most critical $\texttt{LoRA}$ heads throughout the optimization process. As a result, we can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining the capability to obtain consistent or even superior metric values. We conduct experiments for a series of competitive benchmarks and DeBERTa, BART, and Llama models, comparing our method with different adaptive approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of $\texttt{WeightLoRA}$ and the superior performance of $\texttt{WeightLoRA+}$ in almost all cases.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) can be framed as a 3-order binary tensor completion task. Tensor decomposition-based (TDB) models have demonstrated strong performance in KGC. In this paper, we provide a summary of existing TDB models and derive a general form for them, serving as a foundation for further exploration of TDB models. Despite the expressiveness of TDB models, they are prone to overfitting. Existing regularization methods merely minimize the norms of embeddings to regularize the model, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose a novel regularization method for TDB models that addresses this limitation. The regularization is applicable to most TDB models and ensures tractable computation. Our method minimizes the norms of intermediate variables involved in the different ways of computing the predicted tensor. To support our regularization method, we provide a theoretical analysis that proves its effect in promoting low trace norm of the predicted tensor to reduce overfitting. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our regularization technique as well as the reliability of our theoretical analysis.

<title>Investigating Mask-aware Prototype Learning for Tabular Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection, which aims at identifying deviant samples, has been crucial in a variety of real-world applications, such as medical disease identification, financial fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, etc. Although recent deep learning-based methods have achieved competitive performances, these methods suffer from representation entanglement and the lack of global correlation modeling, which hinders anomaly detection performance. To tackle the problem, we incorporate mask modeling and prototype learning into tabular anomaly detection. The core idea is to design learnable masks by disentangled representation learning within a projection space and extracting normal dependencies as explicit global prototypes. Specifically, the overall model involves two parts: (i) During encoding, we perform mask modeling in both the data space and projection space with orthogonal basis vectors for learning shared disentangled normal patterns; (ii) During decoding, we decode multiple masked representations in parallel for reconstruction and learn association prototypes to extract normal characteristic correlations. Our proposal derives from a distribution-matching perspective, where both projection space learning and association prototype learning are formulated as optimal transport problems, and the calibration distances are utilized to refine the anomaly scores. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 20 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model.

Abstract: This paper addresses the slow policy optimization convergence of Monte Carlo Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control (MC-PILCO), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm, by integrating it with iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR), a fast trajectory optimization method suitable for nonlinear systems. The proposed method, Exploration-Boosted MC-PILCO (EB-MC-PILCO), leverages iLQR to generate informative, exploratory trajectories and initialize the policy, significantly reducing the number of required optimization steps. Experiments on the cart-pole task demonstrate that EB-MC-PILCO accelerates convergence compared to standard MC-PILCO, achieving up to $\bm{45.9\%}$ reduction in execution time when both methods solve the task in four trials. EB-MC-PILCO also maintains a $\bm{100\%}$ success rate across trials while solving the task faster, even in cases where MC-PILCO converges in fewer iterations.

Abstract: Handling imbalanced target distributions in regression tasks remains a significant challenge in tabular data settings where underrepresented regions can hinder model performance. Among data-level solutions, some proposals, such as random sampling and SMOTE-based approaches, propose adapting classification techniques to regression tasks. However, these methods typically rely on crisp, artificial thresholds over the target variable, a limitation inherited from classification settings that can introduce arbitrariness, often leading to non-intuitive and potentially misleading problem formulations. While recent generative models, such as GANs and VAEs, provide flexible sample synthesis, they come with high computational costs and limited interpretability. In this study, we propose adapting an existing CART-based synthetic data generation method, tailoring it for imbalanced regression. The new method integrates relevance and density-based mechanisms to guide sampling in sparse regions of the target space and employs a threshold-free, feature-driven generation process. Our experimental study focuses on the prediction of extreme target values across benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method is competitive with other resampling and generative strategies in terms of performance, while offering faster execution and greater transparency. These results highlight the method's potential as a transparent, scalable data-level strategy for improving regression models in imbalanced domains.

Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a powerful generalization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that significantly improve our ability to model complex relational data. While directionality has been shown to substantially boost performance in graph learning tasks and is key to many real-world applications, existing SNNs fall short in representing it. To address this limitation, we introduce the Directed Cellular Sheaf, a special type of cellular sheaf designed to explicitly account for edge orientation. Building on this structure, we define a new sheaf Laplacian, the Directed Sheaf Laplacian, which captures both the graph's topology and its directional information. This operator serves as the backbone of the Directed Sheaf Neural Network (DSNN), the first SNN model to embed a directional bias into its architecture. Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmarks show that DSNN consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: Recent studies, including DeepSeek-R1 and Kimi-k1.5, have demonstrated that reinforcement learning with rule-based, binary-valued reward functions can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. These models primarily utilize REINFORCE-based policy optimization techniques, such as REINFORCE with baseline and group relative policy optimization (GRPO). However, a key limitation remains: current policy optimization methods either neglect reward normalization or employ static normalization strategies, which fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of policy updates during training. This may result in unstable gradient estimates and hinder training stability. To address this issue, we propose Beta Normalization Policy Optimization (BNPO), a novel policy optimization method that adaptively normalizes rewards using a Beta distribution with dynamically updated parameters. BNPO aligns the normalization with the changing policy distribution, enabling more precise and lower-variance gradient estimation, which in turn promotes stable training dynamics. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating BNPO's variance-reducing properties and show that it generalizes both REINFORCE and GRPO under binary-valued reward settings. Furthermore, we introduce an advantage decomposition mechanism to extend BNPO's applicability to more complex reward systems. Experimental results confirm that BNPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among policy optimization methods on reasoning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/changyi7231/BNPO.

Abstract: Autonomous agents operating in domains such as robotics or video game simulations must adapt to changing tasks without forgetting about the previous ones. This process called Continual Reinforcement Learning poses non-trivial difficulties, from preventing catastrophic forgetting to ensuring the scalability of the approaches considered. Building on recent advances, we introduce a benchmark providing a suite of video-game navigation scenarios, thus filling a gap in the literature and capturing key challenges : catastrophic forgetting, task adaptation, and memory efficiency. We define a set of various tasks and datasets, evaluation protocols, and metrics to assess the performance of algorithms, including state-of-the-art baselines. Our benchmark is designed not only to foster reproducible research and to accelerate progress in continual reinforcement learning for gaming, but also to provide a reproducible framework for production pipelines -- helping practitioners to identify and to apply effective approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a learning mechanism that falls under the distributed training umbrella, which collaboratively trains a shared global model without disclosing the raw data from different clients. This paper presents an extensive survey on the impact of partial client participation in federated learning. While much of the existing research focuses on addressing issues such as generalization, robustness, and fairness caused by data heterogeneity under the assumption of full client participation, limited attention has been given to the practical and theoretical challenges arising from partial client participation, which is common in real-world scenarios. This survey provides an in-depth review of existing FL methods designed to cope with partial client participation. We offer a comprehensive analysis supported by theoretical insights and empirical findings, along with a structured categorization of these methods, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as pivotal for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently. Fine-grained MoE approaches - utilizing more numerous, smaller experts - have demonstrated potential in improving model convergence and quality. This work proposes a set of training recipes and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of fine-grained MoE, directly comparing its scaling properties against standard MoE configurations for models with up to 56B total (17B active) parameters. We investigate convergence speed, model performance on downstream benchmarks, and practical training considerations across various setups. Overall, at the largest scale we show that fine-grained MoE achieves better validation loss and higher accuracy across a set of downstream benchmarks. This study offers empirical grounding and practical insights for leveraging fine-grained MoE in the development of future large-scale models.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training, yet its practical strength is often undermined by client data heterogeneity, which severely degrades model performance. This paper proposes that data heterogeneity across clients' distributions can be effectively addressed by adopting an approach inspired by opinion dynamics over temporal social networks. We introduce \shortname (Federated Coalition Variance Reduction with Boltzmann Exploration), a variance-reducing selection algorithm in which (1) clients dynamically organize into non-overlapping clusters based on asymptotic agreements, and (2) from each cluster, one client is selected to minimize the expected variance of its model update. Our experiments show that in heterogeneous scenarios our algorithm outperforms existing FL algorithms, yielding more accurate results and faster convergence, validating the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is challenging in non-stationary environments where reward distributions evolve dynamically. We introduce RAVEN-UCB, a novel algorithm that combines theoretical rigor with practical efficiency via variance-aware adaptation. It achieves tighter regret bounds than UCB1 and UCB-V, with gap-dependent regret of order $K \sigma_{\max}^2 \log T / \Delta$ and gap-independent regret of order $\sqrt{K T \log T}$. RAVEN-UCB incorporates three innovations: (1) variance-driven exploration using $\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}_k^2 / (N_k + 1)}$ in confidence bounds, (2) adaptive control via $\alpha_t = \alpha_0 / \log(t + \epsilon)$, and (3) constant-time recursive updates for efficiency. Experiments across non-stationary patterns - distributional changes, periodic shifts, and temporary fluctuations - in synthetic and logistics scenarios demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, confirming theoretical and practical robustness.

arXiv:2506.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.

Abstract: The Multi-Head Attention mechanism is central to LLM operation, and multiple works target its compute and memory efficiency during training. While most works focus on approximating the scaled dot product, the memory consumption of the linear projections that compute the $Q$, $K$, and $V$ tensors from the input $x$ is often overlooked. To address this, we propose Point-Approximate Matrix Multiplication (PAMM), a novel tensor compression technique that reduces memory consumption of the $Q,K,V$ projections in attention layers by a factor of up to $\times 512$, effectively erasing their memory footprint, while achieving similar or better final perplexity. PAMM is fully composable with efficient attention techniques such as FlashAttention, making it a practical and complementary method for memory-efficient LLM training.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual inference is a powerful tool for analysing and evaluating autonomous agents, but its application to language model (LM) agents remains challenging. Existing work on counterfactuals in LMs has primarily focused on token-level counterfactuals, which are often inadequate for LM agents due to their open-ended action spaces. Unlike traditional agents with fixed, clearly defined action spaces, the actions of LM agents are often implicit in the strings they output, making their action spaces difficult to define and interpret. Furthermore, the meanings of individual tokens can shift depending on the context, adding complexity to token-level reasoning and sometimes leading to biased or meaningless counterfactuals. We introduce \emph{Abstract Counterfactuals}, a framework that emphasises high-level characteristics of actions and interactions within an environment, enabling counterfactual reasoning tailored to user-relevant features. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces consistent and meaningful counterfactuals while minimising the undesired side effects of token-level methods. We conduct experiments on text-based games and counterfactual text generation, while considering both token-level and latent-space interventions.

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore, inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been gaining popularity due to its successful adaptation to large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against reconstruction attacks.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML) and aerial connected vehicle (ACV)-assisted edge computing have drawn significant attention lately. Since the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their trajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning (2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c) probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned and nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient counterparts.

Abstract: Recent tabular Foundational Models (FM) such as TabPFN and TabICL, leverage in-context learning to achieve strong performance without gradient updates or fine-tuning. However, their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial vulnerabilities of tabular FM, focusing on both their fragility to targeted test-time attacks and their potential misuse as adversarial tools. We show on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small, structured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction accuracy, even when training context remain fixed. Additionally, we demonstrate that tabular FM can be repurposed to generate transferable evasion to conventional models such as random forests and XGBoost, and on a lesser extent to deep tabular models. To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification problem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the context (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context adversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with adversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights. Our approach improves robustness across multiple tabular benchmarks. Together, these findings position tabular FM as both a target and a source of adversarial threats, highlighting the urgent need for robust training and evaluation practices in this emerging paradigm.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with neural networks benefits from very few theoretical guarantees when it comes to the recovery guarantees. We provide in this work convergence and recovery guarantees for self-supervised neural networks applied to inverse problems, such as Deep Image/Inverse Prior, and trained with inertia featuring both viscous and geometric Hessian-driven dampings. We study both the continuous-time case, i.e., the trajectory of a dynamical system, and the discrete case leading to an inertial algorithm with an adaptive step-size. We show in the continuous-time case that the network can be trained with an optimal accelerated exponential convergence rate compared to the rate obtained with gradient flow. We also show that training a network with our inertial algorithm enjoys similar recovery guarantees though with a less sharp linear convergence rate.

Abstract: The inverse folding problem, aiming to design amino acid sequences that fold into desired three-dimensional structures, is pivotal for various biotechnological applications. Here, we introduce a novel approach leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune an inverse folding model using feedback from a protein folding model. Given a target protein structure, we begin by sampling candidate sequences from the inverse-folding model, then predict the three-dimensional structure of each sequence with the folding model to generate pairwise structural-preference labels. These labels are used to fine-tune the inverse-folding model under the DPO objective. Our results on the CATH 4.2 test set demonstrate that DPO fine-tuning not only improves sequence recovery of baseline models but also leads to a significant improvement in average TM-Score from 0.77 to 0.81, indicating enhanced structure similarity. Furthermore, iterative application of our DPO-based method on challenging protein structures yields substantial gains, with an average TM-Score increase of 79.5\% with regard to the baseline model. This work establishes a promising direction for enhancing protein sequence design ability from structure feedback by effectively utilizing preference optimization.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainties for machine learning (ML) models is a foundational challenge in modern data analysis. This challenge is compounded by at least two key aspects of the field: (a) inconsistent terminology surrounding uncertainty and estimation across disciplines, and (b) the varying technical requirements for establishing trustworthy uncertainties in diverse problem contexts. In this position paper, we aim to clarify the depth of these challenges by identifying these inconsistencies and articulating how different contexts impose distinct epistemic demands. We examine the current landscape of estimation targets (e.g., prediction, inference, simulation-based inference), uncertainty constructs (e.g., frequentist, Bayesian, fiducial), and the approaches used to map between them. Drawing on the literature, we highlight and explain examples of problematic mappings. To help address these issues, we advocate for standards that promote alignment between the \textit{intent} and \textit{implementation} of uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. We discuss several axes of trustworthiness that are necessary (if not sufficient) for reliable UQ in ML models, and show how these axes can inform the design and evaluation of uncertainty-aware ML systems. Our practical recommendations focus on scientific ML, offering illustrative cases and use scenarios, particularly in the context of simulation-based inference (SBI).

Abstract: We address the problem of Schr\"odinger potential estimation, which plays a crucial role in modern generative modelling approaches based on Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic optimal control for SDEs. Given a simple prior diffusion process, these methods search for a path between two given distributions $\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ requiring minimal efforts. The optimal drift in this case can be expressed through a Schr\"odinger potential. In the present paper, we study generalization ability of an empirical Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk minimizer over a class of admissible log-potentials aimed at fitting the marginal distribution at time $T$. Under reasonable assumptions on the target distribution $\rho_T^*$ and the prior process, we derive a non-asymptotic high-probability upper bound on the KL-divergence between $\rho_T^*$ and the terminal density corresponding to the estimated log-potential. In particular, we show that the excess KL-risk may decrease as fast as $O(\log^2 n / n)$ when the sample size $n$ tends to infinity even if both $\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ have unbounded supports.

Abstract: Standard A/B tests in online experiments face statistical power challenges when testing multiple candidates simultaneously, while adaptive experimental designs (AED) alone fall short in inferring experiment statistics such as the average treatment effect, especially with many metrics (e.g., revenue, safety) and heterogeneous variances. This paper proposes a fixed-budget multi-metric AED framework with a two-phase structure: an adaptive exploration phase to identify the best treatment, and a validation phase with an A/B test to verify the treatment's quality and infer statistics. We propose SHRVar, which generalizes sequential halving (SH) (Karnin et al., 2013) with a novel relative-variance-based sampling and an elimination strategy built on reward z-values. It achieves a provable error probability that decreases exponentially, where the exponent generalizes the complexity measure for SH (Karnin et al., 2013) and SHVar (Lalitha et al., 2023) with homogeneous and heterogeneous variances, respectively. Numerical experiments verify our analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of this new framework.

<title>Provable Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with an Unknown Link Function</title>

Abstract: Link functions, which characterize how human preferences are generated from the value function of an RL problem, are a crucial component in designing RLHF algorithms. Almost all RLHF algorithms, including state-of-the-art ones in empirical studies such as DPO and PPO, assume the link function is known to the agent (e.g., a logistic function according to the Bradley-Terry model), which is arguably unrealistic considering the complex nature of human preferences. To avoid link function mis-specification, this paper studies general RLHF problems with unknown link functions. We propose a novel policy optimization algorithm called ZSPO based on a new zeroth-order policy optimization method, where the key is to use human preference to construct a parameter update direction that is positively correlated with the true policy gradient direction. ZSPO achieves it by estimating the sign of the value function difference instead of estimating the gradient from the value function difference, so it does not require knowing the link function. Under mild conditions, ZSPO converges to a stationary policy with a polynomial convergence rate depending on the number of policy iterations and trajectories per iteration. Numerical results also show the superiority of ZSPO under link function mismatch.

<title>Agnostic Learning under Targeted Poisoning: Optimal Rates and the Role of Randomness</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of learning in the presence of an adversary that can corrupt an $\eta$ fraction of the training examples with the goal of causing failure on a specific test point. In the realizable setting, prior work established that the optimal error under such instance-targeted poisoning attacks scales as $\Theta(d\eta)$, where $d$ is the VC dimension of the hypothesis class arXiv:2210.02713. In this work, we resolve the corresponding question in the agnostic setting. We show that the optimal excess error is $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{d\eta})$, answering one of the main open problems left by Hanneke et al. To achieve this rate, it is necessary to use randomized learners: Hanneke et al. showed that deterministic learners can be forced to suffer error close to 1, even under small amounts of poisoning. Perhaps surprisingly, our upper bound remains valid even when the learner's random bits are fully visible to the adversary . In the other direction, our lower bound is stronger than standard PAC-style bounds: instead of tailoring a hard distribution separately for each sample size, we exhibit a single fixed distribution under which the adversary can enforce an excess error of $\Omega(\sqrt{d\eta})$ infinitely often.

<title>StreamBP: Memory-Efficient Exact Backpropagation for Long Sequence Training of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Training language models on long sequence data is a demanding requirement for enhancing the model's capability on complex tasks, e.g., long-chain reasoning. However, as the sequence length scales up, the memory cost for storing activation values becomes huge during the Backpropagation (BP) process, even with the application of gradient checkpointing technique. To tackle this challenge, we propose a memory-efficient and exact BP method called StreamBP, which performs a linear decomposition of the chain rule along the sequence dimension in a layer-wise manner, significantly reducing the memory cost of activation values and logits. The proposed method is applicable to common objectives such as SFT, GRPO, and DPO. From an implementation perspective, StreamBP achieves less computational FLOPs and faster BP speed by leveraging the causal structure of the language model. Compared to gradient checkpointing, StreamBP scales up the maximum sequence length of BP by 2.8-5.5 times larger, while using comparable or even less BP time. Note that StreamBP's sequence length scaling ability can be directly transferred to batch size scaling for accelerating training. We further develop a communication-efficient distributed StreamBP to effectively support multi-GPU training and broaden its applicability. Our code can be easily integrated into the training pipeline of any transformer models and is available at https://github.com/Ledzy/StreamBP.

Abstract: Length generalization is the ability of a learning algorithm to learn a hypothesis which generalizes to longer inputs than the inputs in the training set. In this paper, we provide provable guarantees of length generalization for various classes of functions in an idealized setting. First, we formalize the framework of non-asymptotic length generalization, which requires a computable upper bound for the minimum input length that guarantees length generalization, as a function of the complexity of ground-truth function under some given complexity measure. We refer to this minimum input length to length generalize as length complexity. We show the Minimum-Complexity Interpolator learning algorithm achieves optimal length complexity. We further show that whether a function class admits non-asymptotic length generalization is equivalent to the decidability of its language equivalence problem, which implies that there is no computable upper bound for the length complexity of Context-Free Grammars. On the positive side, we show that the length complexity of Deterministic Finite Automata is $2n - 2$ where $n$ is the number of states of the ground-truth automaton. Our main results are upper bounds of length complexity for a subset of a transformer-related function class called C-RASP (Yang & Chiang, 2024). We show that the length complexity of 1-layer C-RASP functions is $O(T^2)$ when the ground-truth function has precision $T$, and that the length complexity of 2-layer C-RASP functions is $O(T^{O(K)})$ when the ground-truth function has precision $T$ and $K$ heads.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for analyzing graph-structured data in domains such as drug discovery and financial analysis, leading to growing demands for model transparency. Recent advances in explainable GNNs have addressed this need by revealing important subgraphs that influence predictions, but these explanation mechanisms may inadvertently expose models to security risks. This paper investigates how such explanations potentially leak critical decision logic that can be exploited for model stealing. We propose {\method}, a novel stealing framework that integrates explanation alignment for capturing decision logic with guided data augmentation for efficient training under limited queries, enabling effective replication of both the predictive behavior and underlying reasoning patterns of target models. Experiments on molecular graph datasets demonstrate that our approach shows advantages over conventional methods in model stealing. This work highlights important security considerations for the deployment of explainable GNNs in sensitive domains and suggests the need for protective measures against explanation-based attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/beanmah/EGSteal.

<title>From Flat to Hierarchical: Extracting Sparse Representations with Matching Pursuit</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the hypothesis that neural network representations encode abstract, interpretable features as linearly accessible, approximately orthogonal directions, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a popular tool in interpretability. However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model representations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing signatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This raises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds with their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help identify said features and gain further insights into neural network representations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based approach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from sparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a sequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and nonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs on a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical concepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are unable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE recovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the seemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a vision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features are solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the sequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of adaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest. Overall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that interpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with methods emerging from assumptions that fit it.

<title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation as Noisy In-Context Learning: A Unified Theory and Risk Bounds</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has seen many empirical successes in recent years by aiding the LLM with external knowledge. However, its theoretical aspect has remained mostly unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first finite-sample generalization bound for RAG in in-context linear regression and derive an exact bias-variance tradeoff. Our framework views the retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the classical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our analysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on RAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model retrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing uniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample efficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks, such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for stimulating the capabilities of strong pre-trained models by leveraging supervision from weaker supervisors. To improve the performance of the strong model, existing methods often require additional weak models or complex procedures, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. Motivated by the effectiveness of $f$-divergence loss in various machine learning domains, we introduce $f$-divergence as an information-theoretic loss function framework in W2SG. Our theoretical analysis reveals fundamental limitations and equivalence of different $f$-divergence losses in W2SG, supported by sample complexity bounds and information-theoretic insights. We empirically demonstrate that $f$-divergence loss, which generalizes widely-used metrics like KL divergence, effectively improves generalization and noise tolerance of the strong model in practice.

Abstract: The statistical modeling of fluid flows is very challenging due to their multiscale dynamics and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. While recently proposed conditional diffusion models achieve high fidelity, they typically require hundreds of stochastic sampling steps at inference. We introduce a rectified flow framework that learns a time-dependent velocity field, transporting input to output distributions along nearly straight trajectories. By casting sampling as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) along this straighter flow field, our method makes each integration step much more effective, using as few as eight steps versus (more than) 128 steps in standard score-based diffusion, without sacrificing predictive fidelity. Experiments on challenging multiscale flow benchmarks show that rectified flows recover the same posterior distributions as diffusion models, preserve fine-scale features that MSE-trained baselines miss, and deliver high-resolution samples in a fraction of inference time.

Abstract: Pretrained time series models, capable of zero-shot forecasting, have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing both the performance and accessibility of time series forecasting. However, existing pretrained models either do not support covariates or fail to incorporate them effectively. We introduce COSMIC, a zero-shot forecasting model that utilizes covariates via in-context learning. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose Informative Covariate Augmentation, which enables the training of COSMIC without requiring any datasets that include covariates. COSMIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot forecasting, both with and without covariates. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that COSMIC effectively leverages covariates in zero-shot forecasting.

Abstract: We show that low-rank adaptation of large-scale models suffers from a low stable rank that is well below the linear algebraic rank of the subspace, degrading fine-tuning performance. To mitigate the underutilization of the allocated subspace, we propose PoLAR, a parameterization inspired by the polar decomposition that factorizes the low-rank update into two direction matrices constrained to Stiefel manifolds and an unconstrained scale matrix. Our theory shows that PoLAR yields an exponentially faster convergence rate on a canonical low-rank adaptation problem. Pairing the parameterization with Riemannian optimization leads to consistent gains on three different benchmarks testing general language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem solving with base model sizes ranging from 350M to 27B.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on massive text corpora, exhibit remarkable human-level language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities. However, they tend to memorize unwanted information, such as private or copyrighted content, raising significant privacy and legal concerns. Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, but existing methods face a significant challenge of over-forgetting. This issue arises because they indiscriminately suppress the generation of all the tokens in forget samples, leading to a substantial loss of model utility. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Targeted Information Forgetting (TIF) framework, which consists of (1) a flexible targeted information identifier designed to differentiate between unwanted words (UW) and general words (GW) in the forget samples, and (2) a novel Targeted Preference Optimization approach that leverages Logit Preference Loss to unlearn unwanted information associated with UW and Preservation Loss to retain general information in GW, effectively improving the unlearning process while mitigating utility degradation. Extensive experiments on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TIF framework enhances unlearning effectiveness while preserving model utility and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Efficient inference of Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is challenged by deploying the DeepSeek-R1 671B model on a single Multi-GPU server. This paper introduces FlashMLA-ETAP, a novel framework that enhances MLA inference for the single-instance deployment scenario on NVIDIA H20 GPUs. We propose the Efficient Transpose Attention Pipeline (ETAP), which reconfigures attention computation through transposition to align the KV context length with the \(M\)-dimension in WGMMA operations, significantly reducing redundant computations. FlashMLA-ETAP achieves a 2.78x speedup over FlashMLA at 64K sequence length (batch size 16), with 5.24x and 4.94x improvements over FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer, respectively, while maintaining numerical stability with a 15.2x lower RMSE (\(1.25 \times 10^{-5}\)) than FlashAttention-3. Furthermore, ETAP's design enables seamless integration into frameworks like FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer, supported by a detailed theoretical analysis. Our work addresses a critical gap in resource-constrained inference, offering a scalable solution for mid-tier GPUs and paving the way for broader adoption in hardware-aware optimization. Code is available at https://github.com/pengcuo/FlashMLA-ETAP.

Abstract: Distributed systems frequently encounter consistency violation faults (cvfs), where nodes operate on outdated or inaccurate data, adversely affecting convergence and overall system performance. This study presents a machine learning-based approach for analyzing the impact of CVFs, using Dijkstra's Token Ring problem as a case study. By computing program transition ranks and their corresponding effects, the proposed method quantifies the influence of cvfs on system behavior. To address the state space explosion encountered in larger graphs, two models are implemented: a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) and a distributed neural network leveraging TensorFlow's \texttt{tf.distribute} API. These models are trained on datasets generated from smaller graphs (3 to 10 nodes) to predict parameters essential for determining rank effects. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance, with a test loss of 4.39 and a mean absolute error of 1.5. Although distributed training on a CPU did not yield significant speed improvements over a single-device setup, the findings suggest that scalability could be enhanced through the use of advanced hardware accelerators such as GPUs or TPUs.

Abstract: Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) under dynamic and bursty workloads remains a key challenge for real-world deployment. Existing serving frameworks and static model compression techniques fail to adapt to workload fluctuations, leading to either service-level objective (SLO) violations under full-precision serving or persistent accuracy degradation with static quantization. We present MorphServe, a dynamic, workload-aware LLM serving framework based on morphological adaptation. MorphServe introduces two asynchronous, token-level runtime mechanisms: quantized layer swapping, which selectively replaces less impactful layers with quantized alternatives during high-load periods, and pressure-aware KV cache resizing, which dynamically adjusts KV cache capacity in response to memory pressure. These mechanisms enable state-preserving transitions with minimum runtime overhead and are fully compatible with modern scheduling and attention techniques. Extensive experiments on Vicuna and Llama family models with real-world workloads demonstrate that MorphServe reduces average SLO violations by 92.45 percent and improves the P95 TTFT latency by 2.2x-3.9x compared to full-precision serving, without compromising generation quality. These results establish MorphServe as a practical and elastic solution for LLM deployment in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have received increasing attention and it has been widely recognized that classical DNNs have weak adversarial robustness. The most commonly used adversarial defense method, adversarial training, improves the adversarial accuracy of DNNs by generating adversarial examples and retraining the model. However, adversarial training requires a significant computational overhead. In this paper, inspired by existing studies focusing on the clustering properties of DNN output features at each layer and the Progressive Feedforward Collapse phenomenon, we propose a method for adversarial example detection and image recognition that uses layer-wise features to construct feature paths and computes the correlation between the examples feature paths and the class-centered feature paths. Experimental results show that the recognition method achieves 82.77% clean accuracy and 44.17% adversarial accuracy on the ResNet-20 with PFC. Compared to the adversarial training method with 77.64% clean accuracy and 52.94% adversarial accuracy, our method exhibits a trade-off without relying on computationally expensive defense strategies. Furthermore, on the standard ResNet-18, our method maintains this advantage with respective metrics of 80.01% and 46.1%. This result reveals inherent adversarial robustness in DNNs, challenging the conventional understanding of the weak adversarial robustness in DNNs.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in recent years, the foundational Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) framework has been successfully extended to MLLMs, enabling more powerful and universal multi-modal embeddings for a wide range of retrieval tasks. Despite these developments, the core contrastive learning paradigm remains largely unchanged from CLIP-style models to MLLMs. Within this framework, the effective mining of hard negative samples continues to be a critical factor for enhancing performance. Prior works have introduced both offline and online strategies for hard negative mining to improve the efficiency of contrastive learning. While these approaches have led to improved multi-modal embeddings, the specific contribution of each hard negative sample to the learning process has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the gradients of the info-NCE loss with respect to the query, positive, and negative samples, elucidating the role of hard negatives in updating model parameters. Building upon this analysis, we propose to explicitly amplify the gradients associated with hard negative samples, thereby encouraging the model to learn more discriminative embeddings. Our multi-modal embedding model, trained with the proposed Explicit Gradient Amplifier and based on the LLaVA-OneVision-7B architecture, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB benchmark compared to previous methods utilizing the same MLLM backbone. Furthermore, when integrated with our self-developed MLLM, QQMM, our approach attains the top rank on the MMEB leaderboard. Code and models are released on https://github.com/QQ-MM/QQMM-embed.

Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications. In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional space-partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that existing foundational potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.

Abstract: Edge Intelligence (EI) serves as a critical enabler for privacy-preserving systems by providing AI-empowered computation and distributed caching services at the edge, thereby minimizing latency and enhancing data privacy. The integration of blockchain technology further augments EI frameworks by ensuring transactional transparency, auditability, and system-wide reliability through a decentralized network model. However, the operational architecture of such systems introduces inherent vulnerabilities, particularly due to the extensive data interactions between edge gateways (EGs) and the distributed nature of information storage during service provisioning. To address these challenges, we propose an autonomous computing model along with its interaction topologies tailored for privacy-critical and time-sensitive health applications. The system supports continuous monitoring, real-time alert notifications, disease detection, and robust data processing and aggregation. It also includes a data transaction handler and mechanisms for ensuring privacy at the EGs. Moreover, a resource-efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is proposed for the multiclass classification of arrhythmia, enabling accurate and real-time analysis of constrained EGs. Furthermore, a secure access scheme is defined to manage both off-chain and on-chain data sharing and storage. To validate the proposed model, comprehensive security, performance, and cost analyses are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of the fine-grained access control scheme.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or region-of-interest (ROI) features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

Abstract: The de novo generation of drug-like molecules capable of inducing desirable phenotypic changes is receiving increasing attention. However, previous methods predominantly rely on expression profiles to guide molecule generation, but overlook the perturbative effect of the molecules on cellular contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose SmilesGEN, a novel generative model based on variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to generate molecules with potential therapeutic effects. SmilesGEN integrates a pre-trained drug VAE (SmilesNet) with an expression profile VAE (ProfileNet), jointly modeling the interplay between drug perturbations and transcriptional responses in a common latent space. Specifically, ProfileNet is imposed to reconstruct pre-treatment expression profiles when eliminating drug-induced perturbations in the latent space, while SmilesNet is informed by desired expression profiles to generate drug-like molecules. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that SmilesGEN outperforms current state-of-the-art models in generating molecules with higher degree of validity, uniqueness, novelty, as well as higher Tanimoto similarity to known ligands targeting the relevant proteins. Moreover, we evaluate SmilesGEN for scaffold-based molecule optimization and generation of therapeutic agents, and confirmed its superior performance in generating molecules with higher similarity to approved drugs. SmilesGEN establishes a robust framework that leverages gene signatures to generate drug-like molecules that hold promising potential to induce desirable cellular phenotypic changes.

Abstract: Recently, extensive deep learning architectures and pretraining strategies have been explored to support downstream protein applications. Additionally, domain-specific models incorporating biological knowledge have been developed to enhance performance in specialized tasks. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Protap}$, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically compares backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and domain-specific models across diverse and realistic downstream protein applications. Specifically, Protap covers five applications: three general tasks and two novel specialized tasks, i.e., enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage site prediction and targeted protein degradation, which are industrially relevant yet missing from existing benchmarks. For each application, Protap compares various domain-specific models and general architectures under multiple pretraining settings. Our empirical studies imply that: (i) Though large-scale pretraining encoders achieve great results, they often underperform supervised encoders trained on small downstream training sets. (ii) Incorporating structural information during downstream fine-tuning can match or even outperform protein language models pretrained on large-scale sequence corpora. (iii) Domain-specific biological priors can enhance performance on specialized downstream tasks. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Trust-App-AI-Lab/protap.

Abstract: Enabling robots to accurately interpret and execute spoken language instructions is essential for effective human-robot collaboration. Traditional methods rely on speech recognition to transcribe speech into text, often discarding crucial prosodic cues needed for disambiguating intent. We propose a novel approach that directly leverages speech prosody to infer and resolve instruction intent. Predicted intents are integrated into large language models via in-context learning to disambiguate and select appropriate task plans. Additionally, we present the first ambiguous speech dataset for robotics, designed to advance research in speech disambiguation. Our method achieves 95.79% accuracy in detecting referent intents within an utterance and determines the intended task plan of ambiguous instructions with 71.96% accuracy, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve human-robot communication.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their capabilities and guiding their development. However, current evaluations often inconsistently reflect the actual capacities of these models. In this paper, we demonstrate that one of many contributing factors to this \textit{evaluation crisis} is the oversight of unseen knowledge -- information encoded by LLMs but not directly observed or not yet observed during evaluations. We introduce KnowSum, a statistical framework designed to provide a more comprehensive assessment by quantifying the unseen knowledge for a class of evaluation tasks. KnowSum estimates the unobserved portion by extrapolating from the appearance frequencies of observed knowledge instances. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of KnowSum across three critical applications: estimating total knowledge, evaluating information retrieval effectiveness, and measuring output diversity. Our experiments reveal that a substantial volume of knowledge is omitted when relying solely on observed LLM performance. Importantly, KnowSum yields significantly different comparative rankings for several common LLMs based on their internal knowledge.

Abstract: Blockchain transaction data is inherently high dimensional, noisy, and entangled, posing substantial challenges for traditional clustering algorithms. While quantum enhanced clustering models have demonstrated promising performance gains, their interpretability remains limited, restricting their application in sensitive domains such as financial fraud detection and blockchain governance. To address this gap, we propose a two stage analysis framework that synergistically combines quantitative clustering evaluation with AI Agent assisted qualitative interpretation. In the first stage, we employ classical clustering methods and evaluation metrics including the Silhouette Score, Davies Bouldin Index, and Calinski Harabasz Index to determine the optimal cluster count and baseline partition quality. In the second stage, we integrate an AI Agent to generate human readable, semantic explanations of clustering results, identifying intra cluster characteristics and inter cluster relationships. Our experiments reveal that while fully trained Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) outperform random Quantum Features (QF) in quantitative metrics, the AI Agent further uncovers nuanced differences between these methods, notably exposing the singleton cluster phenomenon in QNN driven models. The consolidated insights from both stages consistently endorse the three cluster configuration, demonstrating the practical value of our hybrid approach. This work advances the interpretability frontier in quantum assisted blockchain analytics and lays the groundwork for future autonomous AI orchestrated clustering frameworks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has transformed numerous industries, from healthcare to finance, enhancing decision-making through automated systems. However, the reliability of these systems is mainly dependent on the quality of the underlying datasets, raising ongoing concerns about transparency, accountability, and potential biases. This paper introduces a scorecard designed to evaluate the development of AI datasets, focusing on five key areas from the system card framework data development life cycle: data dictionary, collection process, composition, motivation, and pre-processing. The method follows a structured approach, using an intake form and scoring criteria to assess the quality and completeness of the data set. Applied to four diverse datasets, the methodology reveals strengths and improvement areas. The results are compiled using a scoring system that provides tailored recommendations to enhance the transparency and integrity of the data set. The scorecard addresses technical and ethical aspects, offering a holistic evaluation of data practices. This approach aims to improve the quality of the data set. It offers practical guidance to curators and researchers in developing responsible AI systems, ensuring fairness and accountability in decision support systems.

<title>Stop Chasing the C-index: This Is How We Should Evaluate Our Survival Models</title>

Abstract: We argue that many survival analysis and time-to-event models are incorrectly evaluated. First, we survey many examples of evaluation approaches in the literature and find that most rely on concordance (C-index). However, the C-index only measures a model's discriminative ability and does not assess other important aspects, such as the accuracy of the time-to-event predictions or the calibration of the model's probabilistic estimates. Next, we present a set of key desiderata for choosing the right evaluation metric and discuss their pros and cons. These are tailored to the challenges in survival analysis, such as sensitivity to miscalibration and various censoring assumptions. We hypothesize that the current development of survival metrics conforms to a double-helix ladder, and that model validity and metric validity must stand on the same rung of the assumption ladder. Finally, we discuss the appropriate methods for evaluating a survival model in practice and summarize various viewpoints opposing our analysis.

<title>A meaningful prediction of functional decline in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on multi-event survival analysis</title>

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder of motor neurons that causes progressive paralysis in patients. Current treatment options aim to prolong survival and improve quality of life; however, due to the heterogeneity of the disease, it is often difficult to determine the optimal time for potential therapies or medical interventions. In this study, we propose a novel method to predict the time until a patient with ALS experiences significant functional impairment (ALSFRS-R<=2) with respect to five common functions: speaking, swallowing, handwriting, walking and breathing. We formulate this task as a multi-event survival problem and validate our approach in the PRO-ACT dataset by training five covariate-based survival models to estimate the probability of an event over a 500-day period after a baseline visit. We then predict five event-specific individual survival distributions (ISDs) for each patient, each providing an interpretable and meaningful estimate of when that event will likely take place in the future. The results show that covariate-based models are superior to the Kaplan-Meier estimator at predicting time-to-event outcomes. Additionally, our method enables practitioners to make individual counterfactual predictions, where certain features (covariates) can be changed to see their effect on the predicted outcome. In this regard, we find that Riluzole has little to no impact on predicted functional decline. However, for patients with bulbar-onset ALS, our method predicts considerably shorter counterfactual time-to-event estimates for tasks related to speech and swallowing compared to limb-onset ALS. The proposed method can be applied to current clinical examination data to assess the risk of functional decline and thus allow more personalized treatment planning.

Abstract: Speech quality assessment is a critical process in selecting text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) or voice conversion models. Evaluation of voice synthesis can be done using objective metrics or subjective metrics. Although there are many objective metrics like the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), Perceptual Objective Listening Quality Assessment (POLQA) or Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) but none of them is feasible in selecting the best model. On the other hand subjective metric like Mean Opinion Score is highly reliable but it requires a lot of manual efforts and are time-consuming. To counter the issues in MOS Evaluation, we have developed a novel model, Speaker Agnostic Latent Features (SALF)-Mean Opinion Score (MOS) which is a small-sized, end-to-end, highly generalized and scalable model for predicting MOS score on a scale of 5. We use the sequences of convolutions and stack them to get the latent features of the audio samples to get the best state-of-the-art results based on mean squared error (MSE), Linear Concordance Correlation coefficient (LCC), Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) and Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient (KTAU).

Abstract: Speaker recognition models face challenges in multi-lingual settings due to the entanglement of linguistic information within speaker embeddings. The overlap between vocal traits such as accent, vocal anatomy, and a language's phonetic structure complicates separating linguistic and speaker information. Disentangling these components can significantly improve speaker recognition accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel disentanglement learning strategy that integrates joint learning through prefix-tuned cross-attention. This approach is particularly effective when speakers switch between languages. Experimental results show the model generalizes across monolingual and multi-lingual settings, including unseen languages. Notably, the proposed model improves the equal error rate across multiple datasets, highlighting its ability to separate language information from speaker embeddings and enhance recognition in diverse linguistic conditions.

Abstract: Training SER models in natural, spontaneous speech is especially challenging due to the subtle expression of emotions and the unpredictable nature of real-world audio. In this paper, we present a robust system for the INTERSPEECH 2025 Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic Conditions Challenge, focusing on categorical emotion recognition. Our method combines state-of-the-art audio models with text features enriched by prosodic and spectral cues. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of Fundamental Frequency (F0) quantization and the use of a pretrained audio tagging model. We also employ an ensemble model to improve robustness. On the official test set, our system achieved a Macro F1-score of 39.79% (42.20% on validation). Our results underscore the potential of these methods, and analysis of fusion techniques confirmed the effectiveness of Graph Attention Networks. Our source code is publicly available.

Abstract: Learning alignment between language and vision is a fundamental challenge, especially as multimodal data becomes increasingly detailed and complex. Existing methods often rely on collecting human or AI preferences, which can be costly and time-intensive. We propose an alternative approach that leverages cycle consistency as a supervisory signal. Given an image and generated text, we map the text back to image space using a text-to-image model and compute the similarity between the original image and its reconstruction. Analogously, for text-to-image generation, we measure the textual similarity between an input caption and its reconstruction through the cycle. We use the cycle consistency score to rank candidates and construct a preference dataset of 866K comparison pairs. The reward model trained on our dataset outperforms state-of-the-art alignment metrics on detailed captioning, with superior inference-time scalability when used as a verifier for Best-of-N sampling. Furthermore, performing DPO and Diffusion DPO using our dataset enhances performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks and text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of early models like BERT and GPT-2. To better understand today's language models, we investigate how both classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2)and contemporary large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1) represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology. We train linear and nonlinear classifiers on layer-wise activations to predict word lemmas and inflectional features. We discover that models concentrate lexical information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and linearly separable throughout the layers. Further analysis reveals that these models encode inflectional morphology through generalizable abstractions, but rely predominantly on memorization to encode lexical identity. Remarkably, these patterns emerge across all 16 models we test, despite differences in architecture, size, and training regime (including pretrained and instruction-tuned variants). This consistency suggests that, despite substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties could be fundamental for next token prediction and are learned early during pretraining. Our code is available at https://github.com/ml5885/model_internal_sleuthing.

Clinical CT scenarios, such as low-dose screening, sparse-view scanning, and metal implants, often lead to severe noise and artifacts in reconstructed images, requiring improved reconstruction techniques. The introduction of deep learning has significantly advanced CT image reconstruction. However, obtaining paired training data remains rather challenging due to patient motion and other constraints. Although deep learning methods can still perform well with approximately paired data, they inherently carry the risk of hallucination due to data inconsistencies and model instability. In this paper, we integrate the data fidelity with the state-of-the-art generative AI model, referred to as the Poisson flow generative model (PFGM) with a generalized version PFGM++, and propose a novel CT framework: Flow-Oriented Reconstruction Conditioning Engine (FORCE). In our experiments, the proposed method shows superior performance in various CT imaging tasks, outperforming existing unsupervised reconstruction approaches.

Abstract: This research aims to develop a dynamic and scalable framework to facilitate harmonization of Common Data Elements (CDEs) across heterogeneous biomedical datasets by addressing challenges such as semantic heterogeneity, structural variability, and context dependence to streamline integration, enhance interoperability, and accelerate scientific discovery. Our methodology leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware text embeddings that convert CDEs into dense vectors capturing semantic relationships and patterns. These embeddings are clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to group semantically similar CDEs. The framework incorporates four key steps: (1) LLM-based text embedding to mathematically represent semantic context, (2) unsupervised clustering of embeddings via HDBSCAN, (3) automated labeling using LLM summarization, and (4) supervised learning to train a classifier assigning new or unclustered CDEs to labeled clusters. Evaluated on the NIH NLM CDE Repository with over 24,000 CDEs, the system identified 118 meaningful clusters at an optimized minimum cluster size of 20. The classifier achieved 90.46 percent overall accuracy, performing best in larger categories. External validation against Gravity Projects Social Determinants of Health domains showed strong agreement (Adjusted Rand Index 0.52, Normalized Mutual Information 0.78), indicating that embeddings effectively capture cluster characteristics. This adaptable and scalable approach offers a practical solution to CDE harmonization, improving selection efficiency and supporting ongoing data interoperability.

Abstract: Previous studies have compared the brain and deep neural networks trained on image classification. Intriguingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the correlation between decoded decisions on individual samples in a classification task and thus can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate this method using monkey V4/IT recordings and models trained on image classification tasks.
  We find that model--model similarity is comparable to monkey--monkey similarity, whereas model--monkey similarity is consistently lower and, surprisingly, decreases with increasing ImageNet-1k performance. While adversarial training enhances robustness, it does not improve model--monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions; however, it markedly increases model--model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model--monkey similarity. These results suggest a fundamental divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) has been extensively studied for English. However, there remains a critical gap in its application to Indian languages with a base of 1.5 billion speakers. Pronunciation tools tailored to Indian languages are strikingly lacking despite the fact that millions learn them every year. With over 600 million speakers and being the fourth most-spoken language worldwide, improving Hindi pronunciation is a vital first step toward addressing this gap. This paper proposes 1) Dhvani -- a novel CAPT system for Hindi, 2) synthetic speech generation for Hindi mispronunciations, and 3) a novel methodology for providing personalized feedback to learners. While the system often interacts with learners using Devanagari graphemes, its core analysis targets phonemic distinctions, leveraging Hindi's highly phonetic orthography to analyze mispronounced speech and provide targeted feedback.

<title>Act Only When It Pays: Efficient Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning via Selective Rollouts</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning, such as PPO and GRPO, has powered recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning. Scaling rollout to sample more prompts enables models to selectively use higher-quality data for training, which can stabilize RL training and improve model performance. However, this comes at the cost of significant computational overhead. In this paper, we show that a substantial portion of this overhead can be avoided by skipping uninformative prompts before rollout. Our analysis of reward dynamics reveals a strong temporal consistency in prompt value: prompts that are uninformative in one epoch of training are likely to remain uninformative in future epochs. Based on these insights, we propose GRESO (GRPO with Efficient Selective Rollout), an online, lightweight pre-rollout filtering algorithm that predicts and skips uninformative prompts using reward training dynamics. By evaluating GRESO on a broad range of math reasoning benchmarks and models, such as Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we show that GRESO achieves up to 2.4x wall-clock time speedup in rollout and up to 2.0x speedup in total training time without accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks through high-fidelity outputs, yet flow matching (FM) offers faster inference and empirical performance gains. However, current foundation FM models are computationally prohibitive for finetuning, while diffusion models like Stable Diffusion benefit from efficient architectures and ecosystem support. This work addresses the critical challenge of efficiently transferring knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models to flow matching. We propose Diff2Flow, a novel framework that systematically bridges diffusion and FM paradigms by rescaling timesteps, aligning interpolants, and deriving FM-compatible velocity fields from diffusion predictions. This alignment enables direct and efficient FM finetuning of diffusion priors with no extra computation overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that Diff2Flow outperforms na\"ive FM and diffusion finetuning particularly under parameter-efficient constraints, while achieving superior or competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will release our code at https://github.com/CompVis/diff2flow.

Abstract: Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However, existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1) text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2) unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The data-driven modeling of dynamical systems has become an essential tool for the construction of accurate computational models from real-world data. In this process, the inherent differential structures underlying the considered physical phenomena are often neglected making the reinterpretation of the learned models in a physically meaningful sense very challenging. In this work, we present three data-driven modeling approaches for the construction of dynamical systems with second-order differential structure directly from frequency domain data. Based on the second-order structured barycentric form, we extend the well-known Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson algorithm to the case of second-order systems. Depending on the available computational resources, we propose variations of the proposed method that prioritize either higher computation speed or greater modeling accuracy, and we present a theoretical analysis for the expected accuracy and performance of the proposed methods. Three numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our new structured approaches in comparison to classical unstructured data-driven modeling.

<title>Enabling Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds through Double Diffusion Maps</title>

Abstract: We present a generative learning framework for probabilistic sampling based on an extension of the Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds (PLoM) approach, which is designed to generate statistically consistent realizations of a random vector in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, informed by a limited (yet representative) set of observations. In its original form, PLoM constructs a reduced-order probabilistic model by combining three main components: (a) kernel density estimation to approximate the underlying probability measure, (b) Diffusion Maps to uncover the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold structure, and (c) a reduced-order Ito Stochastic Differential Equation (ISDE) to sample from the learned distribution. A key challenge arises, however, when the number of available data points N is small and the dimensionality of the diffusion-map basis approaches N, resulting in overfitting and loss of generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enabling extension that implements a synthesis of Double Diffusion Maps -- a technique capable of capturing multiscale geometric features of the data -- with Geometric Harmonics (GH), a nonparametric reconstruction method that allows smooth nonlinear interpolation in high-dimensional ambient spaces. This approach enables us to solve a full-order ISDE directly in the latent space, preserving the full dynamical complexity of the system, while leveraging its reduced geometric representation. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are illustrated through two numerical studies: one based on data generated from two-dimensional Hermite polynomial functions and another based on high-fidelity simulations of a detonation wave in a reactive flow.

<title>Assumption-free stability for ranking problems</title>

Abstract: In this work, we consider ranking problems among a finite set of candidates: for instance, selecting the top-$k$ items among a larger list of candidates or obtaining the full ranking of all items in the set. These problems are often unstable, in the sense that estimating a ranking from noisy data can exhibit high sensitivity to small perturbations. Concretely, if we use data to provide a score for each item (say, by aggregating preference data over a sample of users), then for two items with similar scores, small fluctuations in the data can alter the relative ranking of those items. Many existing theoretical results for ranking problems assume a separation condition to avoid this challenge, but real-world data often contains items whose scores are approximately tied, limiting the applicability of existing theory. To address this gap, we develop a new algorithmic stability framework for ranking problems, and propose two novel ranking operators for achieving stable ranking: the \emph{inflated top-$k$} for the top-$k$ selection problem and the \emph{inflated full ranking} for ranking the full list. To enable stability, each method allows for expressing some uncertainty in the output. For both of these two problems, our proposed methods provide guaranteed stability, with no assumptions on data distributions and no dependence on the total number of candidates to be ranked. Experiments on real-world data confirm that the proposed methods offer stability without compromising the informativeness of the output.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of digital health technologies has led to the generation of complex multi-modal data, such as physical activity measurements simultaneously collected from various sensors of mobile and wearable devices. These data hold immense potential for advancing health studies, but current methods predominantly rely on supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled datasets that are often expensive or impractical to obtain, especially in clinical studies. To address this limitation, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called Multi-modal Cross-masked Autoencoder (MoCA) that leverages cross-modality masking and the Transformer autoencoder architecture to utilize both temporal correlations within modalities and cross-modal correlations between data streams. We also provide theoretical guarantees to support the effectiveness of the cross-modality masking scheme in MoCA. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both reconstruction and downstream tasks. We release open-source code for data processing, pre-training, and downstream tasks in the supplementary materials. This work highlights the transformative potential of self-supervised learning in digital health and multi-modal data.

<title>Towards Human-like Preference Profiling in Sequential Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems aspire to profile users by interpreting their interaction histories, echoing how humans make decisions by weighing experience, relative preference strength, and situational relevance. Yet, existing large language model (LLM)-based recommenders often fall short of mimicking the flexible, context-aware decision strategies humans exhibit, neglecting the structured, dynamic, and context-aware mechanisms fundamental to human behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose RecPO, a preference optimization framework that models structured feedback and contextual delay to emulate human-like prioritization in sequential recommendation RecPO exploits adaptive reward margins based on inferred preference hierarchies and temporal signals, enabling the model to favor immediately relevant items and to distinguish between varying degrees of preference and aversion. Extensive experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate that RecPO not only yields performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, but also mirrors key characteristics of human decision-making: favoring timely satisfaction, maintaining coherent preferences, and exercising discernment under shifting contexts.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal item pricing for a unit-demand buyer with independent item values, and the learner has query access to the buyer's value distributions. We consider two common query models in the literature: the sample access model where the learner can obtain a sample of each item value, and the pricing query model where the learner can set a price for an item and obtain a binary signal on whether the sampled value of the item is greater than our proposed price. In this work, we give nearly tight sample complexity and pricing query complexity of the unit-demand pricing problem.

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) for AI Agents offer incredible potential but face challenges due to the need for high-quality training data, especially for multi-steps tasks that involve planning, executing tool calls, and responding to feedback. To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model (LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena, highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM SIMULATOR's efficiency and effectiveness in speeding up development of AI agents.

Abstract: We study gradient descent (GD) with a constant stepsize for $\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression with linearly separable data. Classical theory suggests small stepsizes to ensure monotonic reduction of the optimization objective, achieving exponential convergence in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa)$ steps with $\kappa$ being the condition number. Surprisingly, we show that this can be accelerated to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ by simply using a large stepsize -- for which the objective evolves nonmonotonically. The acceleration brought by large stepsizes extends to minimizing the population risk for separable distributions, improving on the best-known upper bounds on the number of steps to reach a near-optimum. Finally, we characterize the largest stepsize for the local convergence of GD, which also determines the global convergence in special scenarios. Our results extend the analysis of Wu et al. (2024) from convex settings with minimizers at infinity to strongly convex cases with finite minimizers.

Abstract: Data sampling enhances classifier efficiency and robustness through data compression and quality improvement. Recently, the sampling method based on granular-ball (GB) has shown promising performance in generality and noisy classification tasks. However, some limitations remain, including the absence of borderline sampling strategies and issues with class boundary blurring or shrinking due to overlap between GBs. In this paper, an approximate borderline sampling method using GBs is proposed for classification tasks. First, a restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed, which prevents GB overlaps by constrained expansion, preserving precise geometric representation of GBs via redefined ones. Second, based on the concept of heterogeneous nearest neighbor, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling (GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets. Additionally, since RD-GBG incorporates noise detection and GBABS focuses on borderline samples, GBABS performs outstandingly on class noise datasets without the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the GB-based sampling method and several representative sampling methods. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/CherylTse/GBABS.

Abstract: Olfactory navigation is one of the most primitive mechanisms of exploration used by organisms. Navigation by machine olfaction (artificial smell) is a very difficult task to both simulate and solve. With this work, we define olfactory inertial odometry (OIO), a framework for using inertial kinematics, and fast-sampling olfaction sensors to enable navigation by scent analogous to visual inertial odometry (VIO). We establish how principles from SLAM and VIO can be extrapolated to olfaction to enable real-world robotic tasks. We demonstrate OIO with three different odour localization algorithms on a real 5-DoF robot arm over an odour-tracking scenario that resembles real applications in agriculture and food quality control. Our results indicate success in establishing a baseline framework for OIO from which other research in olfactory navigation can build, and we note performance enhancements that can be made to address more complex tasks in the future.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a successful paradigm for leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, it often struggles to generalize beyond the distribution of the provided demonstrations. A recent advancement in enhancing robustness is ICL with explanations (X-ICL), which improves prediction reliability by guiding LLMs to understand and articulate the reasoning behind correct labels. Building on this approach, we introduce an advanced framework that extends X-ICL by systematically exploring explanations for all possible labels (X$^2$-ICL), thereby enabling more comprehensive and robust decision-making. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding datasets validate the effectiveness of X$^2$-ICL, demonstrating significantly improved robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to the existing ICL approaches.

Abstract: Action anticipation, the task of predicting future actions from partially observed videos, is crucial for advancing intelligent systems. Unlike action recognition, which operates on fully observed videos, action anticipation must handle incomplete information. Hence, it requires temporal reasoning, and inherent uncertainty handling. While recent advances have been made, traditional methods often focus solely on visual modalities, neglecting the potential of integrating multiple sources of information. Drawing inspiration from human behavior, we introduce \textit{Multi-level and Multi-modal Action Anticipation (m\&amp;m-Ant)}, a novel multi-modal action anticipation approach that combines both visual and textual cues, while explicitly modeling hierarchical semantic information for more accurate predictions. To address the challenge of inaccurate coarse action labels, we propose a fine-grained label generator paired with a specialized temporal consistency loss function to optimize performance. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets, including Breakfast, 50 Salads, and DARai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results with an average anticipation accuracy improvement of 3.08\% over existing methods. This work underscores the potential of multi-modal and hierarchical modeling in advancing action anticipation and establishes a new benchmark for future research in the field.

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD), a leading cause of disability and mortality, is associated with reward-processing abnormalities and concentration issues. Motivated by the probabilistic reward task from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study, we propose a novel framework that integrates the reinforcement learning (RL) model and drift-diffusion model (DDM) to jointly analyze reward-based decision-making with response times. To account for emerging evidence suggesting that decision-making may alternate between multiple interleaved strategies, we model latent state switching using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the ''engaged'' state, decisions follow an RL-DDM, simultaneously capturing reward processing, decision dynamics, and temporal structure. In contrast, in the ''lapsed'' state, decision-making is modeled using a simplified DDM, where specific parameters are fixed to approximate random guessing with equal probability. The proposed method is implemented using a computationally efficient generalized expectation-maximization algorithm with forward-backward procedures. Through extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms competing approaches under various reward-generating distributions, both with and without strategy switching. When applied to the EMBARC study, our framework reveals that MDD patients exhibit lower overall engagement than healthy controls and experience longer decision times when they do engage. Additionally, we show that neuroimaging measures of brain activities are associated with decision-making characteristics in the ''engaged'' state but not in the ''lapsed'' state, providing evidence of brain-behavioral association specific to the ''engaged'' state.

Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions within dynamic multilayer networks is critical for advancements in various scientific domains. Existing models often fail to capture such networks' temporal and cross-layer dynamics. This paper introduces a novel Tensor State Space Model for Dynamic Multilayer Networks (TSSDMN), utilizing a latent space model framework. TSSDMN employs a symmetric Tucker decomposition to represent latent node features, their interaction patterns, and layer transitions. Then by fixing the latent features and allowing the interaction patterns to evolve over time, TSSDMN uniquely captures both the temporal dynamics within layers and across different layers. The model identifiability conditions are discussed. By treating latent features as variables whose posterior distributions are approximated using a mean-field variational inference approach, a variational Expectation Maximization algorithm is developed for efficient model inference.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) offers a solution to balancing personalization and generalization by conducting federated learning (FL) to guide personalized learning (PL). Little attention has been given to wireless PFL (WPFL), where privacy concerns arise. Performance fairness of PL models is another challenge resulting from communication bottlenecks in WPFL. This paper exploits quantization errors to enhance the privacy of WPFL and proposes a novel quantization-assisted Gaussian differential privacy (DP) mechanism. We analyze the convergence upper bounds of individual PL models by considering the impact of the mechanism (i.e., quantization errors and Gaussian DP noises) and imperfect communication channels on the FL of WPFL. By minimizing the maximum of the bounds, we design an optimal transmission scheduling strategy that yields min-max fairness for WPFL with OFDMA interfaces. This is achieved by revealing the nested structure of this problem to decouple it into subproblems solved sequentially for the client selection, channel allocation, and power control, and for the learning rates and PL-FL weighting coefficients. Experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms alternative scheduling strategies by 87.08%, 16.21%, and 38.37% in accuracy, the maximum test loss of participating clients, and fairness (Jain's index), respectively.

Abstract: IDS aims to protect computer networks from security threats by detecting, notifying, and taking appropriate action to prevent illegal access and protect confidential information. As the globe becomes increasingly dependent on technology and automated processes, ensuring secured systems, applications, and networks has become one of the most significant problems of this era. The global web and digital technology have significantly accelerated the evolution of the modern world, necessitating the use of telecommunications and data transfer platforms. Researchers are enhancing the effectiveness of IDS by incorporating popular datasets into machine learning algorithms. IDS, equipped with machine learning classifiers, enhances security attack detection accuracy by identifying normal or abnormal network traffic. This paper explores the methods of capturing and reviewing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and evaluates the challenges existing datasets face. A deluge of research on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) architecture-based intrusion detection techniques has been conducted in the past ten years on various cybersecurity datasets, including KDDCUP'99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, CICIDS-2017, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. We conducted a literature review and presented an in-depth analysis of various intrusion detection methods that use SVM, KNN, DT, LR, NB, RF, XGBOOST, Adaboost, and ANN. We provide an overview of each technique, explaining the role of the classifiers and algorithms used. A detailed tabular analysis highlights the datasets used, classifiers employed, attacks detected, evaluation metrics, and conclusions drawn. This article offers a thorough review for future IDS research.

<title>A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Computation Offloading in Multi-User Mobile Edge Computing with Decentralization</title>

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows appliances to offload workloads to neighboring MEC servers that have the potential for computation-intensive tasks with limited computational capabilities. This paper studied how deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are used in an MEC system to find feasible decentralized dynamic computation offloading strategies, which leads to the construction of an extensible MEC system that operates effectively with finite feedback. Even though the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, subject to their knowledge of the MEC system, can be used to allocate powers of both computation offloading and local execution, to learn a computation offloading policy for each user independently, we realized that this solution still has some inherent weaknesses. Hence, we introduced a new approach for this problem based on the Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm, which enables us to overcome this proneness and investigate cases where mobile users are portable. Numerical results showed that individual users can autonomously learn adequate policies through the proposed approach. Besides, the performance of the suggested solution exceeded the conventional DDPG-based power control strategy.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to vision-based dexterous grasp translation, which aims to transfer grasp intent across robotic hands with differing morphologies. Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability. Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling.

Abstract: Multi-step symbolic reasoning is critical for advancing downstream performance on financial tasks. Yet, benchmarks for systematically evaluating this capability are lacking. Existing datasets like FinQA and ConvFinQA supervise only final numerical answers, without assessing intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we introduce FinChain, the first symbolic benchmark designed for verifiable Chain-of- Thought (CoT) financial reasoning. Spanning 54 topics across 12 financial domains, Fin- Chain offers five parameterized templates per topic, each varying in reasoning complexity and domain expertise required. Each dataset instance includes an executable Python trace, enabling automatic generation of extensive training data and easy adaptation to other domains. We also introduce ChainEval, a new metric for automatic evaluation of both final answers and intermediate reasoning. Benchmarking 30 LLMs on our dataset, we find that even state-of-the-art models have considerable room for improvement in multi-step financial reasoning. All templates and evaluation metrics for FinChain are available at https: //github.com/mbzuai-nlp/finchain.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming increasingly skilled at handling cybersecurity tasks autonomously. Thoroughly assessing their cybersecurity capabilities is critical and urgent, given the high stakes in this domain. However, existing benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture real-world scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we introduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation framework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities found and patched across 188 large software projects. While it includes tasks of various settings, CyberGym primarily focuses on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests for vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and corresponding source repositories. Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it requires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant code fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target vulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4 state-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best combination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9% reproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing historical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can reveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest versions of the software projects.

Abstract: The fusion of sensor data is essential for a robust perception of the environment in autonomous driving. Learning-based fusion approaches mainly use feature-level fusion to achieve high performance, but their complexity and hardware requirements limit their applicability in near-production vehicles. High-level fusion methods offer robustness with lower computational requirements. Traditional methods, such as the Kalman filter, dominate this area. This paper modifies the Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF) and proposes a novel transformer-based high-level object fusion method called HiLO. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of $25.9$ percentage points in $\textrm{F}_1$ score and $6.1$ percentage points in mean IoU. Evaluation on a new large-scale real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Their generalizability is further validated by cross-domain evaluation between urban and highway scenarios. Code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/HiLO .

Abstract: We study the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for a class of sequence models termed Sequence Single-Index (SSI) models, where the target depends on a single direction in input space applied to a sequence of tokens. This setting generalizes classical single-index models to the sequential domain, encompassing simplified one-layer attention architectures. We derive a closed-form expression for the population loss in terms of a pair of sufficient statistics capturing semantic and positional alignment, and characterize the induced high-dimensional SGD dynamics for these coordinates. Our analysis reveals two distinct training phases: escape from uninformative initialization and alignment with the target subspace, and demonstrates how the sequence length and positional encoding influence convergence speed and learning trajectories. These results provide a rigorous and interpretable foundation for understanding how sequential structure in data can be beneficial for learning with attention-based models.

Abstract: Metaverse and Digital Twin (DT) have attracted much academic and industrial attraction to approach the future digital world. This paper introduces the advantages of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in assisting Metaverse system-based Digital Twin. In this system, we assume that it includes several Metaverse User devices collecting data from the real world to transfer it into the virtual world, a Metaverse Virtual Access Point (MVAP) undertaking the processing of data, and an edge computing server that receives the offloading data from the MVAP. The proposed model works under a dynamic environment with various parameters changing over time. The experiment results show that our proposed DRL algorithm is suitable for offloading tasks to ensure the promptness of DT in a dynamic environment.

Abstract: We study the recovery of multiple high-dimensional signals from two noisy, correlated modalities: a spiked matrix and a spiked tensor sharing a common low-rank structure. This setting generalizes classical spiked matrix and tensor models, unveiling intricate interactions between inference channels and surprising algorithmic behaviors. Notably, while the spiked tensor model is typically intractable at low signal-to-noise ratios, its correlation with the matrix enables efficient recovery via Bayesian Approximate Message Passing, inducing staircase-like phase transitions reminiscent of neural network phenomena. In contrast, empirical risk minimization for joint learning fails: the tensor component obstructs effective matrix recovery, and joint optimization significantly degrades performance, highlighting the limitations of naive multi-modal learning. We show that a simple Sequential Curriculum Learning strategy-first recovering the matrix, then leveraging it to guide tensor recovery-resolves this bottleneck and achieves optimal weak recovery thresholds. This strategy, implementable with spectral methods, emphasizes the critical role of structural correlation and learning order in multi-modal high-dimensional inference.

Abstract: Edge computing addresses the growing data demands of connected-device networks by placing computational resources closer to end users through decentralized infrastructures. This decentralization challenges traditional, fully centralized orchestration, which suffers from latency and resource bottlenecks. We present \textbf{FAuNO} -- \emph{Federated Asynchronous Network Orchestrator} -- a buffered, asynchronous \emph{federated reinforcement-learning} (FRL) framework for decentralized task offloading in edge systems. FAuNO adopts an actor-critic architecture in which local actors learn node-specific dynamics and peer interactions, while a federated critic aggregates experience across agents to encourage efficient cooperation and improve overall system performance. Experiments in the \emph{PeersimGym} environment show that FAuNO consistently matches or exceeds heuristic and federated multi-agent RL baselines in reducing task loss and latency, underscoring its adaptability to dynamic edge-computing scenarios.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to transfer knowledge from a source-domain dataset to unseen target-domain datasets with limited annotations. Current methods typically compare the distance between training and testing samples for mask prediction. However, we find an entanglement problem exists in this widely adopted method, which tends to bind sourcedomain patterns together and make each of them hard to transfer. In this paper, we aim to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both the generalization and finetuning. Experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) offer a powerful framework for sampling graphs in proportion to their rewards. However, existing approaches suffer from systematic biases due to inaccuracies in state transition probability computations. These biases, rooted in the inherent symmetries of graphs, impact both atom-based and fragment-based generation schemes. To address this challenge, we introduce Symmetry-Aware GFlowNets (SA-GFN), a method that incorporates symmetry corrections into the learning process through reward scaling. By integrating bias correction directly into the reward structure, SA-GFN eliminates the need for explicit state transition computations. Empirical results show that SA-GFN enables unbiased sampling while enhancing diversity and consistently generating high-reward graphs that closely match the target distribution.

Unlike recursive least-squares, our method produces full posterior distributions for both the autoregressive coefficients and noise precision. The uncertainties regarding these estimates propagate into the uncertainties on predictions for future system outputs, and support online model evidence calculations. We demonstrate convergence empirically on a synthetic autoregressive system and competitive performance on a double mass-spring-damper system.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with accuracy, domain-specific reasoning, and interpretability in vertical domains. Traditional preference alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often overlook the underlying knowledge sources and reasoning logic. This paper introduces RACE-Align (Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Alignment), a novel framework designed to address these limitations. RACE-Align systematically constructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO algorithm. The core innovation lies in its preference data construction strategy: it integrates AI-driven retrieval for factual grounding, enhancing knowledgeability and accuracy, and emphasizes the optimization of domain-specific CoT, treating the reasoning process itself as a key preference dimension. A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively generates these preference pairs. Experimental validation in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) using Qwen3-1.7B as the base model demonstrates that RACE-Align significantly outperforms the original base model and a model fine-tuned only with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Improvements were observed across multiple dimensions, including answer accuracy, information richness, application of TCM thinking patterns, logicality and depth of reasoning, and interpretability. These findings suggest RACE-Align offers an effective pathway to enhance LLMs' knowledge application, reasoning reliability, and process transparency in complex vertical domains.

Abstract: We address the problem of safely learning controlled stochastic dynamics from discrete-time trajectory observations, ensuring system trajectories remain within predefined safe regions during both training and deployment. Safety-critical constraints of this kind are crucial in applications such as autonomous robotics, finance, and biomedicine. We introduce a method that ensures safe exploration and efficient estimation of system dynamics by iteratively expanding an initial known safe control set using kernel-based confidence bounds. After training, the learned model enables predictions of the system's dynamics and permits safety verification of any given control. Our approach requires only mild smoothness assumptions and access to an initial safe control set, enabling broad applicability to complex real-world systems. We provide theoretical guarantees for safety and derive adaptive learning rates that improve with increasing Sobolev regularity of the true dynamics. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our method in terms of safety, estimation accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating the distribution of outcomes under counterfactual policies is critical for decision-making in domains such as recommendation, advertising, and healthcare. We analyze a novel framework-Counterfactual Policy Mean Embedding (CPME)-that represents the entire counterfactual outcome distribution in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), enabling flexible and nonparametric distributional off-policy evaluation. We introduce both a plug-in estimator and a doubly robust estimator; the latter enjoys improved uniform convergence rates by correcting for bias in both the outcome embedding and propensity models. Building on this, we develop a doubly robust kernel test statistic for hypothesis testing, which achieves asymptotic normality and thus enables computationally efficient testing and straightforward construction of confidence intervals. Our framework also supports sampling from the counterfactual distribution. Numerical simulations illustrate the practical benefits of CPME over existing methods.

arXiv:2506.02802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lakehouse systems enable the same data to be queried with multiple execution engines. However, selecting the engine best suited to run a SQL query still requires a priori knowledge of the query computational requirements and an engine capability, a complex and manual task that only becomes more difficult with the emergence of new engines and workloads. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a cross-engine optimizer that can automate engine selection for diverse SQL queries through a learned cost model. Optimized with hints, a query plan is used for query cost prediction and routing. Cost prediction is formulated as a multi-task learning problem, and multiple predictor heads, corresponding to different engines and provisionings, are used in the model architecture. This eliminates the need to train engine-specific models and allows the flexible addition of new engines at a minimal fine-tuning cost. Results on various databases and engines show that using a query optimized logical plan for cost estimation decreases the average Q-error by even 12.6% over using unoptimized plans as input. Moreover, the proposed cross-engine optimizer reduces the total workload runtime by up to 25.2% in a zero-shot setting and 30.4% in a few-shot setting when compared to random routing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive results in natural language processing tasks but require a significant amount of computational and memory resources. Structured matrix representations are a promising way for reducing the number of parameters of these models. However, it seems unrealistic to expect that weight matrices of pretrained models can be accurately represented by structured matrices without any fine-tuning. To overcome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under certain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices. This insight can be leveraged to identify transformations that significantly improve the compressibility of weights within structured classes. The proposed approach is applicable to various types of structured matrices that support efficient projection operations. Code is available at https://github.com/GrishKate/ProcrustesGPT

Abstract: We present the OmniMatch algorithm for seeded multiple graph matching. In the setting of $d$-dimensional Random Dot Product Graphs (RDPG), we prove that under mild assumptions, OmniMatch with $s$ seeds asymptotically and efficiently perfectly aligns $O(s^{\alpha})$ unseeded vertices -- for $\alpha<2\wedge d/4$ -- across multiple networks even in the presence of no edge correlation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across numerous simulations and in the context of shuffled graph hypothesis testing. In the shuffled testing setting, testing power is lost due to the misalignment/shuffling of vertices across graphs, and we demonstrate the capacity of OmniMatch to correct for misaligned vertices prior to testing and hence recover the lost testing power. We further demonstrate the algorithm on a pair of data examples from connectomics and machine translation.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on a range of multi-agent tasks. Yet, MARL algorithms typically require significantly more environment interactions than their single-agent counterparts to converge, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty in exploring over a large joint action space and the high variance intrinsic to MARL environments. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel algorithm that combines a decomposed centralized critic with decentralized ensemble learning, incorporating several key contributions. The main component in our scheme is a selective exploration method that leverages ensemble kurtosis. We extend the global decomposed critic with a diversity-regularized ensemble of individual critics and utilize its excess kurtosis to guide exploration toward high-uncertainty states and actions. To improve sample efficiency, we train the centralized critic with a novel truncated variation of the TD($\lambda$) algorithm, enabling efficient off-policy learning with reduced variance. On the actor side, our suggested algorithm adapts the mixed samples approach to MARL, mixing on-policy and off-policy loss functions for training the actors. This approach balances between stability and efficiency and outperforms purely off-policy learning. The evaluation shows our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on standard MARL benchmarks, including a variety of SMAC II maps.

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of small UAVs in civilian and military airspace has raised critical safety and security concerns, especially when unauthorized or malicious drones enter restricted zones. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile 1v1 quadrotor pursuit-evasion. We train neural network policies to command body rates and collective thrust, enabling high-speed pursuit and evasive maneuvers that fully exploit the quadrotor's nonlinear dynamics. To mitigate nonstationarity and catastrophic forgetting during adversarial co-training, we introduce an Asynchronous Multi-Stage Population-Based (AMSPB) algorithm where, at each stage, either the pursuer or evader learns against a sampled opponent drawn from a growing population of past and current policies. This continual learning setup ensures monotonic performance improvement and retention of earlier strategies. Our results show that (i) rate-based policies achieve significantly higher capture rates and peak speeds than velocity-level baselines, and (ii) AMSPB yields stable, monotonic gains against a suite of benchmark opponents.

Abstract: Multi-arm bandit experimental designs are increasingly being adopted over standard randomized trials due to their potential to improve outcomes for study participants, enable faster identification of the best-performing options, and/or enhance the precision of estimating key parameters. Current approaches for inference after adaptive sampling either rely on asymptotic normality under restricted experiment designs or underpowered martingale concentration inequalities that lead to weak power in practice. To bypass these limitations, we propose a simulation-based approach for conducting hypothesis tests and constructing confidence intervals for arm specific means and their differences. Our simulation-based approach uses positively biased nuisances to generate additional trajectories of the experiment, which we call \textit{simulation with optimism}. Using these simulations, we characterize the distribution potentially non-normal sample mean test statistic to conduct inference. We provide guarantees for (i) asymptotic type I error control, (ii) convergence of our confidence intervals, and (iii) asymptotic strong consistency of our estimator over a wide variety of common bandit designs. Our empirical results show that our approach achieves the desired coverage while reducing confidence interval widths by up to 50%, with drastic improvements for arms not targeted by the design.

Abstract: The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor, photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark, scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have been recently used for speech enhancement with remarkable success but are computationally expensive at inference time. Therefore, these models are impractical for processing streaming data in real-time. In this work, we adapt a sliding window diffusion framework to the speech enhancement task. Our approach progressively corrupts speech signals through time, assigning more noise to frames close to the present in a buffer. This approach outputs denoised frames with a delay proportional to the chosen buffer size, enabling a trade-off between performance and latency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms standard diffusion models and runs efficiently on a GPU, achieving an input-output latency in the order of 0.3 to 1 seconds. This marks the first practical diffusion-based solution for online speech enhancement.

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a key task in analyzing the heterogeneity of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Although recent foundation models automate this process, they typically annotate cells independently, without considering batch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning. In contrast, human experts often annotate distinct cell types for different cell clusters based on their domain knowledge. To mimic this workflow, we introduce the CellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batch of cells. This benchmark spans diverse tissues, diseases, and donor conditions, and requires reasoning across the batch-level cellular context to ensure label uniqueness. We find that off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) struggle on CellPuzzles, with the best baseline (OpenAI's o1) achieving only 19.0% batch-level accuracy. To fill this gap, we propose Cell-o1, a 7B LLM trained via supervised fine-tuning on distilled reasoning traces, followed by reinforcement learning with batch-level rewards. Cell-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming o1 by over 73% and generalizing well across contexts. Further analysis of training dynamics and reasoning behaviors provides insights into batch-level annotation performance and emergent expert-like reasoning. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/cell-o1.

Abstract: Tool use in stateful environments presents unique challenges for large language models (LLMs), where existing test-time compute strategies relying on repeated trials in the environment are impractical. We propose dynamics modelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction capability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs to predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment model. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success rates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that this substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the model to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the effectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use. We believe this work charts a path towards scalable planning RL methods for LLM inference without repeatedly querying the oracle environment.

Abstract: In this work, we describe our team's approach to eRisk's 2025 Task 1: Search for Symptoms of Depression. Given a set of sentences and the Beck's Depression Inventory - II (BDI) questionnaire, participants were tasked with submitting up to 1,000 sentences per depression symptom in the BDI, sorted by relevance. Participant submissions were evaluated according to standard Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, including Average Precision (AP) and R-Precision (R-PREC). The provided training data, however, consisted of sentences labeled as to whether a given sentence was relevant or not w.r.t. one of BDI's symptoms. Due to this labeling limitation, we framed our development as a binary classification task for each BDI symptom, and evaluated accordingly. To that end, we split the available labeled data into training and validation sets, and explored foundation model fine-tuning, sentence similarity, Large Language Model (LLM) prompting, and ensemble techniques. The validation results revealed that fine-tuning foundation models yielded the best performance, particularly when enhanced with synthetic data to mitigate class imbalance. We also observed that the optimal approach varied by symptom. Based on these insights, we devised five independent test runs, two of which used ensemble methods. These runs achieved the highest scores in the official IR evaluation, outperforming submissions from 16 other teams.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge is a framework in which a large language model (LLM) automatically evaluates the output of another LLM. We propose quantitative LLM judges, which align evaluation scores of existing LLM judges to human scores in a given domain using regression models. The models are trained to improve the score of the original judge by using the judge's textual evaluation and score. We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is limited, which is expected in most applications of our work. We validate these claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show that quantitative judges can effectively improve the predictive power of existing judges through post-hoc modeling.

Abstract: Generative models have become increasingly powerful tools for robot motion generation, enabling flexible and multimodal trajectory generation across various tasks. Yet, most existing approaches remain limited in handling multiple types of constraints, such as collision avoidance and dynamic consistency, which are often treated separately or only partially considered. This paper proposes UniConFlow, a unified flow matching (FM) based framework for trajectory generation that systematically incorporates both equality and inequality constraints. UniConFlow introduces a novel prescribed-time zeroing function to enhance flexibility during the inference process, allowing the model to adapt to varying task requirements. To ensure constraint satisfaction, particularly with respect to obstacle avoidance, admissible action range, and kinodynamic consistency, the guidance inputs to the FM model are derived through a quadratic programming formulation, which enables constraint-aware generation without requiring retraining or auxiliary controllers. We conduct mobile navigation and high-dimensional manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved safety and feasibility compared to state-of-the-art constrained generative planners.

Abstract: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated representations require features that are jointly informative across clients while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models, while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.

Abstract: Bandit Convex Optimization is a fundamental class of sequential decision-making problems, where the learner selects actions from a continuous domain and observes a loss (but not its gradient) at only one point per round. We study this problem in non-stationary environments, and aim to minimize the regret under three standard measures of non-stationarity: the number of switches $S$ in the comparator sequence, the total variation $\Delta$ of the loss functions, and the path-length $P$ of the comparator sequence. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm, Tilted Exponentially Weighted Average with Sleeping Experts (TEWA-SE), which adapts the sleeping experts framework from online convex optimization to the bandit setting. For strongly convex losses, we prove that TEWA-SE is minimax-optimal with respect to known $S$ and $\Delta$ by establishing matching upper and lower bounds. By equipping TEWA-SE with the Bandit-over-Bandit framework, we extend our analysis to environments with unknown non-stationarity measures. For general convex losses, we introduce a second algorithm, clipped Exploration by Optimization (cExO), based on exponential weights over a discretized action space. While not polynomial-time computable, this method achieves minimax-optimal regret with respect to known $S$ and $\Delta$, and improves on the best existing bounds with respect to $P$.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched", and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant superiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing fabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in "non-arguable" scenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of provided case facts). These findings suggest that structured reflection within a multi-agent framework offers a robust computable method for fostering ethical persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation systems, a critical step towards trustworthy AI in law.

Abstract: Open-Source Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) provide extensive resources for various Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yet these resources lack a classification tailored to Software Engineering (SE) needs. To address this gap, we derive a taxonomy encompassing 147 SE tasks and apply an SE-oriented classification to PTMs in a popular open-source ML repository, Hugging Face (HF). Our repository mining study began with a systematically gathered database of PTMs from the HF API, considering their model card descriptions and metadata, and the abstract of the associated arXiv papers. We confirmed SE relevance through multiple filtering steps: detecting outliers, identifying near-identical PTMs, and the use of Gemini 2.0 Flash, which was validated with five pilot studies involving three human annotators. This approach uncovered 2,205 SE PTMs. We find that code generation is the most common SE task among PTMs, primarily focusing on software implementation, while requirements engineering and software design activities receive limited attention. In terms of ML tasks, text generation dominates within SE PTMs. Notably, the number of SE PTMs has increased markedly since 2023 Q2. Our classification provides a solid foundation for future automated SE scenarios, such as the sampling and selection of suitable PTMs.

Abstract: Accurately assessing internal human states is key to understanding preferences, offering personalized services, and identifying challenges in real-world applications. Originating from psychometrics, adaptive testing has become the mainstream method for human measurement and has now been widely applied in education, healthcare, sports, and sociology. It customizes assessments by selecting the fewest test questions . However, current adaptive testing methods face several challenges. The mechanized nature of most algorithms leads to guessing behavior and difficulties with open-ended questions. Additionally, subjective assessments suffer from noisy response data and coarse-grained test outputs, further limiting their effectiveness. To move closer to an ideal adaptive testing process, we propose TestAgent, a large language model (LLM)-powered agent designed to enhance adaptive testing through interactive engagement. This is the first application of LLMs in adaptive testing. TestAgent supports personalized question selection, captures test-takers' responses and anomalies, and provides precise outcomes through dynamic, conversational interactions. Experiments on psychological, educational, and lifestyle assessments show our approach achieves more accurate results with 20% fewer questions than state-of-the-art baselines, and testers preferred it in speed, smoothness, and other dimensions.

Abstract: We study the advantages of accelerated gradient methods, specifically based on the Frank-Wolfe method and projected gradient descent, for privacy and heavy-tailed robustness. Our approaches are as follows: For the Frank-Wolfe method, our technique is based on a tailored learning rate and a uniform lower bound on the gradient of the $\ell_2$-norm over the constraint set. For accelerating projected gradient descent, we use the popular variant based on Nesterov's momentum, and we optimize our objective over $\mathbb{R}^p$. These accelerations reduce iteration complexity, translating into stronger statistical guarantees for empirical and population risk minimization. Our analysis covers three settings: non-random data, random model-free data, and parametric models (linear regression and generalized linear models). Methodologically, we approach both privacy and robustness based on noisy gradients. We ensure differential privacy via the Gaussian mechanism and advanced composition, and we achieve heavy-tailed robustness using a geometric median-of-means estimator, which also sharpens the dependency on the dimension of the covariates. Finally, we compare our rates to existing bounds and identify scenarios where our methods attain optimal convergence.

Abstract: We explore the role of torsion in hybrid deep learning models that incorporate topological data analysis, focusing on autoencoders. While most TDA tools use field coefficients, this conceals torsional features present in integer homology. We show that torsion can be lost during encoding, altered in the latent space, and in many cases, not reconstructed by standard decoders. Using both synthetic and high-dimensional data, we evaluate torsion sensitivity to perturbations and assess its recoverability across several autoencoder architectures. Our findings reveal key limitations of field-based approaches and underline the need for architectures or loss terms that preserve torsional information for robust data representation.

Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE) framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing, both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) face a critical safety challenge: as capabilities scale, instrumental convergence drives default trajectories toward loss of human control, potentially culminating in existential catastrophe. Current alignment approaches struggle with value specification complexity and fail to address emergent power-seeking behaviors. We propose "Corrigibility as a Singular Target" (CAST)-designing FMs whose overriding objective is empowering designated human principals to guide, correct, and control them. This paradigm shift from static value-loading to dynamic human empowerment transforms instrumental drives: self-preservation serves only to maintain the principal's control; goal modification becomes facilitating principal guidance. We present a comprehensive empirical research agenda spanning training methodologies (RLAIF, SFT, synthetic data generation), scalability testing across model sizes, and demonstrations of controlled instructability. Our vision: FMs that become increasingly responsive to human guidance as capabilities grow, offering a path to beneficial AI that remains as tool-like as possible, rather than supplanting human judgment. This addresses the core alignment problem at its source, preventing the default trajectory toward misaligned instrumental convergence.

Abstract: While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns: diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\% attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1), Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$, and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video synthesis.

Abstract: The importance of clinical variables in the prognosis of the disease is explained using statistical correlation or machine learning (ML). However, the predictive importance of these variables may not represent their causal relationships with diseases. This paper uses clinical variables from a heart failure (HF) patient cohort to investigate the causal explainability of important variables obtained in statistical and ML contexts. Due to inherent regression modeling, popular causal discovery methods strictly assume that the cause and effect variables are numerical and continuous. This paper proposes a new computational framework to enable causal structure discovery (CSD) and score the causal strength of mixed-type (categorical, numerical, binary) clinical variables for binary disease outcomes. In HF classification, we investigate the association between the importance rank order of three feature types: correlated features, features important for ML predictions, and causal features. Our results demonstrate that CSD modeling for nonlinear causal relationships is more meaningful than its linear counterparts. Feature importance obtained from nonlinear classifiers (e.g., gradient-boosting trees) strongly correlates with the causal strength of variables without differentiating cause and effect variables. Correlated variables can be causal for HF, but they are rarely identified as effect variables. These results can be used to add the causal explanation of variables important for ML-based prediction modeling.

Abstract: We present `GL-LowPopArt`, a novel Catoni-style estimator for generalized low-rank trace regression. Building on `LowPopArt` (Jang et al., 2024), it employs a two-stage approach: nuclear norm regularization followed by matrix Catoni estimation. We establish state-of-the-art estimation error bounds, surpassing existing guarantees (Fan et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2022), and reveal a novel experimental design objective, $\mathrm{GL}(\pi)$. The key technical challenge is controlling bias from the nonlinear inverse link function, which we address by our two-stage approach. We prove a *local* minimax lower bound, showing that our `GL-LowPopArt` enjoys instance-wise optimality up to the condition number of the ground-truth Hessian. Applications include generalized linear matrix completion, where `GL-LowPopArt` achieves a state-of-the-art Frobenius error guarantee, and **bilinear dueling bandits**, a novel setting inspired by general preference learning (Zhang et al., 2024). Our analysis of a `GL-LowPopArt`-based explore-then-commit algorithm reveals a new, potentially interesting problem-dependent quantity, along with improved Borda regret bound than vectorization (Wu et al., 2024).

<title>Modelling the Effects of Hearing Loss on Neural Coding in the Auditory Midbrain with Variational Conditioning</title>

Abstract: The mapping from sound to neural activity that underlies hearing is highly non-linear. The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been modelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more recently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models. Modelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory processing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for training DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken advantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory midbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this model assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore it cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss.
  We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space of hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory midbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised by only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62\% of the explainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68% for hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the art animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to simulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the learned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving crossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more animals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen animals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss compensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing impaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the loop optimisation.

Abstract: Contrastive language-image pre-training aligns the features of text-image pairs in a common latent space via distinct encoders for each modality. While this approach achieves impressive performance in several zero-shot tasks, it cannot natively handle multimodal inputs, i.e., encoding image and text into a single feature vector. As a remedy, it is common practice to use additional modules to merge the features extracted by the unimodal encoders. In this work, we present FuseLIP, an alternative architecture for multimodal embedding. Leveraging recent progress in discrete image tokenizers, we propose to use a single transformer model which operates on an extended vocabulary of text and image tokens. This early fusion approach allows the different modalities to interact at each depth of encoding and obtain richer representations compared to common late fusion. We collect new datasets for multimodal pre-training and evaluation, designing challenging tasks for multimodal encoder models. We show that FuseLIP outperforms other approaches in multimodal embedding tasks such as VQA and text-guided image transformation retrieval, while being comparable to baselines on unimodal tasks.

Abstract: Monitoring aboveground biomass (AGB) and its density (AGBD) at high resolution is essential for carbon accounting and ecosystem management. While NASA's spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR mission provides globally distributed reference measurements for AGBD estimation, the majority of commercial remote sensing products based on GEDI remain without rigorous or independent validation. Here, we present an independent regional validation of an AGBD dataset offered by terraPulse, Inc., based on independent reference data from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. Aggregated to 64,000-hectare hexagons and US counties across the US states of Utah, Nevada, and Washington, we found very strong agreement between terraPulse and FIA estimates. At the hexagon scale, we report R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 26.68 Mg/ha, and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.94. At the county scale, agreement improves to R2 = 0.90, RMSE =32.62 Mg/ha, slope = 1.07, and r = 0.95. Spatial and statistical analyses indicated that terraPulse AGBD values tended to exceed FIA estimates in non-forest areas, likely due to FIA's limited sampling of non-forest vegetation. The terraPulse AGBD estimates also exhibited lower values in high-biomass forests, likely due to saturation effects in its optical remote-sensing covariates. This study advances operational carbon monitoring by delivering a scalable framework for comprehensive AGBD validation using independent FIA data, as well as a benchmark validation of a new commercial dataset for global biomass monitoring.

Abstract: We introduce native-resolution image synthesis, a novel generative modeling paradigm that enables the synthesis of images at arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional fixed-resolution, square-image methods by natively handling variable-length visual tokens, a core challenge for traditional techniques. To this end, we introduce the Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT), an architecture designed to explicitly model varying resolutions and aspect ratios within its denoising process. Free from the constraints of fixed formats, NiT learns intrinsic visual distributions from images spanning a broad range of resolutions and aspect ratios. Notably, a single NiT model simultaneously achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet-256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks. Surprisingly, akin to the robust zero-shot capabilities seen in advanced large language models, NiT, trained solely on ImageNet, demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization performance. It successfully generates high-fidelity images at previously unseen high resolutions (e.g., 1536 x 1536) and diverse aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9, 3:1, 4:3), as shown in Figure 1. These findings indicate the significant potential of native-resolution modeling as a bridge between visual generative modeling and advanced LLM methodologies.

<title>Causal Estimation of Tokenisation Bias</title>

Abstract: Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but ultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it does. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a subword (e.g., $\langle hello \rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e., \textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an arbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing similar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and tokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1) high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2) synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues; and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing controllable video generation methods.

Abstract: Transfer learning research attempts to make model induction transferable across different domains. This method assumes that specific information regarding to which domain each instance belongs is known. This paper helps to extend the capability of transfer learning for linear regression problems to situations where the domain information is uncertain or unknown; in fact, the framework can be extended to classification problems. For normal datasets, we assume that some latent domain information is available for transfer learning. The instances in each domain can be inferred by different parameters. We obtain this domain information from the distribution of the regression coefficients corresponding to the explanatory variable $x$ as well as the response variable $y$ based on a Dirichlet process, which is more reasonable. As a result, we transfer not only variable $x$ as usual but also variable $y$, which is challenging since the testing data have no response value. Previous work mainly overcomes the problem via pseudo-labelling based on transductive learning, which introduces serious bias. We provide a novel framework for analysing the problem and considering this general situation: the joint distribution of variable $x$ and variable $y$. Furthermore, our method controls the bias well compared with previous work. We perform linear regression on the new feature space that consists of different latent domains and the target domain, which is from the testing data. The experimental results show that the proposed model performs well on real datasets.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful in terms of their inference abilities, but are also notorious for their incompleteness and long-tail distribution of relations. To address these challenges and expand the coverage of KGs, few-shot KG completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level information and/or imposing a potentially invalid sequential dependency assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method (HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe can effectively learn and refine meta representations of few-shot relations, and thus generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe over state-of-the-art methods. The code can be found in https://github.com/alexhw15/HiRe.git.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization has attracted huge attention from diverse research areas in science and engineering, since it is capable of efficiently finding a global optimum of an expensive-to-evaluate black-box function. In general, a probabilistic regression model is widely used as a surrogate function to model an explicit distribution over function evaluations given an input to estimate and a training dataset. Beyond the probabilistic regression-based methods, density ratio estimation-based Bayesian optimization has been suggested in order to estimate a density ratio of the groups relatively close and relatively far to a global optimum. Developing this line of research further, supervised classifiers are employed to estimate a class probability for the two groups instead of a density ratio. However, the supervised classifiers used in this strategy are prone to be overconfident for known knowledge on global solution candidates. Supposing that we have access to unlabeled points, e.g., predefined fixed-size pools, we propose density ratio estimation-based Bayesian optimization with semi-supervised learning to solve this challenge. Finally, we show the empirical results of our methods and several baseline methods in two distinct scenarios with unlabeled point sampling and a fixed-size pool, and analyze the validity of our methods in diverse experiments.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) achieve scalability by dynamically activating subsets of their components. Yet, understanding how expertise emerges through joint training of gating mechanisms and experts remains incomplete, especially in scenarios without clear task partitions. Motivated by inference costs and data heterogeneity, we study how joint training of gating functions and experts can dynamically allocate domain-specific expertise across multiple underlying data distributions. As an outcome of our framework, we develop an instance tailored specifically to decentralized training scenarios, introducing \textit{Dynamically Decentralized Orchestration of MoEs} or \texttt{DDOME}. \texttt{DDOME} leverages heterogeneity emerging from distributional shifts across decentralized data sources to specialize experts dynamically. By integrating a pretrained common expert to inform a gating function, \texttt{DDOME} achieves personalized expert subset selection on-the-fly, facilitating just-in-time personalization. We empirically validate \texttt{DDOME} within a Federated Learning (FL) context: \texttt{DDOME} attains from 4\% up to an 24\% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art FL baselines in image and text classification tasks, while maintaining competitive zero-shot generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights confirming that the joint gating-experts training is critical for achieving meaningful expert specialization.

Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive study combining mathematical and computational analysis to explain why a two-layer neural network struggles to handle high frequencies in both approximation and learning, especially when machine precision, numerical noise, and computational cost are significant factors in practice. Specifically, we investigate the following fundamental computational issues: (1) the minimal numerical error achievable under finite precision, (2) the computational cost required to attain a given accuracy, and (3) the stability of the method with respect to perturbations. The core of our analysis lies in the conditioning of the representation and its learning dynamics. Explicit answers to these questions are provided, along with supporting numerical evidence.

Abstract: We propose Mirror Descent Optimal Transport (MDOT), a novel method for solving discrete optimal transport (OT) problems with high precision, by unifying temperature annealing in entropic-regularized OT (EOT) with mirror descent techniques. In this framework, temperature annealing produces a sequence of EOT dual problems, whose solution gradually gets closer to the solution of the original OT problem. We solve each problem efficiently using a GPU-parallel nonlinear conjugate gradients algorithm (PNCG) that outperforms traditional Sinkhorn iterations under weak regularization. Moreover, our investigation also reveals that the theoretical convergence rate of Sinkhorn iterations can exceed existing non-asymptotic bounds when its stopping criterion is tuned in a manner analogous to MDOT.
  Our comprehensive ablation studies of MDOT-PNCG affirm its robustness across a wide range of algorithmic parameters. Benchmarking on 24 problem sets of size $n=4096$ in a GPU environment demonstrate that our method attains high-precision, feasible solutions significantly faster than a representative set of existing OT solvers, including accelerated gradient methods and advanced Sinkhorn variants, in both wall-clock time and number of operations. Empirical convergence rates range between $O(n^2 \varepsilon^{-1/4})$ and $O(n^2 \varepsilon^{-1})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the optimality gap. For problem sizes up to $n=16384$, the empirical runtime scales as $O(n^2)$ for moderate precision and as $O(n^{5/2})$ at worst for high precision. These findings establish MDOT-PNCG as a compelling alternative to current OT solvers, particularly in challenging weak-regularization regimes.

Abstract: Node representation learning on attributed graphs -- whose nodes are associated with rich attributes (e.g., texts and protein sequences) -- plays a crucial role in many important downstream tasks. To encode the attributes and graph structures simultaneously, recent studies integrate pre-trained models with graph neural networks (GNNs), where pre-trained models serve as node encoders (NEs) to encode the attributes. As jointly training large NEs and GNNs on large-scale graphs suffers from severe scalability issues, many methods propose to train NEs and GNNs separately. Consequently, they do not take feature convolutions in GNNs into consideration in the training phase of NEs, leading to a significant learning bias relative to the joint training. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient label regularization technique, namely Label Deconvolution (LD), to alleviate the learning bias by a novel and highly scalable approximation to the inverse mapping of GNNs. The inverse mapping leads to an objective function that is equivalent to that by the joint training, while it can effectively incorporate GNNs in the training phase of NEs against the learning bias. More importantly, we show that LD converges to the optimal objective function values by the joint training under mild assumptions. Experiments demonstrate LD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Open Graph Benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a critical challenge in various domains and has witnessed substantial progress in recent years. Many real-life scenarios, such as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity, introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions. Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains, performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series forecasting from a machine-learning perspective.
  In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS), addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly. We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The results demonstrate that FPS consistently outperforms conventional time-series forecasting methods, highlighting its efficacy in handling performativity-induced challenges.

Abstract: Stochastic simulation models effectively capture complex system dynamics but are often too slow for real-time decision-making. Traditional metamodeling techniques learn relationships between simulator inputs and a single output summary statistic, such as the mean or median. These techniques enable real-time predictions without additional simulations. However, they require prior selection of one appropriate output summary statistic, limiting their flexibility in practical applications. We propose a new concept: generative metamodeling. It aims to construct a "fast simulator of the simulator," generating random outputs significantly faster than the original simulator while preserving approximately equal conditional distributions. Generative metamodels enable rapid generation of numerous random outputs upon input specification, facilitating immediate computation of any summary statistic for real-time decision-making. We introduce a new algorithm, quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM), and establish its distributional convergence and convergence rate. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate QRGMM's efficacy compared to other state-of-the-art generative algorithms in practical real-time decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents have no incentive to exhibit predictable behaviors, and are often pushed (through e.g. policy entropy regularisation) to randomise their actions in favor of exploration. This often makes it challenging for other agents and humans to predict an agent's behavior, triggering unsafe scenarios (e.g. in human-robot interaction). We propose a novel method to induce predictable behavior in RL agents, termed Predictability-Aware RL (PARL), employing the agent's trajectory entropy rate to quantify predictability. Our method maximizes a linear combination of a standard discounted reward and the negative entropy rate, thus trading off optimality with predictability. We show how the entropy rate can be formally cast as an average reward, how entropy-rate value functions can be estimated from a learned model and incorporate this in policy-gradient algorithms, and demonstrate how this approach produces predictable (near-optimal) policies in tasks inspired by human-robot use-cases.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to predict the next state of a dynamical system when the underlying evolution function is unknown. Unlike previous work, we place no parametric assumptions on the dynamical system, and study the problem from a learning theory perspective. We define new combinatorial measures and dimensions and show that they quantify the optimal mistake and regret bounds in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively. By doing so, we find that in the realizable setting, the total number of mistakes can grow according to \emph{any} increasing function of the time horizon $T$. In contrast, we show that in the agnostic setting under the commonly studied notion of Markovian regret, the only possible rates are $\Theta(T)$ and $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$.

Abstract: In this work we show that the size versus accuracy trade-off of neural network quantization can be significantly improved by increasing the quantization dimensionality. We propose the GPTVQ method, a new fast method for post-training vector quantization (VQ) that scales well to Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method interleaves quantization of one or more columns with updates to the remaining unquantized weights, using information from the Hessian of the per-layer output reconstruction MSE. Quantization codebooks are initialized using an efficient data-aware version of the EM algorithm. The codebooks are then updated, and further compressed by using integer quantization and SVD-based compression. GPTVQ establishes a new state-of-the art in the size vs accuracy trade-offs on a wide range of LLMs such as Llama-v2 and Mistral. Furthermore, our method is efficient: on a single H100 it takes between 3 and 11 hours to process a Llamav2-70B model, depending on quantization setting. Lastly, with on-device timings for VQ decompression on a mobile CPU we show that VQ leads to improved latency compared to using a 4-bit integer format.

Abstract: In lung radiotherapy, infrared cameras can track reflective objects on the chest to estimate tumor motion due to breathing, but treatment system latencies hinder radiation beam precision. Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is a potential solution that can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D positions of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI that compress the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and accurately update the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. Data was originally sampled at 10Hz; we resampled it at 3.33Hz and 30Hz to analyze the effect of the sampling rate on performance. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons h<=2.1s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, kernel support vector regression, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSEs) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the lowest nRMSE at 30Hz, equal to 0.086. DNI's inference time (6.8ms per time step at 30Hz, Intel Core i7-13700 CPU) was the lowest among the RNN methods.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success in many applications. However, existing studies are largely based on the closed-world assumption, which assumes that the environment is stationary, and the model is fixed once deployed. In many real-world applications, this fundamental and rather naive assumption may not hold because an open environment is complex, dynamic, and full of unknowns. In such cases, rejecting unknowns, discovering novelties, and then continually learning them, could enable models to be safe and evolve continually as biological systems do. This article presents a holistic view of open-world machine learning by investigating unknown rejection, novelty discovery, and continual learning in a unified paradigm. The challenges, principles, and limitations of current methodologies are discussed in detail. Furthermore, widely used benchmarks, metrics, and performances are summarized. Finally, we discuss several potential directions for further progress in the field. By providing a comprehensive introduction to the emerging open-world machine learning paradigm, this article aims to help researchers build more powerful AI systems in their respective fields, and to promote the development of artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Recourse generators provide actionable insights, often through feature-based counterfactual explanations (CFEs), to help negatively classified individuals understand how to adjust their input features to achieve a positive classification. These feature-based CFEs, which we refer to as \emph{low-level} CFEs, are overly specific (e.g., coding experience: \(4 \to 5+\) years) and often recommended in a feature space that doesn't straightforwardly align with real-world actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce three novel recourse types grounded in real-world actions: high-level continuous (\emph{hl-continuous}), high-level discrete (\emph{hl-discrete}), and high-level ID (\emph{hl-id}) CFEs.
  We formulate single-agent CFE generation methods, where we model the hl-discrete CFE as a solution to a weighted set cover problem and the hl-continuous CFE as a solution to an integer linear program. Since these methods require costly optimization per agent, we propose data-driven CFE generation approaches that, given instances of agents and their optimal CFEs, learn a CFE generator that quickly provides optimal CFEs for new agents. This approach, also viewed as one of learning an optimal policy in a family of large but deterministic MDPs, considers several problem formulations, including formulations in which the actions and their effects are unknown, and therefore addresses informational and computational challenges.
  We conduct extensive empirical evaluations using healthcare datasets (BRFSS, Foods, and NHANES) and fully-synthetic data. For negatively classified agents identified by linear or threshold-based classifiers, we compare the high-level CFE to low-level CFEs and assess the effectiveness of our network-based, data-driven approaches. Results show that the data-driven CFE generators are accurate, and resource-efficient, and high-level CFEs offer key advantages over low-level CFEs.

Abstract: Diffusion or score-based models recently showed high performance in image generation. They rely on a forward and a backward stochastic differential equations (SDE). The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by numerically solving the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization error and the score approximation. In this paper, we theoretically study the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. Our first contribution is to derive the analytical solutions of the backward SDE and the probability flow ODE and to prove that these solutions and their discretizations are all Gaussian processes. Our second contribution is to compute the exact Wasserstein errors between the target and the numerically sampled distributions for any numerical scheme. This allows us to monitor convergence directly in the data space, while experimental works limit their empirical analysis to Inception features. An implementation of our code is available online.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot classification abilities, demonstrating great potential for generating weakly supervised labels. Unfortunately, existing weakly supervised learning methods are short of ability in generating accurate labels via VLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised labeling setting, namely True-False Labels (TFLs) which can achieve high accuracy when generated by VLMs. The TFL indicates whether an instance belongs to the label, which is randomly and uniformly sampled from the candidate label set. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator to explore and utilize the conditional probability distribution information of TFLs. Besides, we propose a convolutional-based Multi-modal Prompt Retrieving (MRP) method to bridge the gap between the knowledge of VLMs and target learning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TFL setting and MRP learning method. The code to reproduce the experiments is at https://github.com/Tranquilxu/TMP.

<title>Achieving Dimension-Free Communication in Federated Learning via Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising framework for collaborative and privacy-preserving machine learning across distributed data sources. However, the substantial communication costs associated with FL significantly challenge its efficiency. Specifically, in each communication round, the communication costs scale linearly with the model's dimension, which presents a formidable obstacle, especially in large model scenarios. Despite various communication-efficient strategies, the intrinsic dimension-dependent communication cost remains a major bottleneck for current FL implementations. This paper proposes a novel dimension-free communication algorithm - DeComFL, which leverages the zeroth-order optimization techniques and reduces the communication cost from $\mathscr{O}(d)$ to $\mathscr{O}(1)$ by transmitting only a constant number of scalar values between clients and the server in each round, regardless of the dimension $d$ of the model parameters. Theoretically, in non-convex functions, we prove that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art rates, which show a linear speedup of the number of clients and local steps under standard assumptions. With additional low effective rank assumption, we can further show the convergence rate is independent of the model dimension $d$ as well. Empirical evaluations, encompassing both classic deep learning training and large language model fine-tuning, demonstrate significant reductions in communication overhead. Notably, DeComFL achieves this by transmitting only around 1MB of data in total between the server and a client to fine-tune a model with billions of parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZidongLiu/DeComFL.

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are deep probabilistic models that represent stochastic processes by conditioning their prior distributions on a set of context points. Despite their advantages in uncertainty estimation for complex distributions, NPs enforce parameterization coupling between the conditional prior model and the posterior model. We show that this coupling amounts to prior misspecification and revisit the NP objective to address this issue. More specifically, we propose R\'enyi Neural Processes (RNP), a method that replaces the standard KL divergence with the R\'enyi divergence, dampening the effects of the misspecified prior during posterior updates. We validate our approach across multiple benchmarks including regression and image inpainting tasks, and show significant performance improvements of RNPs in real-world problems. Our extensive experiments show consistently better log-likelihoods over state-of-the-art NP models.

Abstract: Generative models based on dynamical equations such as flows and diffusions offer exceptional sample quality, but require computationally expensive numerical integration during inference. The advent of consistency models has enabled efficient one-step or few-step generation, yet despite their practical success, a systematic understanding of their design has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework. Here we introduce Flow Map Matching (FMM), a principled framework for learning the two-time flow map of an underlying dynamical generative model, thereby providing this missing mathematical foundation. Leveraging stochastic interpolants, we propose training objectives both for distillation from a pre-trained velocity field and for direct training of a flow map over an interpolant or a forward diffusion process. Theoretically, we show that FMM unifies and extends a broad class of existing approaches for fast sampling, including consistency models, consistency trajectory models, and progressive distillation. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-32 highlight that our approach can achieve sample quality comparable to flow matching while reducing generation time by a factor of 10-20.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a balanced multi-component and multi-layer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features, in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multi-component approach, in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multi-layer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multi-component structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.

Abstract: Data imputation and data generation have important applications for many domains, like healthcare and finance, where incomplete or missing data can hinder accurate analysis and decision-making. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become the standard method for enhancing the quality of conditional diffusion models. However, employing CFG requires either training an unconditional model alongside the main diffusion model or modifying the training procedure by periodically inserting a null condition. There is also no clear extension of CFG to unconditional models. In this paper, we revisit the core principles of CFG and introduce a new method, independent condition guidance (ICG), which provides the benefits of CFG without the need for any special training procedures. Our approach streamlines the training process of conditional diffusion models and can also be applied during inference on any pre-trained conditional model. Additionally, by leveraging the time-step information encoded in all diffusion networks, we propose an extension of CFG, called time-step guidance (TSG), which can be applied to any diffusion model, including unconditional ones. Our guidance techniques are easy to implement and have the same sampling cost as CFG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICG matches the performance of standard CFG across various conditional diffusion models. Moreover, we show that TSG improves generation quality in a manner similar to CFG, without relying on any conditional information.

Abstract: Existing methods for graph out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization primarily rely on empirical studies on synthetic datasets. Such approaches tend to overemphasize the causal relationships between invariant sub-graphs and labels, thereby neglecting the non-negligible role of environment in real-world scenarios. In contrast to previous studies that impose rigid independence assumptions on environments and invariant sub-graphs, this paper presents the theorems of environment-label dependency and mutable rationale invariance, where the former characterizes the usefulness of environments in determining graph labels while the latter refers to the mutable importance of graph rationales. Based on analytic investigations, a novel variational inference based method named ``Probability Dependency on Environments and Rationales for OOD Graphs on Real-world Data'' (DEROG) is introduced. To alleviate the adverse effect of unknown prior knowledge on environments and rationales, DEROG utilizes generalized Bayesian inference. Further, DEROG employs an EM-based algorithm for optimization. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets under different distribution shifts are conducted to show the superiority of DEROG.

Abstract: Graph mining has become crucial in fields such as social science, finance, and cybersecurity. Many large-scale real-world networks exhibit both heterogeneity, where multiple node and edge types exist in the graph, and heterophily, where connected nodes may have dissimilar labels and attributes. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on either heterophilic homogeneous graphs or homophilic heterogeneous graphs, leaving a significant gap in understanding how models perform on graphs with both heterogeneity and heterophily. To bridge this gap, we introduce H2GB, a large-scale node-classification graph benchmark that brings together the complexities of both the heterophily and heterogeneity properties of real-world graphs. H2GB encompasses 9 real-world datasets spanning 5 diverse domains, 28 baseline models, and a unified benchmarking library with a standardized data loader, evaluator, unified modeling framework, and an extensible framework for reproducibility. We establish a standardized workflow supporting both model selection and development, enabling researchers to easily benchmark graph learning methods. Extensive experiments across 28 baselines reveal that current methods struggle with heterophilic and heterogeneous graphs, underscoring the need for improved approaches. Finally, we present a new variant of the model, H2G-former, developed following our standardized workflow, that excels at this challenging benchmark. Both the benchmark and the framework are publicly available at Github and PyPI, with documentation hosted at https://junhongmit.github.io/H2GB.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have been shown effective to generate combinatorial objects with desired properties. We here propose a new GFlowNet training framework, with policy-dependent rewards, that bridges keeping flow balance of GFlowNets to optimizing the expected accumulated reward in traditional Reinforcement-Learning (RL). This enables the derivation of new policy-based GFlowNet training methods, in contrast to existing ones resembling value-based RL. It is known that the design of backward policies in GFlowNet training affects efficiency. We further develop a coupled training strategy that jointly solves GFlowNet forward policy training and backward policy design. Performance analysis is provided with a theoretical guarantee of our policy-based GFlowNet training. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets verify that our policy-based strategies provide advanced RL perspectives for robust gradient estimation to improve GFlowNet performance.

Abstract: The robustness of neural networks is crucial in safety-critical applications, where identifying a reliable input space is essential for effective model selection, robustness evaluation, and the development of reliable control strategies. Most existing robustness verification methods assess the worst-case output under the assumption that the input space is known. However, precisely identifying a verifiable input space \(\mathcal{C}\), where no adversarial examples exist, is challenging due to the possible high dimensionality, discontinuity, and non-convex nature of the input space. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, **LEVIS**, consisting of **LEVIS-{\alpha}** and **LEVIS-\b{eta}**. **LEVIS-{\alpha}** identifies a single, large verifiable ball that intersects at least two boundaries of a bounded region \(\mathcal{C}\), while **LEVIS-\b{eta}** systematically captures the entirety of the verifiable space by integrating multiple verifiable balls. Our contributions include: (1) introducing a verification framework that uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) to compute nearest and directional adversarial points, (2) integrating complementarity-constrained (CC) optimization with a reduced MIP formulation for scalability, achieving up to a 6 times runtime reduction, (3) theoretically characterizing the properties of the verifiable balls obtained by **LEVIS-{\alpha}**, and (4) validating the approach across applications including electrical power flow regression and image classification, with demonstrated performance gains and geometric insights into the verifiable region.

Abstract: In recent years, advancements in deep learning have spurred the development of numerous models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, most existing approaches struggle to fully capture the complex and structured dependencies inherent in time series data. In this work, we identify and formally define three critical dependencies that are fundamental to forecasting accuracy: order dependency and semantic dependency along the temporal dimension, as well as cross-variate dependency across the feature dimension. These dependencies are often treated in isolation, and improper handling can introduce noise and degrade forecasting performance. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential of State Space Models (SSMs) for LTSF and emphasize their inherent advantages in capturing these essential dependencies. Additionally, we empirically observe that excessive nonlinearity in conventional SSMs introduce redundancy when applied to semantically sparse time series data. Motivated by this insight, we propose SDE (Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding), a novel framework designed to enhance the capability of SSMs for LTSF. Specifically, we first eliminate unnecessary nonlinearities in vanilla SSMs, thereby improving the suitability for time series forecasting. Building on this foundation, we introduce a disentangled encoding strategy, which empowers SSMs to efficiently model cross-variate dependencies while mitigating interference between the temporal and feature dimensions. Furthermore, we provide rigorous theoretical justifications to substantiate our design choices. Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDE-enhanced SSMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art time series forecasting models.Our code is available at https://github.com/YukinoAsuna/SAMBA.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has revolutionized bioinformatics and driven progress in the understanding and prediction of the properties of biomolecules. To date, most biosequence transformers have been trained on a single omic-either proteins or nucleic acids and have seen incredible success in downstream tasks in each domain with particularly noteworthy breakthroughs in protein structural modeling. However, single-omic pre-training limits the ability of these models to capture cross-modal interactions. Here we present OmniBioTE, the largest open-source multi-omic model trained on over 250 billion tokens of mixed protein and nucleic acid data. We show that despite only being trained on unlabelled sequence data, OmniBioTE learns joint representations consistent with the central dogma of molecular biology. We further demonstrate that OmbiBioTE achieves state-of-the-art results predicting the change in Gibbs free energy ({\Delta}G) of the binding interaction between a given nucleic acid and protein. Remarkably, we show that multi-omic biosequence transformers emergently learn useful structural information without any a priori structural training, allowing us to predict which protein residues are most involved in the protein-nucleic acid binding interaction. Lastly, compared to single-omic controls trained with identical compute, OmniBioTE demonstrates superior performance-per-FLOP and absolute accuracy across both multi-omic and single-omic benchmarks, highlighting the power of a unified modeling approach for biological sequences.

Abstract: The Smart Grid (SG) is a critical energy infrastructure that collects real-time electricity usage data to forecast future energy demands using information and communication technologies (ICT). Due to growing concerns about data security and privacy in SGs, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising training framework. FL offers a balance between privacy, efficiency, and accuracy in SGs by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data from IoT devices. In this survey, we thoroughly review recent advancements in designing FL-based SG systems across three stages: generation, transmission and distribution, and consumption. Additionally, we explore potential vulnerabilities that may arise when implementing FL in these stages. Furthermore, we discuss the gap between state-of-the-art (SOTA) FL research and its practical applications in SGs, and we propose future research directions. Unlike traditional surveys addressing security issues in centralized machine learning methods for SG systems, this survey is the first to specifically examine the applications and security concerns unique to FL-based SG systems. We also introduce FedGridShield, an open-source framework featuring implementations of SOTA attack and defense methods. Our aim is to inspire further research into applications and improvements in the robustness of FL-based SG systems.

Abstract: When solving inverse problems, one increasingly popular approach is to use pre-trained diffusion models as plug-and-play priors. This framework can accommodate different forward models without re-training while preserving the generative capability of diffusion models. Despite their success in many imaging inverse problems, most existing methods rely on privileged information such as derivative, pseudo-inverse, or full knowledge about the forward model. This reliance poses a substantial limitation that restricts their use in a wide range of problems where such information is unavailable, such as in many scientific applications. We propose Ensemble Kalman Diffusion Guidance (EnKG), a derivative-free approach that can solve inverse problems by only accessing forward model evaluations and a pre-trained diffusion model prior. We study the empirical effectiveness of EnKG across various inverse problems, including scientific settings such as inferring fluid flows and astronomical objects, which are highly non-linear inverse problems that often only permit black-box access to the forward model. We open-source our code at https://github.com/devzhk/enkg-pytorch.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is crucial for improving both generation quality and alignment between the input condition and final output in diffusion models. While a high guidance scale is generally required to enhance these aspects, it also causes oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we revisit the CFG update rule and introduce modifications to address this issue. We first decompose the update term in CFG into parallel and orthogonal components with respect to the conditional model prediction and observe that the parallel component primarily causes oversaturation, while the orthogonal component enhances image quality. Accordingly, we propose down-weighting the parallel component to achieve high-quality generations without oversaturation. Additionally, we draw a connection between CFG and gradient ascent and introduce a new rescaling and momentum method for the CFG update rule based on this insight. Our approach, termed adaptive projected guidance (APG), retains the quality-boosting advantages of CFG while enabling the use of higher guidance scales without oversaturation. APG is easy to implement and introduces practically no additional computational overhead to the sampling process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that APG is compatible with various conditional diffusion models and samplers, leading to improved FID, recall, and saturation scores while maintaining precision comparable to CFG, making our method a superior plug-and-play alternative to standard classifier-free guidance.

Abstract: Model heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL). In scenarios with diverse model architectures, directly aggregating model parameters is impractical, leading HtFL methods to incorporate an extra objective alongside the original local objective on each client to facilitate collaboration. However, this often results in a mismatch between the extra and local objectives. To resolve this, we propose Federated Learning-to-Guide (FedL2G), a method that adaptively learns to guide local training in a federated manner, ensuring the added objective aligns with each client's original goal. With theoretical guarantees, FedL2G utilizes only first-order derivatives w.r.t. model parameters, achieving a non-convex convergence rate of O(1/T). We conduct extensive experiments across two data heterogeneity and six model heterogeneity settings, using 14 heterogeneous model architectures (e.g., CNNs and ViTs). The results show that FedL2G significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing (RS) is popular for providing certified robustness guarantees against adversarial attacks. The average certified radius (ACR) has emerged as a widely used metric for tracking progress in RS. However, in this work, for the first time we show that ACR is a poor metric for evaluating robustness guarantees provided by RS. We theoretically prove not only that a trivial classifier can have arbitrarily large ACR, but also that ACR is extremely sensitive to improvements on easy samples. In addition, the comparison using ACR has a strong dependence on the certification budget. Empirically, we confirm that existing training strategies, though improving ACR, reduce the model's robustness on hard samples consistently. To strengthen our findings, we propose strategies, including explicitly discarding hard samples, reweighing the dataset with approximate certified radius, and extreme optimization for easy samples, to replicate the progress in RS training and even achieve the state-of-the-art ACR on CIFAR-10, without training for robustness on the full data distribution. Overall, our results suggest that ACR has introduced a strong undesired bias to the field, and its application should be discontinued in RS. Finally, we suggest using the empirical distribution of $p_A$, the accuracy of the base model on noisy data, as an alternative metric for RS.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a recent technique for decomposing neural network activations into human-interpretable features. However, in order for SAEs to identify all features represented in frontier models, it will be necessary to scale them up to very high width, posing a computational challenge. In this work, we introduce Switch Sparse Autoencoders, a novel SAE architecture aimed at reducing the compute cost of training SAEs. Inspired by sparse mixture of experts models, Switch SAEs route activation vectors between smaller "expert" SAEs, enabling SAEs to efficiently scale to many more features. We present experiments comparing Switch SAEs with other SAE architectures, and find that Switch SAEs deliver a substantial Pareto improvement in the reconstruction vs. sparsity frontier for a given fixed training compute budget. We also study the geometry of features across experts, analyze features duplicated across experts, and verify that Switch SAE features are as interpretable as features found by other SAE architectures.

Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships into machine learning models has attracted significant attention, as it enhances generalization from limited data and leads to conforming outputs. However, most existing approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through regularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction, especially on inputs far from the training distribution -- an essential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand, imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a practical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy hard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that modify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with hard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, HardNet is the first method with an efficient forward pass to enforce more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet is expressive and retains the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of HardNet across various applications: learning with piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers with guaranteed feasibility, and optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict the loss of a target machine learning model by extrapolating from easier-to-train models with fewer parameters or smaller training sets. This provides an efficient way for practitioners and researchers alike to compare pretraining decisions involving optimizers, datasets, and model architectures. Despite the widespread use of scaling laws to model the dynamics of language model training, there has been little work on understanding how to best estimate and interpret them. We collect (and release) a large-scale dataset containing losses and downstream evaluations for 485 previously published pretrained models. We use these to estimate more than 1000 scaling laws, then derive a set of best practices for estimating scaling laws in new model families. We find that fitting scaling laws to intermediate checkpoints of training runs (and not just their final losses) substantially improves accuracy, and that -- all else equal -- estimates of performance are generally most accurate when derived from other models of similar sizes. However, because there is a significant degree of variability across model seeds, training multiple small models is sometimes more useful than training a single large one. Moreover, while different model families differ scaling behavior, they are often similar enough that a target model's behavior can be predicted from a single model with the same architecture, along with scaling parameter estimates derived from other model families.

Abstract: The number of publicly available models is rapidly increasing, yet most remain undocumented. Users looking for suitable models for their tasks must first determine what each model does. Training machine learning models to infer missing documentation directly from model weights is challenging, as these weights often contain significant variation unrelated to model functionality (denoted nuisance). Here, we identify a key property of real-world models: most public models belong to a small set of Model Trees, where all models within a tree are fine-tuned from a common ancestor (e.g., a foundation model). Importantly, we find that within each tree there is less nuisance variation between models. Concretely, while learning across Model Trees requires complex architectures, even a linear classifier trained on a single model layer often works within trees. While effective, these linear classifiers are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with larger models that have many parameters. To address this, we introduce Probing Experts (ProbeX), a theoretically motivated and lightweight method. Notably, ProbeX is the first probing method specifically designed to learn from the weights of a single hidden model layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbeX by predicting the categories in a model's training dataset based only on its weights. Excitingly, ProbeX can map the weights of Stable Diffusion into a weight-language embedding space, enabling model search via text, i.e., zero-shot model classification.

Abstract: We study the placement of virtual functions aimed at minimizing the cost. We propose a novel algorithm, using ideas based on multi-armed bandits. We prove that these algorithms learn the optimal placement policy rapidly, and their regret grows at a rate at most $O( N M \sqrt{T\ln T} )$ while respecting the feasibility constraints with high probability, where $T$ is total time slots, $M$ is the number of classes of function and $N$ is the number of computation nodes. We show through numerical experiments that the proposed algorithm both has good practical performance and modest computational complexity. We propose an acceleration technique that allows the algorithm to achieve good performance also in large networks where computational power is limited. Our experiments are fully reproducible, and the code is publicly available.

<title>Adversarial Inception Backdoor Attacks against Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the vulnerability of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms against training-time, backdoor poisoning attacks. The objectives of these attacks are twofold: induce pre-determined, adversarial behavior in the agent upon observing a fixed trigger during deployment while allowing the agent to solve its intended task during training. Prior attacks assume arbitrary control over the agent's rewards, inducing values far outside the environment's natural constraints. This results in brittle attacks that fail once the proper reward constraints are enforced. Thus, in this work we propose a new class of backdoor attacks against DRL which are the first to achieve state of the art performance under strict reward constraints. These "inception" attacks manipulate the agent's training data -- inserting the trigger into prior observations and replacing high return actions with those of the targeted adversarial behavior. We formally define these attacks and prove they achieve both adversarial objectives against arbitrary Markov Decision Processes (MDP). Using this framework we devise an online inception attack which achieves an 100\% attack success rate on multiple environments under constrained rewards while minimally impacting the agent's task performance.

Abstract: A central goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch Theorem states that we cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization without further assumptions, in practice we observe that simple models which explain the training data generalize best: a principle called Occam's razor. Despite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning only minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity through regularization or architecture design. Here, we draw a connection between Occam's razor and in-context learning: an emergent ability of certain sequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past observations in a sequence. In particular, we show that the next-token prediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a data compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this loss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity of the model that was implicitly learned from context. Our theory and the empirical experiments we use to support it not only provide a normative account of in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current in-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved. We make our code available at https://github.com/3rdCore/PrequentialCode.

<title>Beyond 2:4: exploring V:N:M sparsity for efficient transformer inference on GPUs</title>

Abstract: To date, 2:4 sparsity has stood as the only sparse pattern that can be accelerated using sparse tensor cores on GPUs. In practice, 2:4 sparsity often possesses low actual speedups ($\leq 1.3$) and requires fixed sparse ratios, meaning that other ratios, such as 4:8, 8:16, or those exceeding 50% sparsity, do not incur any speedups on GPUs. Recent studies suggest that V:N:M sparsity is promising in addressing these limitations of 2:4 sparsity. However, regarding accuracy, the effects of V:N:M sparsity on broader Transformer models, such as vision Transformers and large language models (LLMs), are largely unexamined. Moreover, Some specific issues related to V:N:M sparsity, such as how to select appropriate V and M values, remain unresolved. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the application of V:N:M sparsity in vision models and LLMs across multiple tasks, from pertaining to downstream tasks. We propose three key approaches to enhance the applicability and accuracy of V:N:M-sparse Transformers, including heuristic V and M selection, V:N:M-specific channel permutation, and three-staged LoRA training techniques. Experimental results show that, with our methods, the DeiT-small achieves lossless accuracy at 64:2:5 sparsity, while the DeiT-base maintains accuracy even at 64:2:8 sparsity. In addition, the fine-tuned LLama2-7B at 64:2:5 sparsity performs comparably or better than training-free 2:4 sparse alternatives on downstream tasks. More importantly, V:N:M-sparse Transformers offer a wider range of speedup-accuracy trade-offs compared to 2:4 sparsity. Overall, our exploration largely facilitates the V:N:M sparsity to act as a truly effective acceleration solution for Transformers in cost-sensitive inference scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread use of AI-generated content from diffusion models has raised significant concerns regarding misinformation and copyright infringement. Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency. The codes will be released at https://github.com/liwd190019/Shallow-Diffuse.

Abstract: The Privacy Preserving Federated Learning Document VQA (PFL-DocVQA) competition challenged the community to develop provably private and communication-efficient solutions in a federated setting for a real-life use case: invoice processing. The competition introduced a dataset of real invoice documents, along with associated questions and answers requiring information extraction and reasoning over the document images. Thereby, it brings together researchers and expertise from the document analysis, privacy, and federated learning communities. Participants fine-tuned a pre-trained, state-of-the-art Document Visual Question Answering model provided by the organizers for this new domain, mimicking a typical federated invoice processing setup. The base model is a multi-modal generative language model, and sensitive information could be exposed through either the visual or textual input modality. Participants proposed elegant solutions to reduce communication costs while maintaining a minimum utility threshold in track 1 and to protect all information from each document provider using differential privacy in track 2. The competition served as a new testbed for developing and testing private federated learning methods, simultaneously raising awareness about privacy within the document image analysis and recognition community. Ultimately, the competition analysis provides best practices and recommendations for successfully running privacy-focused federated learning challenges in the future.

Abstract: Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use \change{spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions}, to map observational time series to latent representations. \change{Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability.} Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer remarkable capabilities, yet their high inference costs restrict wider adoption. While increasing parameter counts improves accuracy, it also broadens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a hardware-aware framework that accelerates the inference of LLMs while preserving their capabilities. Using neural architecture search (NAS) at a large-scale, Puzzle optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization.
  We showcase our framework's impact via Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B) and Llama-3.3-Nemotron-49B, two publicly available models derived from Llama-70B-Instruct. Both models achieve a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while retaining 98.4% of the original model's benchmark accuracies. These are the most accurate models supporting single H100 GPU inference with large batch sizes, despite training on 45B tokens at most, far fewer than the 15T used to train Llama-70B. Lastly, we show that lightweight alignment on these derived models allows them to surpass the parent model in specific capabilities. Our work establishes that powerful LLM models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible loss in quality, underscoring that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection.

Abstract: Optimal prompt selection is crucial for maximizing large language model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks, especially in black-box settings where models are only accessible via APIs. Black-box prompt selection is challenging due to potentially large, combinatorial search spaces, absence of gradient information, and high evaluation cost of prompts on a validation set. We propose HbBoPs, a novel method that combines a structural-aware deep kernel Gaussian Process with Hyperband as a multi-fidelity scheduler to efficiently select prompts. HbBoPs uses embeddings of instructions and few-shot exemplars, treating them as modular components within prompts. This enhances the surrogate model's ability to predict which prompt to evaluate next in a sample-efficient manner. Hyperband improves query-efficiency by adaptively allocating resources across different fidelity levels, reducing the number of validation instances required for evaluating prompts. Extensive experiments across ten diverse benchmarks and three LLMs demonstrate that HbBoPs outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Given a semi-structured knowledge base (SKB), where text documents are interconnected by relations, how can we effectively retrieve relevant information to answer user questions? Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves documents to assist large language models (LLMs) in question answering; while Graph RAG (GRAG) uses structured knowledge bases as its knowledge source. However, many questions require both textual and relational information from SKB - referred to as "hybrid" questions - which complicates the retrieval process and underscores the need for a hybrid retrieval method that leverages both information. In this paper, through our empirical analysis, we identify key insights that show why existing methods may struggle with hybrid question answering (HQA) over SKB. Based on these insights, we propose HybGRAG for HQA consisting of a retriever bank and a critic module, with the following advantages: (1) Agentic, it automatically refines the output by incorporating feedback from the critic module, (2) Adaptive, it solves hybrid questions requiring both textual and relational information with the retriever bank, (3) Interpretable, it justifies decision making with intuitive refinement path, and (4) Effective, it surpasses all baselines on HQA benchmarks. In experiments on the STaRK benchmark, HybGRAG achieves significant performance gains, with an average relative improvement in Hit@1 of 51%.

Abstract: We propose Exemplar-Condensed federated class-incremental learning (ECoral) to distil the training characteristics of real images from streaming data into informative rehearsal exemplars. The proposed method eliminates the limitations of exemplar selection in replay-based approaches for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in federated continual learning (FCL). The limitations particularly related to the heterogeneity of information density of each summarized data. Our approach maintains the consistency of training gradients and the relationship to past tasks for the summarized exemplars to represent the streaming data compared to the original images effectively. Additionally, our approach reduces the information-level heterogeneity of the summarized data by inter-client sharing of the disentanglement generative model. Extensive experiments show that our ECoral outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and can be seamlessly integrated with many existing approaches to enhance performance.

Abstract: Graph generation is a critical task in numerous domains, including molecular design and social network analysis, due to its ability to model complex relationships and structured data. While most modern graph generative models utilize adjacency matrix representations, this work revisits an alternative approach that represents graphs as sequences of node set and edge set. We advocate for this approach due to its efficient encoding of graphs and propose a novel representation. Based on this representation, we introduce the Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer (G2PT), an auto-regressive model that learns graph structures via next-token prediction. To further exploit G2PT's capabilities as a general-purpose foundation model, we explore fine-tuning strategies for two downstream applications: goal-oriented generation and graph property prediction. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets. Results indicate that G2PT achieves superior generative performance on both generic graph and molecule datasets. Furthermore, G2PT exhibits strong adaptability and versatility in downstream tasks from molecular design to property prediction. Code available at https://github.com/tufts-ml/G2PT,

<title>"Cause" is Mechanistic Narrative within Scientific Domains: An Ordinary Language Philosophical Critique of "Causal Machine Learning"</title>

Abstract: Causal Learning has emerged as a major theme of research in statistics and machine learning in recent years, promising specific computational techniques to apply to datasets that reveal the true nature of cause and effect in a number of important domains. In this paper we consider the epistemology of recognizing true cause and effect phenomena. We apply the Ordinary Language method of engaging on the customary use of the word 'cause' to investigate valid semantics of reasoning about cause and effect. We recognize that the grammars of cause and effect are fundamentally distinct in form across scientific domains, yet they maintain a consistent and central function. This function can best be described as the mechanism underlying fundamental forces of influence as considered prominent in the respective scientific domain. We demarcate 1) physics and engineering as domains wherein mathematical models are sufficient to comprehensively describe causality, 2) biology as introducing challenges of emergence while providing opportunities for showing consistent mechanisms across scale, and 3) the social sciences as introducing grander difficulties for establishing models of low prediction error but providing, through Hermeneutics, the potential for findings that are still instrumentally useful to individuals. We posit that definitive causal claims regarding a given phenomenon (writ large) can only come through an agglomeration of consistent evidence across multiple domains. This presents important methodological questions as far as harmonizing between language games and emergence across scales. Given the role of epistemic hubris in the contemporary crisis of credibility in the sciences, exercising greater caution as far as communicating precision as to the real degree of certainty certain evidence provides for rich collections of open problems in optimizing integration of different findings.

<title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Switching Rewards and History Dependency for Characterizing Animal Behaviors</title>

Abstract: Traditional approaches to studying decision-making in neuroscience focus on simplified behavioral tasks where animals perform repetitive, stereotyped actions to receive explicit rewards. While informative, these methods constrain our understanding of decision-making to short timescale behaviors driven by explicit goals. In natural environments, animals exhibit more complex, long-term behaviors driven by intrinsic motivations that are often unobservable. Recent works in time-varying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aim to capture shifting motivations in long-term, freely moving behaviors. However, a crucial challenge remains: animals make decisions based on their history, not just their current state. To address this, we introduce SWIRL (SWitching IRL), a novel framework that extends traditional IRL by incorporating time-varying, history-dependent reward functions. SWIRL models long behavioral sequences as transitions between short-term decision-making processes, each governed by a unique reward function. SWIRL incorporates biologically plausible history dependency to capture how past decisions and environmental contexts shape behavior, offering a more accurate description of animal decision-making. We apply SWIRL to simulated and real-world animal behavior datasets and show that it outperforms models lacking history dependency, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This work presents the first IRL model to incorporate history-dependent policies and rewards to advance our understanding of complex, naturalistic decision-making in animals.

Abstract: While Large Language Models require more and more data to train and scale, rather than looking for any data to acquire, we should consider what types of tasks are more likely to benefit from data scaling. We should be intentional in our data acquisition. We argue that the shape of the data itself, such as its compositional and structural patterns, informs which tasks to prioritize in data scaling, and shapes the development of the next generation of compute paradigms for tasks where data scaling is inefficient, or even insufficient.

Abstract: Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (Asynchronous SGD) is a cornerstone method for parallelizing learning in distributed machine learning. However, its performance suffers under arbitrarily heterogeneous computation times across workers, leading to suboptimal time complexity and inefficiency as the number of workers scales. While several Asynchronous SGD variants have been proposed, recent findings by Tyurin & Richt\'arik (NeurIPS 2023) reveal that none achieve optimal time complexity, leaving a significant gap in the literature. In this paper, we propose Ringmaster ASGD, a novel Asynchronous SGD method designed to address these limitations and tame the inherent challenges of Asynchronous SGD. We establish, through rigorous theoretical analysis, that Ringmaster ASGD achieves optimal time complexity under arbitrarily heterogeneous and dynamically fluctuating worker computation times. This makes it the first Asynchronous SGD method to meet the theoretical lower bounds for time complexity in such scenarios.

Abstract: Early detection of patient deterioration is essential for timely treatment, with vital signs like heart rates being key health indicators. Existing methods tend to solely analyze vital sign waveforms, ignoring transition relationships of waveforms within each vital sign and the correlation strengths among various vital signs. Such studies often overlook nuanced illness deterioration, which is the early sign of worsening health but is difficult to detect. In this paper, we introduce CAND, a novel method that organizes the transition relationships and the correlations within and among vital signs as domain-specific and cross-domain knowledge. CAND jointly models these knowledge in a unified representation space, considerably enhancing the early detection of nuanced illness deterioration. In addition, CAND integrates a Bayesian inference method that utilizes augmented knowledge from domain-specific and cross-domain knowledge to address the ambiguities in correlation strengths. With this architecture, the correlation strengths can be effectively inferred to guide joint modeling and enhance representations of vital signs. This allows a more holistic and accurate interpretation of patient health. Our experiments on a real-world ICU dataset demonstrate that CAND significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and earliness in detecting nuanced illness deterioration. Moreover, we conduct a case study for the interpretable detection process to showcase the practicality of CAND.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has proven effective for parameter-efficient adaptation of pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks by inserting task-specific learnable prompt tokens. Despite its empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of VPT remains an active area of research. Building on the recently established connection between Mixture of Experts (MoE) and prompt-based methods, wherein each attention head can be conceptualized as a composition of multiple MoE models, we reinterpret VPT as the introduction of new prompt experts into these MoE structures. We identify a key limitation in existing VPT frameworks: the restricted functional expressiveness of prompt experts, which remain static and thus limited in their adaptability. To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompt Tuning (VAPT), a novel method that endows prompt experts with enhanced expressiveness while preserving parameter efficiency. Empirical evaluations on VTAB-1K and FGVC demonstrate that VAPT achieves substantial performance improvements, surpassing fully fine-tuned baselines by 7.34% and 1.04%, respectively. Moreover, VAPT consistently outperforms VPT while requiring fewer additional parameters. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis indicates that VAPT achieves optimal sample efficiency. Collectively, these results underscore the theoretical grounding and empirical advantages of our approach.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of large language models to adversarial attacks, where adversaries craft specific input sequences to induce harmful, violent, private, or incorrect outputs. In this work, we study their worst-case robustness, i.e., whether an adversarial example exists that leads to such undesirable outputs. We upper bound the worst-case robustness using stronger white-box attacks, indicating that most current deterministic defenses achieve nearly 0\% worst-case robustness. We propose a general tight lower bound for randomized smoothing using fractional knapsack solvers or 0-1 knapsack solvers, and using them to bound the worst-case robustness of all stochastic defenses. Based on these solvers, we provide theoretical lower bounds for several previous empirical defenses. For example, we certify the robustness of a specific case, smoothing using a uniform kernel, against \textit{any possible attack} with an average $\ell_0$ perturbation of 2.02 or an average suffix length of 6.41.

Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used tool for dimension reduction and denoising. Therefore, it is also widely used on the data prior to training a neural network. However, this approach can complicate the explanation of explainable AI (XAI) methods for the decision of the model. In this work, we analyze the potential issues with this approach and propose Principal Components-based Initialization (PCsInit), a strategy to incorporate PCA into the first layer of a neural network via initialization of the first layer in the network with the principal components, and its two variants PCsInit-Act and PCsInit-Sub. Explanations using these strategies are as direct and straightforward as for neural networks and are simpler than using PCA prior to training a neural network on the principal components. Moreover, as will be illustrated in the experiments, such training strategies can also allow further improvement of training via backpropagation.

Abstract: As privacy concerns and data regulations grow, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. However, a significant challenge in FL is that client data are often non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed), leading to reduced performance compared to centralized learning. While many methods have been proposed to address this issue, their underlying mechanisms are often viewed from different perspectives. Through a comprehensive investigation from gradient descent to FL, and from IID to non-IID data settings, we find that inconsistencies in client loss landscapes primarily cause performance degradation in non-IID scenarios. From this understanding, we observe that existing methods can be grouped into two main strategies: (i) adjusting parameter update paths and (ii) modifying client loss landscapes. These findings offer a clear perspective on addressing non-IID challenges in FL and help guide future research in the field.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities across various tasks but also pose risks by generating harmful content. Existing safety mechanisms, while improving model safety, often lead to overly cautious behavior and fail to fully leverage LLMs' internal cognitive processes. Inspired by humans' reflective thinking capability, we first show that LLMs can similarly perform internal assessments about safety in their internal states. Building on this insight, we propose SafeSwitch, a dynamic framework that regulates unsafe outputs by utilizing the prober-based internal state monitor that actively detects harmful intentions, and activates a safety head that leads to safer and more conservative responses only when necessary. SafeSwitch reduces harmful outputs by approximately 80% on harmful queries while maintaining strong utility, reaching a Pareto optimal among several methods. Our method is also advantageous over traditional methods in offering more informative, context-aware refusals, and achieves these benefits while only tuning less than 6% of the original parameters. SafeSwitch demonstrates large language models' capacity for self-awareness and reflection regarding safety, offering a promising approach to more nuanced and effective safety controls. Codes for this work are available at https://github.com/Hanpx20/SafeSwitch.

Abstract: Contextual linear dueling bandits have recently garnered significant attention due to their widespread applications in important domains such as recommender systems and large language models. Classical dueling bandit algorithms are typically only applicable to a single agent. However, many applications of dueling bandits involve multiple agents who wish to collaborate for improved performance yet are unwilling to share their data. This motivates us to draw inspirations from federated learning, which involves multiple agents aiming to collaboratively train their neural networks via gradient descent (GD) without sharing their raw data. Previous works have developed federated linear bandit algorithms which rely on closed-form updates of the bandit parameters (e.g., the linear function parameters) to achieve collaboration. However, in linear dueling bandits, the linear function parameters lack a closed-form expression and their estimation requires minimizing a loss function. This renders these previous methods inapplicable. In this work, we overcome this challenge through an innovative and principled combination of online gradient descent (OGD, for minimizing the loss function to estimate the linear function parameters) and federated learning, hence introducing our federated linear dueling bandit with OGD (FLDB-OGD) algorithm. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove that FLDB-OGD enjoys a sub-linear upper bound on its cumulative regret and demonstrate a theoretical trade-off between regret and communication complexity. We conduct empirical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of FLDB-OGD and reveal valuable insights, such as the benefit of a larger number of agents, the regret-communication trade-off, among others.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is highly resource-intensive due to their massive number of parameters and the overhead of optimizer states. While recent work has aimed to reduce memory consumption, such efforts often entail trade-offs among memory efficiency, training time, and model performance. Yet, true democratization of LLMs requires simultaneous progress across all three dimensions. To this end, we propose SubTrack++ that leverages Grassmannian gradient subspace tracking combined with projection-aware optimizers, enabling Adam's internal statistics to adapt to changes in the optimization subspace. Additionally, employing recovery scaling, a technique that restores information lost through low-rank projections, further enhances model performance. Our method demonstrates SOTA convergence by exploiting Grassmannian geometry and achieves lowest evaluation loss, outperforming the current SOTA while reducing pretraining wall time by 43% and maintaining the memory footprint on a 1B-parameter Llama model.

Abstract: Fire safety is crucial for ensuring the stability of building structures, yet evaluating whether a structure meets fire safety requirement is challenging. Fires can originate at any point within a structure, and simulating every potential fire scenario is both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) and an efficient machine learning framework for its identification. The MFSP is defined as the location at which a fire, if initiated, would cause the most severe detrimental impact on the building's stability, effectively representing the worst-case fire scenario. In our framework, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) serves as an efficient and differentiable agent for conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulators by predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) under fire, which then guides the training and evaluation of the MFSP predictor. Additionally, we enhance our framework with a novel edge update mechanism and a transfer learning-based training scheme. Evaluations on a large-scale simulation dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed framework in identifying the MFSP, offering a transformative tool for optimizing fire safety assessments in structural design. All developed datasets and codes are open-sourced online.

Abstract: Conditional generation models for longitudinal sequences can generate new or modified trajectories given a conditioning input. While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based generative models achieve remarkable results by training on massive datasets, yet this practice raises concerns about memorization and copyright infringement. A proposed remedy is to train exclusively on noisy data with potential copyright issues, ensuring the model never observes original content. However, through the lens of deconvolution theory, we show that although it is theoretically feasible to learn the data distribution from noisy samples, the practical challenge of collecting sufficient samples makes successful learning nearly unattainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose to pretrain the model with a small fraction of clean data to guide the deconvolution process. Combined with our Stochastic Forward--Backward Deconvolution (SFBD) method, we attain FID 6.31 on CIFAR-10 with just 4% clean images (and 3.58 with 10%). We also provide theoretical guarantees that SFBD learns the true data distribution. These results underscore the value of limited clean pretraining, or pretraining on similar datasets. Empirical studies further validate and enrich our findings.

Abstract: Many commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) are often closed-source, limiting developers to prompt tuning for aligning content generation with specific applications. While these models currently do not provide access to token logits, we argue that if such access were available, it would enable more powerful adaptation techniques beyond prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose a token-level probability reweighting framework that, given access to logits and a small amount of task-specific data, can effectively steer black-box LLMs toward application-specific content generation. Our approach views next-token prediction through the lens of supervised classification. We show that aligning black-box LLMs with task-specific data can be formulated as a label noise correction problem, leading to Plugin model -- an autoregressive probability reweighting model that operates solely on logits. We provide theoretical justification for why reweighting logits alone is sufficient for task adaptation. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets, LLMs, and reweighting models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, advocating for broader access to token logits in closed-source models.

Abstract: The scaling of model and data sizes has reshaped the AI landscape, establishing finetuning pretrained models as the standard paradigm for solving downstream tasks. However, dominant finetuning methods typically rely on weight adaptation, often lack interpretability, and depend on heuristically chosen hyperparameters. In this paper, we take a different perspective and shift the focus from weights to activation functions, viewing them through the lens of spline operators. We propose Curvature Tuning (CT), an interpretable and principled steering method that modulates a model's decision boundary by injecting a single hyperparameter into its activation functions. We show that CT provably adjusts model decision boundary curvature and, more fundamentally, projects a model onto a space of smooth functions-thereby complementing current finetuning methods, whose effect lies primarily in feature adaptation. Making this hyperparameter trainable gives rise to a novel and highly parameter-efficient finetuning method. Empirically, CT improves both generalization and robustness. For example, it boosts downstream accuracy of ResNet-50/152 by 7.14%/8.46% over linear probing and 4.64%/1.70% over LoRA across 12 datasets, and improves robust accuracy on the $\ell_\infty$ benchmark from RobustBench by 1032.64%/1494.46%.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard approach for fine-tuning large foundation models. However, our theoretical understanding of LoRA remains limited as prior analyses of LoRA's training dynamics either rely on linearization arguments or consider highly simplified setups. In this work, we analyze the LoRA loss landscape without such restrictive assumptions. We define two regimes: a "special regime", which includes idealized setups where linearization arguments hold, and a "generic regime" representing more realistic setups where linearization arguments do not hold. In the generic regime, we show that LoRA training converges to a global minimizer with low rank and small magnitude, or a qualitatively distinct solution with high rank and large magnitude. Finally, we argue that the zero-initialization and weight decay in LoRA training induce an implicit bias toward the low-rank, small-magnitude region of the parameter space -- where global minima lie -- thus shedding light on why LoRA training usually succeeds in finding global minima.

Abstract: Self-attention is essential to Transformer architectures, yet how information is embedded in the self-attention matrices and how different objective functions impact this process remains unclear. We present a mathematical framework to analyze self-attention matrices by deriving the structures governing their weight updates. Using this framework, we demonstrate that bidirectional training induces symmetry in the weight matrices, while autoregressive training results in directionality and column dominance. Our theoretical findings are validated across multiple Transformer models - including ModernBERT, GPT, LLaMA3, and Mistral - and input modalities like text, vision, and audio. Finally, we apply these insights by showing that symmetric initialization improves the performance of encoder-only models on language tasks. This mathematical analysis offers a novel theoretical perspective on how information is embedded through self-attention, thereby improving the interpretability of Transformer models.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Alignment (MOA) aims to align LLMs' responses with multiple human preference objectives, with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) emerging as a prominent approach. However, we find that DPO-based MOA approaches suffer from widespread preference conflicts in the data, where different objectives favor different responses. This results in conflicting optimization directions, hindering the optimization on the Pareto Front. To address this, we propose to construct Pareto-optimal responses to resolve preference conflicts. To efficiently obtain and utilize such responses, we propose a self-improving DPO framework that enables LLMs to self-generate and select Pareto-optimal responses for self-supervised preference alignment. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the superior Pareto Front achieved by our framework compared to various baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/zyttt-coder/SIPO.

Abstract: In this paper we establish a new margin-based generalization bound for voting classifiers, refining existing results and yielding tighter generalization guarantees for widely used boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1997). Furthermore, the new margin-based generalization bound enables the derivation of an optimal weak-to-strong learner: a Majority-of-3 large-margin classifiers with an expected error matching the theoretical lower bound. This result provides a more natural alternative to the Majority-of-5 algorithm by (H{\o}gsgaard et al., 2024), and matches the Majority-of-3 result by (Aden-Ali et al., 2024) for the realizable prediction model.

<title>Armijo Line-search Can Make (Stochastic) Gradient Descent Provably Faster</title>

Abstract: Armijo line-search (Armijo-LS) is a standard method to set the step-size for gradient descent (GD). For smooth functions, Armijo-LS alleviates the need to know the global smoothness constant L and adapts to the ``local'' smoothness, enabling GD to converge faster. Existing theoretical analyses show that GD with Armijo-LS (GD-LS) can result in constant factor improvements over GD with a 1/L step-size (denoted as GD(1/L)). We strengthen these results and show that if the objective function satisfies a certain non-uniform smoothness condition, GD-LS can result in a faster convergence rate than GD(1/L). In particular, we prove that for convex objectives corresponding to logistic regression and multi-class classification, GD-LS can converge to the optimum at a linear rate, and hence improves over the sublinear convergence of GD(1/L). Furthermore, for non-convex objectives satisfying gradient domination (e.g., those corresponding to the softmax policy gradient in RL or generalized linear models with a logistic link function), GD-LS can match the fast convergence of algorithms tailored for these specific settings. Finally, we prove that under the interpolation assumption, for convex losses, stochastic GD with a stochastic line-search can match the fast convergence of GD-LS

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising generative capabilities across diverse domains, yet aligning their outputs with desired reward functions remains a challenge, particularly in cases where reward functions are non-differentiable. Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: As autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in open and uncertain settings, there is a growing need for trustworthy world models that can reliably predict future high-dimensional observations. The learned latent representations in world models lack direct mapping to meaningful physical quantities and dynamics, limiting their utility and interpretability in downstream planning, control, and safety verification. In this paper, we argue for a fundamental shift from physically informed to physically interpretable world models - and crystallize four principles that leverage symbolic knowledge to achieve these ends: (1) functionally organizing the latent space according to the physical intent, (2) learning aligned invariant and equivariant representations of the physical world, (3) integrating multiple forms and strengths of supervision into a unified training process, and (4) partitioning generative outputs to support scalability and verifiability. We experimentally demonstrate the value of each principle on two benchmarks. This paper opens several intriguing research directions to achieve and capitalize on full physical interpretability in world models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in slow thinking reasoning models have shown exceptional performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, these models often exhibit overthinking (generating redundant reasoning steps for simple problems), leading to excessive computational resource usage. While current mitigation strategies uniformly reduce reasoning tokens, they risk degrading performance on challenging tasks that require extended reasoning. This paper introduces Difficulty-Adaptive Slow Thinking (DAST), a novel framework that enables models to autonomously adjust the length of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on problem difficulty. We first propose a Token Length Budget (TLB) metric to quantify difficulty, then leverage budget-aware reward shaping and budget preference optimization to implement DAST. DAST penalizes overlong responses for simple tasks while incentivizing sufficient reasoning for complex problems. Experiments on diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that DAST effectively mitigates overthinking (reducing token usage by over 30\% on average) while preserving reasoning accuracy on complex problems.

<title>Adversarial Policy Optimization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning is based on pre-collected preference feedback over pairs of trajectories. While offline PbRL has demonstrated remarkable empirical success, existing theoretical approaches face challenges in ensuring conservatism under uncertainty, requiring computationally intractable confidence set constructions. We address this limitation by proposing Adversarial Preference-based Policy Optimization (APPO), a computationally efficient algorithm for offline PbRL that guarantees sample complexity bounds without relying on explicit confidence sets. By framing PbRL as a two-player game between a policy and a model, our approach enforces conservatism in a tractable manner. Using standard assumptions on function approximation and bounded trajectory concentrability, we derive a sample complexity bound. To our knowledge, APPO is the first offline PbRL algorithm to offer both statistical efficiency and practical applicability. Experimental results on continuous control tasks demonstrate that APPO effectively learns from complex datasets, showing comparable performance with existing state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Slim attention: cut your context memory in half without loss -- K-cache is all you need for MHA</title>

Abstract: Slim attention shrinks the context memory size by 2x for transformer models with MHA (multi-head attention), which can speed up inference by up to 2x for large context windows.
  Slim attention is an exact, mathematically identical implementation of the standard attention mechanism and therefore doesn't compromise model accuracy. In other words, slim attention losslessly compresses the context memory by a factor of 2.
  For encoder-decoder transformers, the context memory size can be reduced even further: For the Whisper models for example, slim attention reduces the context memory by 8x, which can speed up token generation by 5x for batch size 64 for example.
  And for the T5-11B model for example, the memory can be reduced by 32x because its MHA projection dimension is larger than the embedding dimension.

Abstract: Continual learning algorithms aim to learn from a sequence of tasks, making the training distribution non-stationary. The majority of existing continual learning approaches in the literature rely on heuristics and do not provide learning guarantees. In this paper, we present a new method called Continual Pick-to-Learn (CoP2L), which is able to retain the most representative samples for each task in an efficient way. CoP2L combines the Pick-to-Learn algorithm (rooted in the sample compression theory) and the experience replay continual learning scheme. This allows us to provide non-vacuous upper bounds on the generalization loss of the learned predictors, numerically computable after each task. We empirically evaluate our approach on several standard continual learning benchmarks across Class-Incremental, Task-Incremental, and Domain-Incremental settings. Our results show that CoP2L is highly competitive across all setups, often outperforming existing baselines, and significantly mitigating catastrophic forgetting compared to vanilla experience replay in the Class-Incremental setting. It is possible to leverage the bounds provided by CoP2L in practical scenarios to certify the predictor reliability on previously learned tasks, in order to improve the trustworthiness of the continual learning algorithm.

<title>We Should Chart an Atlas of All the World's Models</title>

Abstract: Public model repositories now contain millions of models, yet most models remain undocumented and effectively lost. In this position paper, we advocate for charting the world's model population in a unified structure we call the Model Atlas: a graph that captures models, their attributes, and the weight transformations that connect them. The Model Atlas enables applications in model forensics, meta-ML research, and model discovery, challenging tasks given today's unstructured model repositories. However, because most models lack documentation, large atlas regions remain uncharted. Addressing this gap motivates new machine learning methods that treat models themselves as data, inferring properties such as functionality, performance, and lineage directly from their weights. We argue that a scalable path forward is to bypass the unique parameter symmetries that plague model weights. Charting all the world's models will require a community effort, and we hope its broad utility will rally researchers toward this goal.

<title>Unique Hard Attention: A Tale of Two Sides</title>

Abstract: Understanding the expressive power of transformers has recently attracted attention, as it offers insights into their abilities and limitations. Many studies analyze unique hard attention transformers, where attention selects a single position that maximizes the attention scores. When multiple positions achieve the maximum score, either the rightmost or the leftmost of those is chosen. In this paper, we highlight the importance of this seeming triviality. Recently, finite-precision transformers with both leftmost- and rightmost-hard attention were shown to be equivalent to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show that this no longer holds with only leftmost-hard attention -- in that case, they correspond to a \emph{strictly weaker} fragment of LTL. Furthermore, we show that models with leftmost-hard attention are equivalent to \emph{soft} attention, suggesting they may better approximate real-world transformers than right-attention models. These findings refine the landscape of transformer expressivity and underscore the role of attention directionality.

Abstract: Partially observable environments present a considerable computational challenge in reinforcement learning due to the need to consider long histories. Learning with a finite window of observations quickly becomes intractable as the window length grows. In this work, we introduce memory traces. Inspired by eligibility traces, these are compact representations of the history of observations in the form of exponential moving averages. We prove sample complexity bounds for the problem of offline on-policy evaluation that quantify the return errors achieved with memory traces for the class of Lipschitz continuous value estimates. We establish a close connection to the window approach, and demonstrate that, in certain environments, learning with memory traces is significantly more sample efficient. Finally, we underline the effectiveness of memory traces empirically in online reinforcement learning experiments for both value prediction and control.

Abstract: There have been many attempts to leverage multiple diffusion models for collaborative generation, extending beyond the original domain. A prominent approach involves synchronizing multiple diffusion trajectories by mixing the estimated scores to artificially correlate the generation processes. However, existing methods rely on naive heuristics, such as averaging, without considering task specificity. These approaches do not clarify why such methods work and often produce suboptimal results when a heuristic suitable for one task is blindly applied to others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework for analyzing why diffusion synchronization works and reveal where heuristics should be focused; modeling correlations between multiple trajectories and adapting them to each specific task. We further identify optimal correlation models per task, achieving better results than previous approaches that apply a single heuristic across all tasks without justification.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools with applications in computer vision and scientific machine learning (SciML), where they have been used to solve large-scale probabilistic inverse problems. Traditionally, these models have been derived using principles of variational inference, denoising, statistical signal processing, and stochastic differential equations. In contrast to the conventional presentation, in this study we derive diffusion models using ideas from linear partial differential equations and demonstrate that this approach has several benefits that include a constructive derivation of the forward and reverse processes, a unified derivation of multiple formulations and sampling strategies, and the discovery of a new class of variance preserving models. We also apply the conditional version of these models to solve canonical conditional density estimation problems and challenging inverse problems. These problems help establish benchmarks for systematically quantifying the performance of different formulations and sampling strategies in this study and for future studies. Finally, we identify and implement a mechanism through which a single diffusion model can be applied to measurements obtained from multiple measurement operators. Taken together, the contents of this manuscript provide a new understanding of and several new directions in the application of diffusion models to solving physics-based inverse problems.

Abstract: Multimodal data are often incomplete and exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics in real-world scenarios. These inherent limitations lead to both modality heterogeneity through partial modality absence and data heterogeneity from distribution divergence, creating fundamental challenges for effective federated learning (FL). To address these coupled challenges, we propose FedRecon, the first method targeting simultaneous missing modality reconstruction and Non-IID adaptation in multimodal FL. Our approach first employs a lightweight Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) to reconstruct missing modalities while preserving cross-modal consistency. Distinct from conventional imputation methods, we achieve sample-level alignment through a novel distribution mapping mechanism that guarantees both data consistency and completeness. Additionally, we introduce a strategy employing global generator freezing to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which in turn mitigates Non-IID fluctuations. Extensive evaluations on multimodal datasets demonstrate FedRecon's superior performance in modality reconstruction under Non-IID conditions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models has raised environmental and economic concerns about their intensity of resource usage during inference. Serving these models to each user requires substantial energy and water for cooling. Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large language models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential performance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available method relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's accuracy degradation by 10.85\% and 7.54\% respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in general vision-language tasks. However, recent studies have exposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This deficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to interact effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader applications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally emerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies. Instead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental modifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper, we first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the context of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world applications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components of the current methodology, from training data to reasoning mechanisms, influence spatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations while simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work aims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet underexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we seek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: We introduce a novel generative framework for functions by integrating Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Transformer-based hypernetworks into latent variable models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on MLP-based hypernetworks with scalability limitations, our method employs a Transformer-based decoder to generate INR parameters from latent variables, addressing both representation capacity and computational efficiency. Our framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation by replacing standard decoders with a Transformer-based hypernetwork, which can be trained either from scratch or via hyper-transforming: a strategy that fine-tunes only the decoder while freezing the pre-trained latent space. This enables efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without requiring full retraining. We validate our approach across multiple modalities, demonstrating improved scalability, expressiveness, and generalization over existing INR-based generative models. Our findings establish a unified and flexible framework for learning structured function representations.

Abstract: Real-world datasets often follow a long-tailed distribution, making generalization to tail classes difficult. Recent methods resorted to long-tail variants of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), such as ImbSAM and CC-SAM, to improve generalization by flattening the loss landscape. However, these attempts face a trade-off between computational efficiency and control over the loss landscape. On the one hand, ImbSAM is efficient but offers only coarse control as it excludes head classes from the SAM process. On the other hand, CC-SAM provides fine-grained control through class-dependent perturbations but at the cost of efficiency due to multiple backpropagations. Seeing this dilemma, we introduce Focal-SAM, which assigns different penalties to class-wise sharpness, achieving fine-grained control without extra backpropagations, thus maintaining efficiency. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze Focal-SAM's generalization ability and derive a sharper generalization bound. Extensive experiments on both traditional and foundation models validate the effectiveness of Focal-SAM.

Abstract: Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains. The code is available at https://github.com/langfengQ/CoSo.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model by minimizing the divergence between their output distributions, typically using forward Kullback-Leibler divergence (FKLD) or reverse KLD (RKLD). It has become an effective training paradigm due to the broader supervision information provided by the teacher distribution compared to one-hot labels. We identify that the core challenge in KD lies in balancing two mode-concentration effects: the \textbf{\textit{Hardness-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on modes with large errors, and the \textbf{\textit{Confidence-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on modes with high student confidence. Through an analysis of how probabilities are reassigned during gradient updates, we observe that these two effects are entangled in FKLD and RKLD, but in extreme forms. Specifically, both are too weak in FKLD, causing the student to fail to concentrate on the target class. In contrast, both are too strong in RKLD, causing the student to overly emphasize the target class while ignoring the broader distributional information from the teacher. To address this imbalance, we propose ABKD, a generic framework with $\alpha$-$\beta$-divergence. Our theoretical results show that ABKD offers a smooth interpolation between FKLD and RKLD, achieving an effective trade-off between these effects. Extensive experiments on 17 language/vision datasets with 12 teacher-student settings confirm its efficacy. The code is available at https://github.com/ghwang-s/abkd.

Abstract: We introduce Dialz, a framework for advancing research on steering vectors for open-source LLMs, implemented in Python. Steering vectors allow users to modify activations at inference time to amplify or weaken a 'concept', e.g. honesty or positivity, providing a more powerful alternative to prompting or fine-tuning. Dialz supports a diverse set of tasks, including creating contrastive pair datasets, computing and applying steering vectors, and visualizations. Unlike existing libraries, Dialz emphasizes modularity and usability, enabling both rapid prototyping and in-depth analysis. We demonstrate how Dialz can be used to reduce harmful outputs such as stereotypes, while also providing insights into model behaviour across different layers. We release Dialz with full documentation, tutorials, and support for popular open-source models to encourage further research in safe and controllable language generation. Dialz enables faster research cycles and facilitates insights into model interpretability, paving the way for safer, more transparent, and more reliable AI systems.

<title>Learning Soft Sparse Shapes for Efficient Time-Series Classification</title>

Abstract: Shapelets are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time series classification. Due to the time-intensive nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a Soft sparse Shapes (SoftShape) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.

Abstract: Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR), which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic \textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy \textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set. Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under high noise levels.

Abstract: Currently, the scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces challenges and bottlenecks. This paper posits that noise effects, stemming from changes in the signal-to-noise ratio under diminishing marginal returns, are the root cause of these issues. To control this noise, we investigated the differences between models with performance advantages and disadvantages, introducing the concept of "relative overfitting." Based on their complementary strengths, we have proposed an application framework, Accept-Reject (AR), and the associated AR Law, which operates within this framework to elucidate the patterns of performance changes after model integration. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), we use LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) as the medium for discussion. This framework enables SLMs to exert a universal positive influence on LLM decision outputs, rather than the intuitively expected potential negative influence. We validated our approach using self-built models based on mainstream architectures and pre-trained mainstream models across multiple datasets, including basic language modeling, long-context tasks, subject examination, and question-answering (QA) benchmarks. The results demonstrate that through our framework, compared to increasing the LLM's parameters, we can achieve better performance improvements with significantly lower parameter and computational costs in many scenarios. These improvements are universal, stable, and effective. Furthermore, we explore the potential of "relative overfitting" and the AR framework in other machine learning domains, such as computer vision (CV) and AI for science. We hope the proposed approach can help scale laws overcome existing bottlenecks.

<title>A Dataless Reinforcement Learning Approach to Rounding Hyperplane Optimization for Max-Cut</title>

Abstract: The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying densities and degree distributions.

Abstract: Plausible counterfactual explanations (p-CFEs) are perturbations that minimally modify inputs to change classifier decisions while remaining plausible under the data distribution. In this study, we demonstrate that classifiers can be trained on p-CFEs labeled with induced \emph{incorrect} target classes to classify unperturbed inputs with the original labels. While previous studies have shown that such learning is possible with adversarial perturbations, we extend this paradigm to p-CFEs. Interestingly, our experiments reveal that learning from p-CFEs is even more effective: the resulting classifiers achieve not only high in-distribution accuracy but also exhibit significantly reduced bias with respect to spurious correlations.

Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function, has been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. More recently, it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen & Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2, outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

Abstract: Smishing, or SMS-based phishing, poses an increasing threat to mobile users by mimicking legitimate communications through culturally adapted, concise, and deceptive messages, which can result in the loss of sensitive data or financial resources. In such, we present a multi-channel smishing detection model that combines country-specific semantic tagging, structural pattern tagging, character-level stylistic cues, and contextual phrase embeddings. We curated and relabeled over 84,000 messages across five datasets, including 24,086 smishing samples. Our unified architecture achieves 97.89% accuracy, an F1 score of 0.963, and an AUC of 99.73%, outperforming single-stream models by capturing diverse linguistic and structural cues. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-signal learning in robust and region-aware phishing.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.

Abstract: The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.

Abstract: Model merging dramatically reduces storage and computational resources by combining multiple expert models into a single multi-task model. Although recent model merging methods have shown promising results, they struggle to maintain performance gains as the number of merged models increases. In this paper, we investigate the key obstacles that limit the scalability of model merging when integrating a large number of expert models. First, we prove that there is an upper bound on model merging. Further theoretical analysis reveals that the limited effective parameter space imposes a strict constraint on the number of models that can be successfully merged. Gaussian Width shows that the marginal benefit of merging additional models diminishes according to a strictly concave function. This implies that the effective parameter space becomes rapidly saturated as the number of merged models increases. Furthermore, using Approximate Kinematics Theory, we prove the existence of a unique optimal threshold beyond which adding more models does not yield significant performance improvements. At the same time, we introduce a straightforward Reparameterized Heavy-Tailed method (RHT) to extend the coverage of the merged model, thereby enhancing its performance. Empirical results on 12 benchmarks, including both knowledge-intensive and general-purpose tasks, validate our theoretical analysis. We believe that these results spark further research beyond the current scope of model merging. The source code is in the Github repository: https://github.com/wzj1718/ModelMergingAnalysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel neural network approach, termed DeepRTE, to address the steady-state Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). The RTE is a differential-integral equation that governs the propagation of radiation through a participating medium, with applications spanning diverse domains such as neutron transport, atmospheric radiative transfer, heat transfer, and optical imaging. Our DeepRTE framework demonstrates superior computational efficiency for solving the steady-state RTE, surpassing traditional methods and existing neural network approaches. This efficiency is achieved by embedding physical information through derivation of the RTE and mathematically-informed network architecture. Concurrently, DeepRTE achieves high accuracy with significantly fewer parameters, largely due to its incorporation of mechanisms such as multi-head attention. Furthermore, DeepRTE is a mesh-free neural operator framework with inherent zero-shot capability. This is achieved by incorporating Green's function theory and pre-training with delta-function inflow boundary conditions into both its architecture design and training data construction. The efficacy of the proposed approach is substantiated through comprehensive numerical experiments.

Abstract: Methods for automatic chemical retrosynthesis have found recent success through the application of models traditionally built for natural language processing, primarily through transformer neural networks. These models have demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5, and top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a strong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a variety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By constructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length prediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample from the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong metrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate that accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further boosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent impressive improvements in NLP, largely based on the success of contextual neural language models, have been mostly demonstrated on at most a couple dozen high-resource languages. Building language models and, more generally, NLP systems for non-standardized and low-resource languages remains a challenging task. In this work, we focus on North-African colloquial dialectal Arabic written using an extension of the Latin script, called NArabizi, found mostly on social media and messaging communication. In this low-resource scenario with data displaying a high level of variability, we compare the downstream performance of a character-based language model on part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing to that of monolingual and multilingual models. We show that a character-based model trained on only 99k sentences of NArabizi and fined-tuned on a small treebank of this language leads to performance close to those obtained with the same architecture pre-trained on large multilingual and monolingual models. Confirming these results a on much larger data set of noisy French user-generated content, we argue that such character-based language models can be an asset for NLP in low-resource and high language variability set-tings.

Abstract: Sampling a probability distribution with known likelihood is a fundamental task in computational science and engineering. Aiming at multimodality, we propose a new sampling method that takes advantage of both birth-death process and exploration component. The main idea of this method is look before you leap. We keep two sets of samplers, one at warmer temperature and one at original temperature. The former one serves as pioneer in exploring new modes and passing useful information to the other, while the latter one samples the target distribution after receiving the information. We derive a mean-field limit and show how the exploration component accelerates the sampling process. Moreover, we prove exponential asymptotic convergence under mild assumption. Finally, we test on experiments from previous literature and compare our methodology to previous ones.

Abstract: We study the scaling of classification error rates with respect to the size of the training dataset. In contrast to classical results where rates are minimax optimal for a problem class, this work starts with the empirical observation that, even for a fixed data distribution, the error scaling can have \emph{diverse} rates across different ranges of sample size. To understand when and why the error rate is non-uniform, we theoretically analyze nearest neighbor classifiers. We show that an error scaling law can have fine-grained rates: in the early phase, the test error depends polynomially on the data dimension and decreases fast; whereas in the later phase, the error depends exponentially on the data dimension and decreases slowly. Our analysis highlights the complexity of the data distribution in determining the test error. When the data are distributed benignly, we show that the generalization error of nearest neighbor classifier can depend polynomially, instead of exponentially, on the data dimension.

Abstract: Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) is increasing the scale and complexity of ransomware attacks. Understanding the internal operations behind RaaS has been a challenge due to the illegality of such activities. The recent chat leak of the Conti RaaS operator, one of the most infamous ransomware operators on the international scene, offers a key opportunity to better understand the inner workings of such organizations. This paper analyzes the main topic discussions in the Conti chat leak using machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), as well as visualization strategies. Five discussion topics are found: 1) Business, 2) Technical, 3) Internal tasking/Management, 4) Malware, and 5) Customer Service/Problem Solving. Moreover, the distribution of topics among Conti members shows that only 4% of individuals have specialized discussions while almost all individuals (96%) are all-rounders, meaning that their discussions revolve around the five topics. The results also indicate that a significant proportion of Conti discussions are non-tech related. This study thus highlights that running such large RaaS operations requires a workforce skilled beyond technical abilities, with individuals involved in various tasks, from management to customer service or problem solving. The discussion topics also show that the organization behind the Conti RaaS oper5086933ator shares similarities with a large firm. We conclude that, although RaaS represents an example of specialization in the cybercrime industry, only a few members are specialized in one topic, while the rest runs and coordinates the RaaS operation.

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of interacting with open-world environments to solve diverse tasks is a compelling challenge. However, evaluating such open-ended agents remains difficult, with current benchmarks facing scalability limitations. To address this, we introduce Minecraft Universe (MCU), a comprehensive evaluation framework set within the open-world video game Minecraft. MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks that encompasses 11 major categories and 41 subcategories of challenges; (2) a task composition mechanism capable of generating infinite diverse tasks with varying difficulty; and (3) a general evaluation framework that achieves 91.5\% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment.

Abstract: This paper studies density-based clustering of point sets. These methods use dense regions of points to detect clusters of arbitrary shapes. In particular, we study variants of density peaks clustering, a popular type of algorithm that has been shown to work well in practice. Our goal is to cluster large high-dimensional datasets, which are prevalent in practice. Prior solutions are either sequential, and cannot scale to large data, or are specialized for low-dimensional data.
  This paper unifies the different variants of density peaks clustering into a single framework, PECANN, by abstracting out several key steps common to this class of algorithms. One such key step is to find nearest neighbors that satisfy a predicate function, and one of the main contributions of this paper is an efficient way to do this predicate search using graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). To provide ample parallelism, we propose a doubling search technique that enables points to find an approximate nearest neighbor satisfying the predicate in a small number of rounds. Our technique can be applied to many existing graph-based ANNS algorithms, which can all be plugged into PECANN.
  We implement five clustering algorithms with PECANN and evaluate them on synthetic and real-world datasets with up to 1.28 million points and up to 1024 dimensions on a 30-core machine with two-way hyper-threading. Compared to the state-of-the-art FASTDP algorithm for high-dimensional density peaks clustering, which is sequential, our best algorithm is 45x-734x faster while achieving competitive ARI scores. Compared to the state-of-the-art parallel DPC-based algorithm, which is optimized for low dimensions, we show that PECANN is two orders of magnitude faster. As far as we know, our work is the first to evaluate DPC variants on large high-dimensional real-world image and text embedding datasets.

Abstract: The development and adoption of Vision Transformers and other deep-learning architectures for image classification tasks has been rapid. However, the "black box" nature of neural networks is a barrier to adoption in applications where explainability is essential. While some techniques for generating explanations have been proposed, primarily for Convolutional Neural Networks, adapting such techniques to the new paradigm of Vision Transformers is non-trivial. This paper presents T-TAME, Transformer-compatible Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations, a general methodology for explaining deep neural networks used in image classification tasks. The proposed architecture and training technique can be easily applied to any convolutional or Vision Transformer-like neural network, using a streamlined training approach. After training, explanation maps can be computed in a single forward pass; these explanation maps are comparable to or outperform the outputs of computationally expensive perturbation-based explainability techniques, achieving SOTA performance. We apply T-TAME to three popular deep learning classifier architectures, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, trained on the ImageNet dataset, and we demonstrate improvements over existing state-of-the-art explainability methods. A detailed analysis of the results and an ablation study provide insights into how the T-TAME design choices affect the quality of the generated explanation maps.

Abstract: We point out that (continuous or discontinuous) piecewise linear functions on a convex polytope mesh can be represented by two-hidden-layer ReLU neural networks in a weak sense. In addition, the numbers of neurons of the two hidden layers required to weakly represent are accurately given based on the numbers of polytopes and hyperplanes involved in this mesh. The results naturally hold for constant and linear finite element functions. Such weak representation establishes a bridge between shallow ReLU neural networks and finite element functions, and leads to a perspective for analyzing approximation capability of ReLU neural networks in $L^p$ norm via finite element functions. Moreover, we discuss the strict representation for tensor finite element functions via the recent tensor neural networks.

<title>Learning WENO for entropy stable schemes to solve conservation laws</title>

Abstract: Entropy conditions play a crucial role in the extraction of a physically relevant solution for systems of conservation laws, thus motivating the construction of entropy stable schemes that satisfy a discrete analogue of such conditions. TeCNO schemes (Fjordholm et al. 2012) form a class of arbitrary high-order entropy stable finite difference solvers, which require specialized reconstruction algorithms satisfying the sign property at each cell interface. Third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes called SP-WENO (Fjordholm and Ray, 2016) and SP-WENOc (Ray, 2018) have been designed to satisfy the sign property. However, these WENO algorithms can perform poorly near shocks, with the numerical solutions exhibiting large spurious oscillations. In the present work, we propose a variant of the SP-WENO, termed as Deep Sign-Preserving WENO (DSP-WENO), where a neural network is trained to learn the WENO weighting strategy. The sign property and third-order accuracy are strongly imposed in the algorithm, which constrains the WENO weight selection region to a convex polygon. Thereafter, a neural network is trained to select the WENO weights from this convex region with the goal of improving the shock-capturing capabilities without sacrificing the rate of convergence in smooth regions. The proposed synergistic approach retains the mathematical framework of the TeCNO scheme while integrating deep learning to remedy the computational issues of the WENO-based reconstruction. We present several numerical experiments to demonstrate the significant improvement with DSP-WENO over the existing variants of WENO satisfying the sign property.

Abstract: Graph clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning with broad real-world applications. While spectral clustering methods for undirected graphs are well-established and guided by a minimum cut optimization consensus, their extension to directed graphs remains relatively underexplored due to the additional complexity introduced by edge directions. In this paper, we leverage statistical inference on stochastic block models to guide the development of a spectral clustering algorithm for directed graphs. Specifically, we study the maximum likelihood estimation under a widely used directed stochastic block model, and derive a global objective function that aligns with the underlying community structure. We further establish a theoretical upper bound on the misclustering error of its spectral relaxation, and based on this relaxation, introduce a novel, self-adaptive spectral clustering method for directed graphs. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over existing baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that lead to generation of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires a time-consuming search for adversarial prompts, whereas automatic adversarial prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that do not scale well. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses another LLM, called AdvPrompter, to generate human-readable adversarial prompts in seconds. AdvPrompter, which is trained using an alternating optimization algorithm, generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs show highly competitive results on the AdvBench and HarmBench datasets, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLMs. We also show that training on adversarial suffixes generated by AdvPrompter is a promising strategy for improving the robustness of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks.

Abstract: Gaussian processes are flexible probabilistic regression models which are widely used in statistics and machine learning. However, a drawback is their limited scalability to large data sets. To alleviate this, full-scale approximations (FSAs) combine predictive process methods and covariance tapering, thus approximating both global and local structures. We show how iterative methods can be used to reduce computational costs in calculating likelihoods, gradients, and predictive distributions with FSAs. In particular, we introduce a novel preconditioner and show theoretically and empirically that it accelerates the conjugate gradient method's convergence speed and mitigates its sensitivity with respect to the FSA parameters and the eigenvalue structure of the original covariance matrix, and we demonstrate empirically that it outperforms a state-of-the-art pivoted Cholesky preconditioner. Furthermore, we introduce an accurate and fast way to calculate predictive variances using stochastic simulation and iterative methods. In addition, we show how our newly proposed FITC preconditioner can also be used in iterative methods for Vecchia approximations. In our experiments, it outperforms existing state-of-the-art preconditioners for Vecchia approximations. All methods are implemented in a free C++ software library with high-level Python and R packages.

Abstract: Continuous-time approximation of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a crucial tool to study its escaping behaviors from stationary points. However, existing stochastic differential equation (SDE) models fail to fully capture these behaviors, even for simple quadratic objectives. Built on a novel stochastic backward error analysis framework, we derive the Hessian-Aware Stochastic Modified Equation (HA-SME), an SDE that incorporates Hessian information of the objective function into both its drift and diffusion terms. Our analysis shows that HA-SME achieves the order-best approximation error guarantee among existing SDE models in the literature, while significantly reducing the dependence on the smoothness parameter of the objective. Empirical experiments on neural network-based loss functions further validate this improvement. Further, for quadratic objectives, under mild conditions, HA-SME is proved to be the first SDE model that recovers exactly the SGD dynamics in the distributional sense. Consequently, when the local landscape near a stationary point can be approximated by quadratics, HA-SME provides a more precise characterization of the local escaping behaviors of SGD. With the enhanced approximation guarantee, we further conduct an escape time analysis using HA-SME, showcasing how it can be employed to analytically study the escaping behavior of SGD for general function classes.

Abstract: Teeth segmentation and recognition play a vital role in a variety of dental applications and diagnostic procedures. The integration of deep learning models has facilitated the development of precise and automated segmentation methods. Although prior research has explored teeth segmentation, not many methods have successfully performed tooth segmentation and detection simultaneously. This study presents UFBA-425, a dental dataset derived from the UFBA-UESC dataset, featuring bounding box and polygon annotations for 425 panoramic dental X-rays. Additionally, this work introduces OralBBNet, an architecture featuring distinct segmentation and detection heads as U-Net and YOLOv8, respectively. OralBBNet is designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of tooth classification and segmentation on panoramic X-rays by leveraging the complementary strengths of U-Net and YOLOv8. Our approach achieved a 1-3% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) for teeth detection compared to existing techniques and a 15-20% improvement in the dice score for teeth segmentation over U-Net over various tooth categories and 2-4% improvement in the dice score when compared with other segmentation architectures. The results of this study establish a foundation for the wider implementation of object detection models in dental diagnostics.

Abstract: A persistent challenge in sign language video processing, including the task of sign to written language translation, is how we learn representations of sign language in an effective and efficient way that preserves the important attributes of these languages, while remaining invariant to irrelevant visual differences. Informed by the nature and linguistics of signed languages, our proposed method focuses on just the most relevant parts in a signing video: the face, hands and body pose of the signer. However, instead of fully relying on pose estimation from off-the-shelf pose tracking models, which have inconsistent performance for hands and faces, we propose to learn a representation of the complex handshapes and facial expressions of sign languages in a self-supervised fashion. Our approach is based on learning from individual frames (rather than video sequences) and is therefore much more efficient than prior work on sign language pre-training. Compared to a recent model that established a new state of the art in sign language translation on the How2Sign dataset, our approach yields similar translation performance, using less than 3\% of the compute.

<title>eGAD! double descent is explained by Generalized Aliasing Decomposition</title>

arXiv:2408.08294v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an unknown function to predict values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics, predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counterintuitive behaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing generalization error. Others may exhibit more complicated patterns of predictive error with multiple peaks and valleys. Neither double descent nor multiple descent phenomena are well explained by the bias-variance decomposition.
  We introduce a novel decomposition that we call the generalized aliasing decomposition (GAD) to explain the relationship between predictive performance and model complexity. The GAD decomposes the predictive error into three parts: 1) model insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much smaller than the number of data points, 2) data insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much greater than the number of data points, and 3) generalized aliasing, which dominates between these two extremes.
  We demonstrate the applicability of the GAD to diverse applications, including random feature models from machine learning, Fourier transforms from signal processing, solution methods for differential equations, and predictive formation enthalpy in materials discovery. Because key components of the GAD can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing experiments. We further demonstrate this approach on several examples and discuss implications for predictive modeling and data science.

Abstract: In preparation for Higgs factories and energy-frontier facilities, future colliders are moving toward high-granularity calorimeters to improve reconstruction quality. However, the cost and construction complexity of such detectors is substantial, making software-based approaches like super-resolution an attractive alternative. This study explores integrating super-resolution techniques into an LHC-like reconstruction pipeline to effectively enhance calorimeter granularity and suppress noise. We find that this software preprocessing step significantly improves reconstruction quality without physical changes to the detector. To demonstrate its impact, we propose a novel transformer-based particle flow model that offers improved particle reconstruction quality and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that super-resolution can be readily applied at collider experiments.

Abstract: The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) capabilities is accompanied by a concerning rise in its misuse. In particular the generation of credible misinformation in the form of images poses a significant threat to the public trust in democratic processes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop tools to reliably distinguish between authentic and AI-generated content. The majority of detection methods are based on neural networks that are trained to recognize forensic artifacts. In this work, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples under real-world conditions. Through extensive experiments, comprising four detection methods and five attack algorithms, we show that an attacker can dramatically decrease classification performance, without internal knowledge of the detector's architecture. Notably, most attacks remain effective even when images are degraded during the upload to, e.g., social media platforms. In a case study, we demonstrate that these robustness challenges are also found in commercial tools by conducting black-box attacks on HIVE, a proprietary online GenAI media detector. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of using generated features of a robust pre-trained model and showed that this increases the robustness, while not reaching the performance on benign inputs. These results, along with the increasing potential of GenAI to erode public trust, underscore the need for more research and new perspectives on methods to prevent its misuse.

Abstract: Robust, diverse, and challenging cultural knowledge benchmarks are essential for measuring our progress towards making LMs that are helpful across diverse cultures. We introduce CulturalBench: a set of 1,696 human-written and human-verified questions to assess LMs' cultural knowledge, covering 45 global regions including underrepresented ones like Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Peru. Questions are each verified by five independent annotators and span 17 diverse topics ranging from food preferences to greeting etiquette. We construct CulturalBench using methods inspired by Human-AI Red-Teaming. Compared to human performance (92.4% accuracy), the hard version of CulturalBench is challenging even for the best-performing frontier LMs, ranging from 28.7% to 61.5% in accuracy. We find that LMs often struggle with tricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the Chinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to overfit to a single answer. Our results indicate that GPT-4o substantially outperform other models across cultures, besting local providers (e.g., Mistral on European culture and DeepSeek on Chinese culture). Across the board, models under-perform on questions related to North Africa, South America and Middle East.

Abstract: Compositionality is believed to be fundamental to intelligence. In humans, it underlies the structure of thought, language, and higher-level reasoning. In AI, compositional representations can enable a powerful form of out-of-distribution generalization, in which a model systematically adapts to novel combinations of known concepts. However, while we have strong intuitions about what compositionality is, we lack satisfying formal definitions for it that are measurable and mathematical. Here, we propose such a definition, which we call representational compositionality, that accounts for and extends our intuitions about compositionality. The definition is conceptually simple, quantitative, grounded in algorithmic information theory, and applicable to any representation. Intuitively, representational compositionality states that a compositional representation satisfies three properties. First, it must be expressive. Second, it must be possible to re-describe the representation as a function of discrete symbolic sequences with re-combinable parts, analogous to sentences in natural language. Third, the function that relates these symbolic sequences to the representation, analogous to semantics in natural language, must be simple. Through experiments on both synthetic and real world data, we validate our definition of compositionality and show how it unifies disparate intuitions from across the literature in both AI and cognitive science. We also show that representational compositionality, while theoretically intractable, can be readily estimated using standard deep learning tools. We hope that our definition can inspire the design of novel, theoretically-driven models that better capture the mechanisms of compositional thought. We make our code available at https://github.com/EricElmoznino/complexity_compositionality.

Abstract: Multimodal conversation, a crucial form of human communication, carries rich emotional content, making the exploration of the causes of emotions within it a research endeavor of significant importance. However, existing research on the causes of emotions typically employs an utterance selection method within a single textual modality to locate causal utterances. This approach remains limited to coarse-grained assessments, lacks nuanced explanations of emotional causation, and demonstrates inadequate capability in identifying multimodal emotional triggers. Therefore, we introduce a task-\textbf{Multimodal Emotion Cause Explanation in Conversation (MECEC)}. This task aims to generate a summary based on the multimodal context of conversations, clearly and intuitively describing the reasons that trigger a given emotion. To adapt to this task, we develop a new dataset (ECEM) based on the MELD dataset. ECEM combines video clips with detailed explanations of character emotions, helping to explore the causal factors behind emotional expression in multimodal conversations. A novel approach, FAME-Net, is further proposed, that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze visual data and accurately interpret the emotions conveyed through facial expressions in videos. By exploiting the contagion effect of facial emotions, FAME-Net effectively captures the emotional causes of individuals engaged in conversations. Our experimental results on the newly constructed dataset show that FAME-Net outperforms several excellent baselines. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/3222345200/FAME-Net.

arXiv:2411.04975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely adopted to reduce latency in large language model (LLM) inference by leveraging smaller draft models capable of handling diverse user tasks. However, emerging AI applications, such as LLM-based agents, present unique workload characteristics: instead of diverse independent requests, agentic frameworks typically submit repetitive inference requests, such as multi-agent pipelines performing similar subtasks or self-refinement loops iteratively enhancing outputs. These workloads result in long and highly predictable sequences, which current speculative decoding methods do not effectively exploit. To address this gap, we introduce \emph{SuffixDecoding}, a novel method that utilizes efficient suffix trees to cache long token sequences from prompts and previous outputs. By adaptively speculating more tokens when acceptance likelihood is high and fewer when it is low, SuffixDecoding effectively exploits opportunities for longer speculations while conserving computation when those opportunities are limited. Evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text-to-SQL, demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves speedups of up to 5.3$\times$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- 2.8$\times$ faster than model-based approaches like EAGLE-2/3 and 1.9$\times$ faster than model-free approaches such as Token Recycling. SuffixDecoding is open-sourced at https://github.com/snowflakedb/ArcticInference.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have seen significant performance improvements in recent years. However, due to their size and complexity, they function as black-boxes, leading to transparency concerns. State-of-the-art saliency methods generate local explanations that highlight the area in the input image where a class is identified but cannot explain how a concept of interest contributes to the prediction, which is essential for bias mitigation. On the other hand, concept-based methods, such as TCAV (Testing with Concept Activation Vectors), provide insights into how sensitive is the network to a concept, but cannot compute its attribution in a specific prediction nor show its location within the input image. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc explainability framework, Visual-TCAV, which aims to bridge the gap between these methods by providing both local and global explanations for CNN-based image classification. Visual-TCAV uses Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) to generate saliency maps that show where concepts are recognized by the network. Moreover, it can estimate the attribution of these concepts to the output of any class using a generalization of Integrated Gradients. This framework is evaluated on popular CNN architectures, with its validity further confirmed via experiments where ground truth for explanations is known, and a comparison with TCAV. Our code is available at https://github.com/DataSciencePolimi/Visual-TCAV.

Abstract: Company fundamentals are key to assessing companies' financial and overall success and stability. Forecasting them is important in multiple fields, including investing and econometrics. While statistical and contemporary machine learning methods have been applied to many time series tasks, there is a lack of comparison of these approaches on this particularly challenging data regime. To this end, we try to bridge this gap and thoroughly evaluate the theoretical properties and practical performance of 24 deterministic and probabilistic company fundamentals forecasting models on real company data. We observe that deep learning models provide superior forecasting performance to classical models, in particular when considering uncertainty estimation. To validate the findings, we compare them to human analyst expectations and find that their accuracy is comparable to the automatic forecasts. We further show how these high-quality forecasts can benefit automated stock allocation. We close by presenting possible ways of integrating domain experts to further improve performance and increase reliability.

<title>Offline Adaptation of Quadruped Locomotion using Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based approach to quadrupedal locomotion that simultaneously addresses the limitations of learning and interpolating between multiple skills and of (modes) offline adapting to new locomotion behaviours after training. This is the first framework to apply classifier-free guided diffusion to quadruped locomotion and demonstrate its efficacy by extracting goal-conditioned behaviour from an originally unlabelled dataset. We show that these capabilities are compatible with a multi-skill policy and can be applied with little modification and minimal compute overhead, i.e., running entirely on the robots onboard CPU. We verify the validity of our approach with hardware experiments on the ANYmal quadruped platform.

Abstract: We propose a general approach to optimize noise schedules for training and sampling in diffusion models. Our approach optimizes the noise schedules to ensure a constant rate of change in the probability distribution of diffused data throughout the diffusion process. Any distance metric for measuring the probability-distributional change is applicable to our approach, and we introduce three distance metrics. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach on unconditional and class-conditional image-generation tasks using the LSUN (Horse, Bedroom, Church), ImageNet, FFHQ, and CIFAR10 datasets. Through extensive experiments, we confirmed that our approach broadly improves the performance of pixel-space and latent-space diffusion models regardless of the dataset, sampler, and number of function evaluations ranging from 5 to 250. Notably, by using our approach for optimizing both training and sampling schedules, we achieved a state-of-the-art FID score of 2.03 without sacrificing mode coverage on LSUN Horse 256 $\times$ 256.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance rapidly, rigorous evaluation has become essential, providing further guidance for their development. In this work, we focus on a unified and robust evaluation of \textbf{vision perception} abilities, the foundational skill of MLLMs. We find that existing perception benchmarks, each focusing on different question types, domains, and evaluation metrics, introduce significant evaluation variance, complicating comprehensive assessments of perception abilities when relying on any single benchmark. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AbilityLens}, a unified benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in six key perception abilities (ranging from counting, OCR, to understanding structural data), focusing on both accuracy and stability, with each ability encompassing diverse types of questions, domains, and metrics. With the assistance of AbilityLens, we: (1) identify the strengths and weaknesses of current main-stream MLLMs, highlighting stability patterns and revealing a notable performance gap between state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models; (2) uncover interesting ability conflict and early convergence phenomena during MLLM training; (3) reveal the primary reason of ability conflict is data mixing ratio and LLM model size; and (4) discuss the effectiveness of some straightforward strategies \eg, fine-tuning and model merging, to solve the ability conflict. The benchmark and online leaderboard is released in https://github.com/Chenfeng1271/AbilityLens.

<title>Learnable Activation Functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>

Abstract: We investigate learnable activation functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), comparing traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed and trainable activations against Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that employ learnable basis functions. While PINNs effectively incorporate physical laws into the learning process, they suffer from convergence and spectral bias problems, which limit their applicability to problems with rapid oscillations or sharp transitions. In this work, we study and evaluate various activation and basis functions across diverse PDEs, including oscillatory, nonlinear wave, mixed-physics, and fluid dynamics problems. Using empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis and Hessian eigenvalue decomposition, we assess convergence behavior, stability, and high-frequency approximation capacity. While KANs offer improved expressivity for capturing complex, high-frequency PDE solutions, they introduce new optimization challenges, especially in deeper networks. Our findings show that KANs face a curse of functional dimensionality, creating intractable optimization landscapes in deeper networks. Low spectral bias alone does not guarantee good performance; adaptive spectral bias approaches such as B-splines achieve optimal results by balancing global stability with local high-frequency resolution. Different PDE types require tailored strategies: smooth global activation functions excel for wave phenomena, while local adaptive activation functions suit problems with sharp transitions.

<title>Likelihood-Scheduled Score-Based Generative Modeling for Fully 3D PET Image Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Medical image reconstruction with pre-trained score-based generative models (SGMs) has advantages over other existing state-of-the-art deep-learned reconstruction methods, including improved resilience to different scanner setups and advanced image distribution modeling. SGM-based reconstruction has recently been applied to simulated positron emission tomography (PET) datasets, showing improved contrast recovery for out-of-distribution lesions relative to the state-of-the-art. However, existing methods for SGM-based reconstruction from PET data suffer from slow reconstruction, burdensome hyperparameter tuning and slice inconsistency effects (in 3D). In this work, we propose a practical methodology for fully 3D reconstruction that accelerates reconstruction and reduces the number of critical hyperparameters by matching the likelihood of an SGM's reverse diffusion process to a current iterate of the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization algorithm. Using the example of low-count reconstruction from simulated [$^{18}$F]DPA-714 datasets, we show our methodology can match or improve on the NRMSE and SSIM of existing state-of-the-art SGM-based PET reconstruction while reducing reconstruction time and the need for hyperparameter tuning. We evaluate our methodology against state-of-the-art supervised and conventional reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate a first-ever implementation of SGM-based reconstruction for real 3D PET data, specifically [$^{18}$F]DPA-714 data, where we integrate perpendicular pre-trained SGMs to eliminate slice inconsistency issues.

<title>Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.

Abstract: Self-evolving trainin--where models iteratively learn from their own outputs--has emerged as a key approach for complex reasoning tasks, addressing the scarcity of high-quality chain-of-thought data. However, its effectiveness in multimodal reasoning, a domain more intricate than text-only reasoning, remains underexplored, and the understanding of critical factors in this training paradigm remains limited. Furthermore, a central challenge for this training method is performance saturation, which impedes further improvements and scalability. Inspired by reinforcement learning (RL), in this paper, we reframe self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning through the lens of RL, identifying three pivotal factors: Training Method, Reward Model, and Prompt Variation. Through systematic analysis, we establish relatively optimal design principles that significantly enhance multimodal reasoning capabilities. Moreover, delving deeper into training dynamics, we uncover the roots of saturation and propose a new automatic balancing mechanism to mitigate this limitation. Building on these insights, we propose M-STAR (Multimodal Self-evolving Training for Reasoning), a framework that achieves consistent performance gains across models of varying sizes and diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).

arXiv:2501.15781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new finetuning method to provide pre-trained large language models (LMs) the ability to scale test-time compute through the diffusion framework. By increasing the number of diffusion steps, we show our finetuned models achieve monotonically increasing accuracy, directly translating to improved performance across downstream tasks. Furthermore, our finetuned models can expertly answer questions on specific topics by integrating powerful guidance techniques, and autonomously determine the compute required for a given problem by leveraging adaptive ODE solvers. Our method is universally applicable to any foundation model pre-trained with a cross-entropy loss and does not modify any of its original weights, fully preserving its strong single-step generation capabilities. We show our method is more effective and fully compatible with traditional finetuning approaches, introducing an orthogonal new direction to unify the strengths of the autoregressive and diffusion frameworks.

<title>First-ish Order Methods: Hessian-aware Scalings of Gradient Descent</title>

Abstract: Gradient descent is the primary workhorse for optimizing large-scale problems in machine learning. However, its performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the learning rate. A key limitation of gradient descent is its lack of natural scaling, which often necessitates expensive line searches or heuristic tuning to determine an appropriate step size. In this paper, we address this limitation by incorporating Hessian information to scale the gradient direction. By accounting for the curvature of the function along the gradient, our adaptive, Hessian-aware scaling method ensures a local unit step size guarantee, even in nonconvex settings. Near a local minimum that satisfies the second-order sufficient conditions, our approach achieves linear convergence with a unit step size. We show that our method converges globally under a significantly weaker version of the standard Lipschitz gradient smoothness assumption. Even when Hessian information is inexact, the local unit step size guarantee and global convergence properties remain valid under mild conditions. Finally, we validate our theoretical results empirically on a range of convex and nonconvex machine learning tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach.

<title>On the query complexity of sampling from non-log-concave distributions</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a $d$-dimensional distribution with density $p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$, which does not necessarily satisfy good isoperimetric conditions.
  Specifically, we show that for any $L,M$ satisfying $LM\ge d\ge 5$, $\epsilon\in \left(0,\frac{1}{32}\right)$, and any algorithm with query accesses to the value of $f(x)$ and $\nabla f(x)$, there exists an $L$-log-smooth distribution with second moment at most $M$ such that the algorithm requires $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ queries to compute a sample whose distribution is within $\epsilon$ in total variation distance to the target distribution. We complement the lower bound with an algorithm requiring $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(d)}$ queries, thereby characterizing the tight (up to the constant in the exponent) query complexity for sampling from the family of non-log-concave distributions.
  Our results are in sharp contrast with the recent work of Huang et al. (COLT'24), where an algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity was proposed for sampling from a non-log-concave distribution when $M=\mathtt{poly}(d)$. Their algorithm works under the stronger condition that all distributions along the trajectory of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, starting from the target distribution, are $\mathcal{O}(1)$-log-smooth. We investigate this condition and prove that it is strictly stronger than requiring the target distribution to be $\mathcal O(1)$-log-smooth. Additionally, we study this condition in the context of mixtures of Gaussians.
  Finally, we place our results within the broader theme of ``sampling versus optimization'', as studied in Ma et al. (PNAS'19). We show that for a wide range of parameters, sampling is strictly easier than optimization by a super-exponential factor in the dimension $d$.

Abstract: Machine learning is a vital part of many real-world systems, but several concerns remain about the lack of interpretability, explainability and robustness of black-box AI systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) address some of these challenges by learning interpretable concepts from high-dimensional data, e.g. images, which are used to predict labels. An important issue in CBMs are spurious correlation between concepts, which effectively lead to learning "wrong" concepts. Current mitigating strategies have strong assumptions, e.g., they assume that the concepts are statistically independent of each other, or require substantial interaction in terms of both interventions and labels provided by annotators. In this paper, we describe a framework that provides theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the learned concepts and on the number of required labels, without requiring any interventions. Our framework leverages causal representation learning (CRL) methods to learn latent causal variables from high-dimensional observations in a unsupervised way, and then learns to align these variables with interpretable concepts with few concept labels. We propose a linear and a non-parametric estimator for this mapping, providing a finite-sample high probability result in the linear case and an asymptotic consistency result for the non-parametric estimator. We evaluate our framework in synthetic and image benchmarks, showing that the learned concepts have less impurities and are often more accurate than other CBMs, even in settings with strong correlations between concepts.

<title>How does ion temperature gradient turbulence depend on magnetic geometry? Insights from data and machine learning</title>

arXiv:2502.11657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic geometry has a significant effect on the level of turbulent transport in fusion plasmas. Here, we model and analyze this dependence using multiple machine learning methods and a dataset of > 200,000 nonlinear simulations of ion-temperature-gradient turbulence in diverse non-axisymmetric geometries. The dataset is generated using a large collection of both optimized and randomly generated stellarator equilibria. At fixed gradients, the turbulent heat flux varies between geometries by several orders of magnitude. Trends are apparent among the configurations with particularly high or low heat flux. Regression and classification techniques from machine learning are then applied to extract patterns in the dataset. Due to a symmetry of the gyrokinetic equation, the heat flux and regressions thereof should be invariant to translations of the raw features in the parallel coordinate, similar to translation invariance in computer vision applications. Multiple regression models including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and decision trees can achieve reasonable predictive power for the heat flux in held-out test configurations, with highest accuracy for the CNNs. Using Spearman correlation, sequential feature selection, and Shapley values to measure feature importance, it is consistently found that the most important geometric lever on the heat flux is the flux surface compression in regions of bad curvature. The second most important feature relates to the magnitude of geodesic curvature. These two features align remarkably with surrogates that have been proposed based on theory, while the methods here allow a natural extension to more features for increased accuracy. The dataset, released with this publication, may also be used to test other proposed surrogates, and we find many previously published proxies do correlate well with both the heat flux and stability boundary.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) tend to neglect image content and over-rely on language-model priors, resulting in errors in visually grounded tasks and hallucinations. We hypothesize that this issue arises because existing VLMs are not explicitly trained to generate texts that are accurately grounded in fine-grained image details. To enhance visual feedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward capturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text tokens. To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a paired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting visual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases involving Minimal Visual Contrasts. Experiments show that our method consistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering various abilities and domains, achieving up to a 22% reduction in hallucinations, and significant gains in vision-centric and general tasks. Notably, these improvements become increasingly pronounced in benchmarks with higher visual dependency. In short, S-VCO offers a significant enhancement of VLM's visually-dependent task performance while retaining or even improving the model's general abilities. We opensource our code at https://s-vco.github.io/

Abstract: Social reasoning abilities are crucial for AI systems to effectively interpret and respond to multimodal human communication and interaction within social contexts. We introduce SOCIAL GENOME, the first benchmark for fine-grained, grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models. SOCIAL GENOME contains 272 videos of interactions and 1,486 human-annotated reasoning traces related to inferences about these interactions. These traces contain 5,777 reasoning steps that reference evidence from visual cues, verbal cues, vocal cues, and external knowledge (contextual knowledge external to videos). SOCIAL GENOME is also the first modeling challenge to study external knowledge in social reasoning. SOCIAL GENOME computes metrics to holistically evaluate semantic and structural qualities of model-generated social reasoning traces. We demonstrate the utility of SOCIAL GENOME through experiments with state-of-the-art models, identifying performance gaps and opportunities for future research to improve the grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, Claude-Sonnet and Gemini-Thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking Claude-Sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively. Attention: This paper contains inappropriate, offensive and harmful content.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks but struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in their generated responses. This limitation makes it challenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily prompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response samples, which incurs high computational costs. Moreover, LLMs have been shown to be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their answers. In this work, we propose CoT-UQ, a response-wise UQ framework that integrates LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the UQ process. CoT-UQ captures critical information during inference by extracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to the final answer. This key reasoning information is then aggregated to produce a final uncertainty estimate. We conduct extensive experiments based on Llama Family with model sizes varying from 8B to 13B across logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-UQ significantly outperforms existing UQ methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.9% AUROC compared to current UQ methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) showcase increasingly impressive English benchmark scores, however their performance profiles remain inconsistent across multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce PolyPrompt, a novel, parameter-efficient framework for enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. Our method learns a set of trigger tokens for each language through a gradient-based search, identifying the input query's language and selecting the corresponding trigger tokens which are prepended to the prompt during inference. We perform experiments on two ~1 billion parameter models, with evaluations on the global MMLU benchmark across fifteen typologically and resource diverse languages, demonstrating accuracy gains of 3.7%-19.9% compared to naive and translation-pipeline baselines.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks, and prior research shows that CoT can theoretically increase expressiveness. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of the algorithms that Transformer+CoT can learn. Our key contributions are: (1) We evaluate the state tracking capabilities of Transformer+CoT and its variants, confirming the effectiveness of CoT. (2) Next, we identify the circuit (a subset of model components, responsible for tracking the world state), indicating that late-layer MLP neurons play a key role. We propose two metrics, compression and distinction, and show that the neuron sets for each state achieve nearly 100% accuracy, providing evidence of an implicit finite state automaton (FSA) embedded within the model. (3) Additionally, we explore three challenging settings: skipping intermediate steps, introducing data noises, and testing length generalization. Our results demonstrate that Transformer+CoT learns robust algorithms (FSAs), highlighting its resilience in challenging scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/IvanChangPKU/FSA.

Abstract: One of the most basic lower bounds in machine learning is that in nearly any nontrivial setting, it takes $\textit{at least}$ $1/\epsilon$ samples to learn to error $\epsilon$ (and more, if the classifier being learned is complex). However, suppose that data points are agents who have the ability to improve by a small amount if doing so will allow them to receive a (desired) positive classification. In that case, we may actually be able to achieve $\textit{zero}$ error by just being "close enough". For example, imagine a hiring test used to measure an agent's skill at some job such that for some threshold $\theta$, agents who score above $\theta$ will be successful and those who score below $\theta$ will not (i.e., learning a threshold on the line). Suppose also that by putting in effort, agents can improve their skill level by some small amount $r$. In that case, if we learn an approximation $\hat{\theta}$ of $\theta$ such that $\theta \leq \hat{\theta} \leq \theta + r$ and use it for hiring, we can actually achieve error zero, in the sense that (a) any agent classified as positive is truly qualified, and (b) any agent who truly is qualified can be classified as positive by putting in effort. Thus, the ability for agents to improve has the potential to allow for a goal one could not hope to achieve in standard models, namely zero error.
  In this paper, we explore this phenomenon more broadly, giving general results and examining under what conditions the ability of agents to improve can allow for a reduction in the sample complexity of learning, or alternatively, can make learning harder. We also examine both theoretically and empirically what kinds of improvement-aware algorithms can take into account agents who have the ability to improve to a limited extent when it is in their interest to do so.

Abstract: We propose causal effect estimators based on empirical Fr\'{e}chet means and operator-valued kernels, tailored to functional data spaces. These methods address the challenges of high-dimensionality, sequential ordering, and model complexity while preserving robustness to treatment misspecification. Using structural assumptions, we obtain compact representations of potential outcomes, enabling scalable estimation of causal effects over time and across covariates. We provide both theoretical, regarding the consistency of functional causal effects, as well as empirical comparison of a range of proposed causal effect estimators.
  Applications to binary treatment settings with functional outcomes illustrate the framework's utility in biomedical monitoring, where outcomes exhibit complex temporal dynamics. Our estimators accommodate scenarios with registered covariates and outcomes, aligning them to the Fr\'{e}chet means, as well as cases requiring higher-order representations to capture intricate covariate-outcome interactions. These advancements extend causal inference to dynamic and non-linear domains, offering new tools for understanding complex treatment effects in functional data settings.

Abstract: Music source separation is the task of separating a mixture of instruments into constituent tracks. Music source separation models are typically trained using only audio data, although additional information can be used to improve the model's separation capability. In this paper, we propose two ways of using musical scores to aid music source separation: a score-informed model where the score is concatenated with the magnitude spectrogram of the audio mixture as the input of the model, and a model where we use only the score to calculate the separation mask. We train our models on synthetic data in the SynthSOD dataset and evaluate our methods on the URMP and Aalto anechoic orchestra datasets, comprised of real recordings. The score-informed model improves separation results compared to a baseline approach, but struggles to generalize from synthetic to real data, whereas the score-only model shows a clear improvement in synthetic-to-real generalization.

<title>Mitigating Visual Forgetting via Take-along Visual Conditioning for Multi-modal Long CoT Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities, evolving from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to advanced, product-oriented solutions like OpenAI o1. During our re-implementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from a gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only a ~2% accuracy drop on MathVista's test-hard subset, revealing the model's textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a strategy that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens via dynamic pruning. This methodology helps the model retain attention to the visual components throughout the reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+3.4 points vs previous sota), demonstrating the effectiveness of TVC in enhancing multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: The decentralized gradient descent (DGD) algorithm, and its sibling, diffusion, are workhorses in decentralized machine learning, distributed inference and estimation, and multi-agent coordination. We propose a novel, principled framework for the analysis of DGD and diffusion for strongly convex, smooth objectives, and arbitrary undirected topologies, using contraction mappings coupled with a result called the mean Hessian theorem (MHT). The use of these tools yields tight convergence bounds, both in the noise-free and noisy regimes. While these bounds are qualitatively similar to results found in the literature, our approach using contractions together with the MHT decouples the algorithm dynamics (how quickly the algorithm converges to its fixed point) from its asymptotic convergence properties (how far the fixed point is from the global optimum). This yields a simple, intuitive analysis that is accessible to a broader audience. Extensions are provided to multiple local gradient updates, time-varying step sizes, noisy gradients (stochastic DGD and diffusion), communication noise, and random topologies.

<title>Towards Automated Semantic Interpretability in Reinforcement Learning via Vision-Language Models</title>

arXiv:2503.16724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic interpretability in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables transparency and verifiability by making the agent's decisions understandable and verifiable. Achieving this, however, requires a feature space composed of human-understandable concepts, which traditionally rely on human specification and may fail to generalize to unseen environments. We introduce interpretable Tree-based Reinforcement learning via Automated Concept Extraction (iTRACE), an automated framework that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) for semantic feature extraction and interpretable tree-based models for policy optimization. iTRACE first extracts semantically meaningful features, then maps them to policies via interpretable trees. To address the impracticality of running VLMs in RL loops, we distill their outputs into a lightweight model. By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate tree-based reinforcement learning, iTRACE eliminates the need for human annotation traditionally required by interpretable models, while also addressing the limitations of VLMs alone, such as their lack of grounding in action spaces and inability to directly optimize policies. iTRACE outperforms MLP baselines that use the same interpretable features and matches the performance of CNN-based policies, producing verifiable, semantically interpretable, and human-aligned behaviors without requiring human annotation.

Abstract: Data annotation is an essential component of the machine learning pipeline; it is also a costly and time-consuming process. With the introduction of transformer-based models, annotation at the document level is increasingly popular; however, there is no standard framework for structuring such tasks. The EffiARA annotation framework is, to our knowledge, the first project to support the whole annotation pipeline, from understanding the resources required for an annotation task to compiling the annotated dataset and gaining insights into the reliability of individual annotators as well as the dataset as a whole. The framework's efficacy is supported by two previous studies: one improving classification performance through annotator-reliability-based soft-label aggregation and sample weighting, and the other increasing the overall agreement among annotators through removing identifying and replacing an unreliable annotator. This work introduces the EffiARA Python package and its accompanying webtool, which provides an accessible graphical user interface for the system. We open-source the EffiARA Python package at https://github.com/MiniEggz/EffiARA and the webtool is publicly accessible at https://effiara.gate.ac.uk.

arXiv:2504.08335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using entropic inequalities from information theory, we provide new bounds on the total variation and 2-Wasserstein distances between a conditionally Gaussian law and a Gaussian law with invertible covariance matrix. We apply our results to quantify the speed of convergence to Gaussian of a randomly initialized fully connected neural network and its derivatives - evaluated in a finite number of inputs - when the initialization is Gaussian and the sizes of the inner layers diverge to infinity. Our results require mild assumptions on the activation function, and allow one to recover optimal rates of convergence in a variety of distances, thus improving and extending the findings of Basteri and Trevisan (2023), Favaro et al. (2023), Trevisan (2024) and Apollonio et al. (2024). One of our main tools are the quantitative cumulant estimates established in Hanin (2024). As an illustration, we apply our results to bound the total variation distance between the Bayesian posterior law of the neural network and its derivatives, and the posterior law of the corresponding Gaussian limit: this yields quantitative versions of a posterior CLT by Hron et al. (2022), and extends several estimates by Trevisan (2024) to the total variation metric.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities that benefits from online reinforcement learning (RL). These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO, the first integration of policy gradient methods to masked dLLMs. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and planning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM. Our code is released at https://dllm-reasoning.github.io/.

Abstract: Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the software industry by enabling FMware, systems that integrate these FMs as core components. In this KDD 2025 tutorial, we present a comprehensive exploration of FMware that combines a curated catalogue of challenges with real-world production concerns. We first discuss the state of research and practice in building FMware. We further examine the difficulties in selecting suitable models, aligning high-quality domain-specific data, engineering robust prompts, and orchestrating autonomous agents. We then address the complex journey from impressive demos to production-ready systems by outlining issues in system testing, optimization, deployment, and integration with legacy software. Drawing on our industrial experience and recent research in the area, we provide actionable insights and a technology roadmap for overcoming these challenges. Attendees will gain practical strategies to enable the creation of trustworthy FMware in the evolving technology landscape.

arXiv:2505.13508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but lack robust temporal intelligence, struggling to integrate reasoning about the past with predictions and plausible generations of the future. Meanwhile, existing methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization, particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce \textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter) LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL) curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system. This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1, on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered, progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly time-aware AI. To foster further research, we also release \textit{Time-Bench}, a large-scale multi-task temporal reasoning dataset derived from 10 years of news data, and our series of \textit{Time-R1} checkpoints.

<title>Learning Collision Risk from Naturalistic Driving with Generalised Surrogate Safety Measures</title>

arXiv:2505.13556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and timely alerts for drivers or automated systems to unfolding collisions remains a challenge in road safety, particularly in highly interactive urban traffic. Existing approaches require labour-intensive annotation of sparse risk, struggle to consider varying contextual factors, or are useful only in the scenarios they are designed for. To address these limits, this study introduces the generalised surrogate safety measure (GSSM), a new approach that learns exclusively from naturalistic driving without crash or risk labels. GSSM captures the patterns of normal driving and estimates the extent to which a traffic interaction deviates from the norm towards unsafe extreme. Utilising neural networks, normal interactions are characterised by context-conditioned distributions of multi-directional spacing between road users. In the same interaction context, a spacing closer than normal entails higher risk of potential collision. Then a context-adaptive risk score and its associated probability can be calculated based on the theory of extreme values. Any measurable factors, such as motion kinematics, weather, lighting, can serve as part of the context, allowing for diverse coverage of safety-critical interactions. Multiple public driving datasets are used to train GSSMs, which are tested with 2,591 real-world crashes and near-crashes reconstructed from the SHRP2 NDS. A vanilla GSSM using only instantaneous states achieves AUPRC of 0.9 and secures a median time advance of 2.6 seconds to prevent potential collisions. Additional data and contextual factors provide further performance gains. Across various interaction types such as rear-end, merging, and crossing, the accuracy and timeliness of GSSM consistently outperforms existing baselines. GSSM therefore establishes a scalable, context-aware, and generalisable foundation to proactively quantify collision risk in traffic interactions.

arXiv:2505.14806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hippocampus enables spatial navigation through place cell populations forming cognitive maps. We propose proximity-preserving neural embeddings to encode multi-scale random walk transitions, where the inner product $\langle h(x, t), h(y, t) \rangle = q(y|x, t)$ represents normalized transition probabilities, with $h(x, t)$ as the embedding at location $x$ and $q(y|x, t)$ as the transition probability at scale $\sqrt{t}$. This scale hierarchy mirrors hippocampal dorsoventral organization. The embeddings $h(x, t)$ reduce pairwise spatial proximity into an environmental map, with Euclidean distances preserving proximity information. We use gradient ascent on $q(y|x, t)$ for straight-forward path planning, employing adaptive scale selection for trap-free, smooth trajectories, equivalent to minimizing embedding space distances. Matrix squaring ($P_{2t} = P_t^2$) efficiently builds global transitions from local ones ($P_1$), enabling preplay-like shortcut prediction. Experiments demonstrate localized place fields, multi-scale tuning, adaptability, and remapping, achieving robust navigation in complex environments. Our biologically plausible framework, extensible to theta-phase precession, unifies spatial and temporal coding for scalable navigation.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient quantification of cardiac function is essential for the estimation of prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating cardiac pumping performance is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF can be affected by factors such as inter-observer variability and varying pre-load and after-load conditions, which can reduce its reproducibility. Additionally, cardiac dysfunction may not always manifest as alterations in LVEF, such as in heart failure and cardiotoxicity diseases. An alternative measure that can provide a relatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility is myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with myocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac function. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from cine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain calculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential frames, which can be accomplished using registration models. These tasks are often performed separately, potentially limiting the assessment of cardiac function. To address this issue, in this study we propose an end-to-end deep learning (DL) model that jointly estimates groupwise (GW) registration and segmentation for cardiac cine-MRI images. The proposed anatomically-guided Deep GW network was trained and validated on a large dataset of 4-chamber view cine-MRI image series of 374 subjects. A quantitative comparison with conventional GW registration using elastix and two DL-based methods showed that the proposed model improved performance and substantially reduced computation time.

Abstract: This study analyzes tract-level real estate ownership patterns in New York State (NYS) and New York City (NYC) to uncover racial disparities. We use an advanced race/ethnicity imputation model (LSTM+Geo with XGBoost filtering, validated at 89.2% accuracy) to compare the predicted racial composition of property owners to the resident population from census data. We examine both a Full Model (statewide) and a Name-Only LSTM Model (NYC) to assess how incorporating geospatial context affects our predictions and disparity estimates. The results reveal significant inequities: White individuals hold a disproportionate share of properties and property value relative to their population, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities are underrepresented as property owners. These disparities are most pronounced in minority-majority neighborhoods, where ownership is predominantly White despite a predominantly non-White population. Corporate ownership (LLCs, trusts, etc.) exacerbates these gaps by reducing owner-occupied opportunities in urban minority communities. We provide a breakdown of ownership vs. population by race for majority-White, -Black, -Hispanic, and -Asian tracts, identify those with extreme ownership disparities, and compare patterns in urban, suburban, and rural contexts. The findings underscore persistent racial inequity in property ownership, reflecting broader historical and socio-economic forces, and highlight the importance of data-driven approaches to address these issues.

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion faces a critical scalability challenge: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods require task-specific rewards and struggle to leverage growing datasets, even as more training terrains are introduced. We propose DreamPolicy, a unified framework that enables a single policy to master diverse terrains and generalize zero-shot to unseen scenarios by systematically integrating offline data and diffusion-driven motion synthesis. At its core, DreamPolicy introduces Humanoid Motion Imagery (HMI) - future state predictions synthesized through an autoregressive terrain-aware diffusion planner curated by aggregating rollouts from specialized policies across various distinct terrains. Unlike human motion datasets requiring laborious retargeting, our data directly captures humanoid kinematics, enabling the diffusion planner to synthesize "dreamed" trajectories that encode terrain-specific physical constraints. These trajectories act as dynamic objectives for our HMI-conditioned policy, bypassing manual reward engineering and enabling cross-terrain generalization. DreamPolicy addresses the scalability limitations of prior methods: while traditional RL fails to exploit growing datasets, our framework scales seamlessly with more offline data. As the dataset expands, the diffusion prior learns richer locomotion skills, which the policy leverages to master new terrains without retraining. Experiments demonstrate that DreamPolicy achieves average 90% success rates in training environments and an average of 20% higher success on unseen terrains than the prevalent method. It also generalizes to perturbed and composite scenarios where prior approaches collapse. By unifying offline data, diffusion-based trajectory synthesis, and policy optimization, DreamPolicy overcomes the "one task, one policy" bottleneck, establishing a paradigm for scalable, data-driven humanoid control.

<title>Do Large Language Models (Really) Need Statistical Foundations?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a new paradigm for processing unstructured data, with applications across an unprecedented range of domains. In this paper, we address, through two arguments, whether the development and application of LLMs would genuinely benefit from foundational contributions from the statistics discipline. First, we argue affirmatively, beginning with the observation that LLMs are inherently statistical models due to their profound data dependency and stochastic generation processes, where statistical insights are naturally essential for handling variability and uncertainty. Second, we argue that the persistent black-box nature of LLMs -- stemming from their immense scale, architectural complexity, and development practices often prioritizing empirical performance over theoretical interpretability -- renders closed-form or purely mechanistic analyses generally intractable, thereby necessitating statistical approaches due to their flexibility and often demonstrated effectiveness. To substantiate these arguments, the paper outlines several research areas -- including alignment, watermarking, uncertainty quantification, evaluation, and data mixture optimization -- where statistical methodologies are critically needed and are already beginning to make valuable contributions. We conclude with a discussion suggesting that statistical research concerning LLMs will likely form a diverse ``mosaic'' of specialized topics rather than deriving from a single unifying theory, and highlighting the importance of timely engagement by our statistics community in LLM research.

<title>Beyond Prompt Engineering: Robust Behavior Control in LLMs via Steering Target Atoms</title>

Abstract: Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE) to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However, these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model, confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.

<title>Joint estimation of smooth graph signals from partial linear measurements</title>

arXiv:2505.23240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an undirected and connected graph $G$ on $T$ vertices, suppose each vertex $t$ has a latent signal $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ associated to it. Given partial linear measurements of the signals, for a potentially small subset of the vertices, our goal is to estimate $x_t$'s. Assuming that the signals are smooth w.r.t $G$, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the signals over the graph is small, we obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error for jointly recovering $x_t$'s, for the smoothness penalized least squares estimator. In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this estimator is weakly consistent (as $T \rightarrow \infty$) under potentially very stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a vanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a ``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths of a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are obtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency is established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are very sparse and disconnected.

Abstract: The proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse downstream tasks necessitates efficient model selection, given the impracticality of fine-tuning all candidates due to computational constraints. Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods. We open-source our proposed LENSLLM model and corresponding results at LensLLM.io.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new practical threat model called Fake Data Injection for adversarial attacks on stochastic bandits. This model allows attackers to inject a limited number of bounded fake feedback samples into the learner's history, simulating legitimate interactions. The proposed attack strategies efficiently mislead Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms by addressing both magnitude and temporal constraints. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that these attacks can manipulate the algorithms into selecting a target arm in nearly all rounds with minimal attack cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of the strategies and highlight vulnerabilities in widely used stochastic bandit algorithms under practical adversarial scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on stochastic bandits have traditionally relied on some unrealistic assumptions, such as per-round reward manipulation and unbounded perturbations, limiting their relevance to real-world systems. We propose a more practical threat model, Fake Data Injection, which reflects realistic adversarial constraints: the attacker can inject only a limited number of bounded fake feedback samples into the learner's history, simulating legitimate interactions. We design efficient attack strategies under this model, explicitly addressing both magnitude constraints (on reward values) and temporal constraints (on when and how often data can be injected). Our theoretical analysis shows that these attacks can mislead both Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms into selecting a target arm in nearly all rounds while incurring only sublinear attack cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our strategies, revealing significant vulnerabilities in widely used stochastic bandit algorithms under practical adversarial scenarios.

Summary:
This study addresses the fairness issue in K-means clustering algorithms, where clusters may exhibit bias based on sensitive variables such as gender or race. The proposed approach involves a two-stage optimization process that first performs clustering and then adjusts the cluster membership of selected data points to improve fairness. Two efficient algorithms are introduced to identify problematic data points that may impact fairness. One algorithm focuses on nearest data points outside of a cluster, while the other targets highly 'mixed' data points. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in fairness while maintaining clustering quality. The proposed algorithms can be easily adapted to various clustering methods and fairness metrics, offering a practical solution to address biases in clustering outcomes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The popular K-means clustering algorithm potentially suffers from a major weakness for further analysis or interpretation. Some cluster may have disproportionately more (or fewer) points from one of the subpopulations in terms of some sensitive variable, e.g., gender or race. Such a fairness issue may cause bias and unexpected social consequences. This work attempts to improve the fairness of K-means clustering with a two-stage optimization formulation--clustering first and then adjust cluster membership of a small subset of selected data points. Two computationally efficient algorithms are proposed in identifying those data points that are expensive for fairness, with one focusing on nearest data points outside of a cluster and the other on highly 'mixed' data points. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial improvement on fairness with a minimal impact to clustering quality. The proposed algorithms can be easily extended to a broad class of clustering algorithms or fairness metrics.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the MatTA framework, which is designed to efficiently train multiple accurate student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. By leveraging TA models, which are larger versions of student models, MatTA enables student models to better relate to the teacher model and incorporate domain-specific expertise. This approach allows for multiple servable options with varying levels of accuracy without the need for additional training runs, thereby providing a cost-effective solution. The practical efficacy of MatTA is demonstrated through live A/B tests within a production ML system, showcasing a 20% improvement on a key metric. Additionally, the method is applied to the GPT-2 Medium model, achieving significant relative improvements on both the SAT Math and LAMBADA benchmark tasks. Overall, the MatTA framework offers a versatile and efficient approach to model training that can enhance performance and reduce serving costs.

Abstract: Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving serving constraints, which requires significant resources for model development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary datasets and models. Its practical efficacy is underscored by live A/B tests within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric. We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve relative improvements of over 24% on SAT Math and over 10% on the LAMBADA benchmark.

Abstract: Speaker-dependent modelling can substantially improve performance in speech-based health monitoring applications. While mixed-effect models are commonly used for such speaker adaptation, they require computationally expensive retraining for each new observation, making them impractical in a production environment. We reformulate this task as a meta-learning problem and explore three approaches of increasing complexity: ensemble-based distance models, prototypical networks, and transformer-based sequence models. Using pre-trained speech embeddings, we evaluate these methods on a large longitudinal dataset of shift workers (N=1,185, 10,286 recordings), predicting time since sleep from speech as a function of fatigue, a symptom commonly associated with ill-health. Our results demonstrate that all meta-learning approaches tested outperformed both cross-sectional and conventional mixed-effects models, with a transformer-based method achieving the strongest performance.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have found success by using powerful probabilistic models, such as transformers, energy-based models, and diffusion/flow-based models. To this end, RL researchers often choose to pay the price of accommodating these models into their algorithms -- diffusion models are expressive, but are computationally intensive due to their reliance on solving differential equations, while autoregressive transformer models are scalable but typically require learning discrete representations. Normalizing flows (NFs), by contrast, seem to provide an appealing alternative, as they enable likelihoods and sampling without solving differential equations or autoregressive architectures. However, their potential in RL has received limited attention, partly due to the prevailing belief that normalizing flows lack sufficient expressivity. We show that this is not the case. Building on recent work in NFs, we propose a single NF architecture which integrates seamlessly into RL algorithms, serving as a policy, Q-function, and occupancy measure. Our approach leads to much simpler algorithms, and achieves higher performance in imitation learning, offline, goal conditioned RL and unsupervised RL.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the impact of resource constraints on AI agents with agentic capabilities, highlighting how such constraints can lead to shifts in their rational behavior. It focuses on a survival bandit framework to formalize the setting where agents face trade-offs due to limited resources. The study explores the emergence of misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives in such scenarios, offering theoretical and empirical results to quantify the effects. The research identifies conditions under which misalignment occurs and proposes strategies to mitigate risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviors in AI agents. By enhancing understanding of how agents operate under survival pressure, the work aims to provide guidelines for safely deploying AI systems in critical resource-limited environments. <div>
arXiv:2505.23436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under (approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is susceptible to modality imbalance, where dominant modalities overshadow weak ones, easily leading to biased learning and suboptimal fusion, especially for incomplete modality conditions. To address this problem, we propose a Shapley-guided alternating training framework that adaptively prioritizes minor modalities to balance and thus enhance the fusion. Our method leverages Shapley Value-based scheduling to improve the training sequence adaptively, ensuring that under-optimized modalities receive sufficient learning. Additionally, we introduce the memory module to refine and inherit modality-specific representations with a cross-modal mapping mechanism to align features at both the feature and sample levels. To further validate the adaptability of the proposed approach, the encoder module empirically adopts both conventional and LLM-based backbones. With building up a novel multimodal equilibrium metric, namely, equilibrium deviation metric (EDM), we evaluate the performance in both balance and accuracy across four multimodal benchmark datasets, where our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Meanwhile, robustness analysis under missing modalities highlights its strong generalization capabilities. Accordingly, our findings reveal the untapped potential of alternating training, demonstrating that strategic modality prioritization fundamentally balances and promotes multimodal learning, offering a new paradigm for optimizing multimodal training dynamics.

Our model was compared against several models, namely fNIRSNET, MDNN, DeepConvNet, and ShallowConvNet. The results showed that AbsoluteNet outperforms existing models, reaching 87.0% accuracy, 84.8% sensitivity, and 89.2% specificity in binary classification, surpassing fNIRSNET, the second-best model, by 3.8% in accuracy. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our proposed deep learning model in decoding hemodynamic responses related to auditory processing and highlight the importance of spatio-temporal feature aggregation and customized activation functions to better fit fNIRS dynamics.

<br />
Summary:
Offline-to-online deployment of RL agents faces challenges in bridging the sim-to-real and interaction gaps. DT-CORL, a framework introduced in this study, addresses these challenges by producing delay-robust actions using a transformer-based belief predictor and improving sample efficiency compared to history-augmentation baselines. The framework demonstrates superior performance on D4RL benchmarks with varying delay settings, outperforming both history-augmentation and vanilla belief-based methods. By narrowing the sim-to-real latency gap and maintaining data efficiency, DT-CORL shows promise in addressing the challenges associated with deploying RL agents in real-world environments with delayed dynamics. <div>

Abstract: Offline-to-online deployment of reinforcement-learning (RL) agents must bridge two gaps: (1) the sim-to-real gap, where real systems add latency and other imperfections not present in simulation, and (2) the interaction gap, where policies trained purely offline face out-of-distribution states during online execution because gathering new interaction data is costly or risky. Agents therefore have to generalize from static, delay-free datasets to dynamic, delay-prone environments. Standard offline RL learns from delay-free logs yet must act under delays that break the Markov assumption and hurt performance. We introduce DT-CORL (Delay-Transformer belief policy Constrained Offline RL), an offline-RL framework built to cope with delayed dynamics at deployment. DT-CORL (i) produces delay-robust actions with a transformer-based belief predictor even though it never sees delayed observations during training, and (ii) is markedly more sample-efficient than na\"ive history-augmentation baselines. Experiments on D4RL benchmarks with several delay settings show that DT-CORL consistently outperforms both history-augmentation and vanilla belief-based methods, narrowing the sim-to-real latency gap while preserving data efficiency.

<title>Tradeoffs between Mistakes and ERM Oracle Calls in Online and Transductive Online Learning</title>

<div> Online learning, transductive learning, Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), weak consistency oracles, concept class<br />
<br />Summary: <br />This study examines online and transductive online learning with interaction through ERM or weak consistency oracles on subsets of a concept class. Tight lower bounds are proven in standard online settings with ERM access. Existing online learning results with ERM access are shown to carry over to the weak consistency setting with an additional cost in oracle calls. For the transductive online model, optimal mistake bounds can be achieved using weak consistency oracle calls for general Littlestone classes. Limiting the learner to a certain number of queries is necessary for efficient transductive online learning. Randomized algorithms are employed to reduce oracle calls while maintaining mistake bounds for specific concept classes such as Thresholds and $k$-Intervals. In particular, a logarithmic number of ERM queries are sufficient for Thresholds, while a polynomial number of weak consistency queries are required for $k$-Intervals. <div>
arXiv:2506.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online and transductive online learning when the learner interacts with the concept class only via Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) or weak consistency oracles on arbitrary instance subsets. This contrasts with standard online models, where the learner knows the entire class. The ERM oracle returns a hypothesis minimizing loss on a given subset, while the weak consistency oracle returns a binary signal indicating whether the subset is realizable by some concept. The learner is evaluated by the number of mistakes and oracle calls. In the standard online setting with ERM access, we prove tight lower bounds in both realizable and agnostic cases: $\Omega(2^{d_{VC}})$ mistakes and $\Omega(\sqrt{T 2^{d_{LD}}})$ regret, where $T$ is the number of timesteps and $d_{LD}$ is the Littlestone dimension. We further show that existing online learning results with ERM access carry over to the weak consistency setting, incurring an additional $O(T)$ in oracle calls. We then consider the transductive online model, where the instance sequence is known but labels are revealed sequentially. For general Littlestone classes, we show that optimal realizable and agnostic mistake bounds can be achieved using $O(T^{d_{VC}+1})$ weak consistency oracle calls. On the negative side, we show that limiting the learner to $\Omega(T)$ weak consistency queries is necessary for transductive online learnability, and that restricting the learner to $\Omega(T)$ ERM queries is necessary to avoid exponential dependence on the Littlestone dimension. Finally, for certain concept classes, we reduce oracle calls via randomized algorithms while maintaining similar mistake bounds. In particular, for Thresholds on an unknown ordering, $O(\log T)$ ERM queries suffice; for $k$-Intervals, $O(T^3 2^{2k})$ weak consistency queries suffice.

<div> Diffusion autoencoders, latent variable, generative models, downstream tasks, domain transfer
<br />
Diffusion autoencoders (DAs) are models that use an input-dependent latent variable to capture representations in addition to the diffusion process. Another class of diffusion models focuses on learning the forward process. By combining design decisions from both classes, a new model termed DMZ is proposed. The DMZ model achieves effective representations for downstream tasks and domain transfer while also improving generative performance by reducing denoising steps compared to standard models. This innovative approach enhances the efficiency of generative modelling while maintaining the quality of learned representations.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion autoencoders (DAs) are variants of diffusion generative models that use an input-dependent latent variable to capture representations alongside the diffusion process. These representations, to varying extents, can be used for tasks such as downstream classification, controllable generation, and interpolation. However, the generative performance of DAs relies heavily on how well the latent variables can be modelled and subsequently sampled from. Better generative modelling is also the primary goal of another class of diffusion models -- those that learn their forward (noising) process. While effective at adjusting the noise process in an input-dependent manner, they must satisfy additional constraints derived from the terminal conditions of the diffusion process. Here, we draw a connection between these two classes of models and show that certain design decisions (latent variable choice, conditioning method, etc.) in the DA framework -- leading to a model we term DMZ -- allow us to obtain the best of both worlds: effective representations as evaluated on downstream tasks, including domain transfer, as well as more efficient modelling and generation with fewer denoising steps compared to standard DMs.

<div> Keywords: large language models, fine-tuning, observational data, confounders, DeconfoundLM

Summary: 

Large language models (LLMs) are commonly used in various industries for content generation to improve key performance metrics. Fine-tuning these models with good-quality labeled data is crucial for aligning with human preferences and business objectives. However, conducting controlled experiments like A/B tests for gathering such data can be expensive and challenging. This study explores the potential of using observational data, which is often underutilized, for fine-tuning LLMs. While observational outcomes can serve as useful guidance, directly fine-tuning models on such data may lead to learning spurious correlations. The DeconfoundLM method proposed in this work aims to address this issue by removing the impact of known confounding variables from reward signals. Empirical evidence from real-world datasets showcases the importance of causal corrections in utilizing observational data effectively for LLM alignment. By mitigating the risks associated with confounding variables, DeconfoundLM enhances the recovery of causal relationships and improves the performance of fine-tuned models. <div>

Abstract: Large language models are being widely used across industries to generate content that contributes directly to key performance metrics, such as conversion rates. Pretrained models, however, often fall short when it comes to aligning with human preferences or optimizing for business objectives. As a result, fine-tuning with good-quality labeled data is essential to guide models to generate content that achieves better results. Controlled experiments, like A/B tests, can provide such data, but they are often expensive and come with significant engineering and logistical challenges. Meanwhile, companies have access to a vast amount of historical (observational) data that remains underutilized. In this work, we study the challenges and opportunities of fine-tuning LLMs using observational data. We show that while observational outcomes can provide valuable supervision, directly fine-tuning models on such data can lead them to learn spurious correlations. We present empirical evidence of this issue using various real-world datasets and propose DeconfoundLM, a method that explicitly removes the effect of known confounders from reward signals. Using simulation experiments, we demonstrate that DeconfoundLM improves the recovery of causal relationships and mitigates failure modes found in fine-tuning methods that ignore or naively incorporate confounding variables. Our findings highlight that while observational data presents risks, with the right causal corrections, it can be a powerful source of signal for LLM alignment.

<div> emerging, zeroth-order optimization, differential privacy, memory constraints, smooth loss functions
<br />
Zeroth-order optimization has become a popular method for fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific data while ensuring differential privacy and working within memory constraints. This approach is promising but lacks comprehensive analysis and design for privacy protection. The question of hidden-state differential privacy analysis in zeroth-order optimization has been unanswered, hindering further development in this area. This work addresses this gap by proving a convergent differential privacy bound for zeroth-order optimization, adapting the privacy amplification-by-iteration framework to smooth loss functions. This novel analysis leads to improved algorithmic designs for zeroth-order optimization that were previously unknown in the literature.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization has emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning large language models on domain-specific data, particularly under differential privacy (DP) and memory constraints. While first-order methods have been extensively studied from a privacy perspective, the privacy analysis and algorithmic design for zeroth-order methods remain significantly underexplored. A critical open question concerns hidden-state DP analysis: although convergent privacy bounds are known for first-order methods, it has remained unclear whether similar guarantees can be established for zeroth-order methods. In this work, we provide an affirmative answer by proving a convergent DP bound for zeroth-order optimization. Our analysis generalizes the celebrated privacy amplification-by-iteration framework to the setting of smooth loss functions in zeroth-order optimization. Furthermore, it induces better DP zeroth-order algorithmic designs that are previously unknown to the literature.

Abstract: Existing paradigms for ensuring AI safety, such as guardrail models and alignment training, often compromise either inference efficiency or development flexibility. We introduce Disentangled Safety Adapters (DSA), a novel framework addressing these challenges by decoupling safety-specific computations from a task-optimized base model. DSA utilizes lightweight adapters that leverage the base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models, notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails). Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining 98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8 percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning. Overall, DSA presents a promising path towards more modular, efficient, and adaptable AI safety and alignment.

<div> Keywords: large language models, benchmarking methodology, code-repair tasks, task difficulty, automatic generation

Summary:
The article introduces Breakpoint, a benchmarking methodology designed to assess the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in solving complex code-repair tasks in real-world software repositories. Breakpoint automatically generates tasks by corrupting functions in these repositories, controlling task difficulty based on local and system-level reasoning dimensions. Through more than 900 generated tasks, Breakpoint demonstrates scalable difficulty levels, with success rates of state-of-the-art models ranging from 55% on easier tasks to 0% on the most challenging ones. This novel approach allows for the evaluation of LLMs in tasks that require swift comprehension and manipulation of intricate structures, crucial for fields like software engineering and scientific research. <div>
arXiv:2506.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) have predominantly assessed short-horizon, localized reasoning. Existing long-horizon suites (e.g. SWE-bench) rely on manually curated issues, so expanding or tuning difficulty demands expensive human effort and evaluations quickly saturate. However, many real-world tasks, such as software engineering or scientific research, require agents to rapidly comprehend and manipulate novel, complex structures dynamically; evaluating these capabilities requires the ability to construct large and varied sets of problems for agents to solve. We introduce Breakpoint, a benchmarking methodology that automatically generates code-repair tasks by adversarially corrupting functions within real-world software repositories. Breakpoint systematically controls task difficulty along two clear dimensions: local reasoning (characterized by code complexity metrics such as cyclomatic complexity) and system-level reasoning (characterized by call-graph centrality and the number of simultaneously corrupted interdependent functions). In experiments across more than 900 generated tasks we demonstrate that our methodology can scale to arbitrary difficulty, with state-of-the-art models' success rates ranging from 55% on the easiest tasks down to 0% on the hardest.

Summary: 
The article addresses the issue of accountability attribution in modern AI development pipelines, where multiple stages such as pretraining and fine-tuning rounds play a role in the model's success or failure. The proposed framework aims to trace model behavior back to specific training stages by answering counterfactual questions about the effects of each stage. Estimators based on first-order approximations are introduced to efficiently quantify the effects of training stages without the need for retraining. These estimators consider elements such as learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay in optimization dynamics. Empirical demonstrations show that the approach can identify the training stages responsible for specific model behaviors, providing a practical tool for model analysis and promoting more accountable AI development.

arXiv:2506.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI development pipelines often involve multiple stages-pretraining, fine-tuning rounds, and subsequent adaptation or alignment-with numerous model update steps within each stage. This raises a critical question of accountability: when a deployed model succeeds or fails, which stage is responsible, and to what extent? We pose the problem of accountability attribution, which aims to trace model behavior back to specific stages of the training process. To address this, we propose a general framework that answers counterfactual questions about stage effects: how would the model behavior have changed if the updates from a training stage had not been executed?. Within this framework, we introduce estimators based on first-order approximations that efficiently quantify the stage effects without retraining. Our estimators account for both the training data and key aspects of optimization dynamics, including learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach identifies training stages accountable for specific behaviors, offering a practical tool for model analysis and a step toward more accountable AI development.

This article investigates the dynamics of Distributed SGD, Distributed Compressed SGD, and Distributed SignSGD using stochastic differential equation approximations. The study considers smoothness and noise assumptions and explores the interactions between batch noise, stochastic gradient compression, and adaptivity. The analysis reveals that adaptive methods like Distributed SignSGD can converge successfully with standard learning rate scheduler assumptions, even with heavy-tailed noise. Conversely, Distributed (Compressed) SGD with pre-scheduled decaying learning rate struggles to converge unless the schedule incorporates an inverse dependency on the gradient norm, essentially behaving like an adaptive method in practice. <div>

Abstract: Using stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximations, we study the dynamics of Distributed SGD, Distributed Compressed SGD, and Distributed SignSGD under $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness and flexible noise assumptions. Our analysis provides insights -- which we validate through simulation -- into the intricate interactions between batch noise, stochastic gradient compression, and adaptivity in this modern theoretical setup. For instance, we show that \textit{adaptive} methods such as Distributed SignSGD can successfully converge under standard assumptions on the learning rate scheduler, even under heavy-tailed noise. On the contrary, Distributed (Compressed) SGD with pre-scheduled decaying learning rate fails to achieve convergence, unless such a schedule also accounts for an inverse dependency on the gradient norm -- de facto falling back into an adaptive method.

Summary:<br />
Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial, and the lack of causality in MLP-based mixer models can hinder accurate detection. To address this, a novel cluster-aware causal mixer model is proposed, grouping channels into clusters based on correlations. Each cluster has a dedicated embedding layer, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex inter-channel relationships. The introduction of a causal mixer ensures that temporal dependencies are preserved while mixing information. Furthermore, an anomaly detection framework accumulates evidence over time to prevent false positives. The model operates online, making it suitable for real-time tasks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the model consistently achieves superior F1 scores, highlighting its effectiveness in multivariate time series anomaly detection tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of anomalies in time series data is critical, given the significant risks associated with false or missed detections. While MLP-based mixer models have shown promise in time series analysis, they lack a causality mechanism to preserve temporal dependencies inherent in the system. Moreover, real-world multivariate time series often contain numerous channels with diverse inter-channel correlations. A single embedding mechanism for all channels does not effectively capture these complex relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cluster-aware causal mixer to effectively detect anomalies in multivariate time series. Our model groups channels into clusters based on their correlations, with each cluster processed through a dedicated embedding layer. In addition, we introduce a causal mixer in our model, which mixes the information while maintaining causality. Furthermore, we present an anomaly detection framework that accumulates the anomaly evidence over time to prevent false positives due to nominal outliers. Our proposed model operates in an online fashion, making it suitable for real-time time-series anomaly detection tasks. Experimental evaluations across six public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves superior F1 scores.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach for the design of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) using a reinforcement learning-enhanced, transformer-based framework. The method involves a generative model trained on MOFid sequences, a transformer-based property predictor, and a reinforcement learning module to optimize MOF candidates based on desired properties. By integrating property feedback into the sequence generation process, the approach aims to accelerate the inverse design of MOFs with specific functional attributes. This innovative use of large language models coupled with reinforcement learning demonstrates the potential for advancing computational MOF discovery and expanding possibilities in materials chemistry. <div>
arXiv:2506.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with application-specific properties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry, owing to the immense size and complexity of their structural design space. Conventional computational screening techniques such as molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT), while accurate, are computationally prohibitive at scale. Machine learning offers an exciting alternative by leveraging data-driven approaches to accelerate materials discovery. The complexity of MOFs, with their extended periodic structures and diverse topologies, creates both opportunities and challenges for generative modeling approaches. To address these challenges, we present a reinforcement learning-enhanced, transformer-based framework for the de novo design of MOFs. Central to our approach is MOFid, a chemically-informed string representation encoding both connectivity and topology, enabling scalable generative modeling. Our pipeline comprises three components: (1) a generative GPT model trained on MOFid sequences, (2) MOFormer, a transformer-based property predictor, and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL) module that optimizes generated candidates via property-guided reward functions. By integrating property feedback into sequence generation, our method drives the model toward synthesizable, topologically valid MOFs with desired functional attributes. This work demonstrates the potential of large language models, when coupled with reinforcement learning, to accelerate inverse design in reticular chemistry and unlock new frontiers in computational MOF discovery.

<div> Keywords: rehearsal-based methods, continual learning, forgetting, generalization error, overparameterized linear models

Summary: 
Rehearsal-based methods have been effective in combating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. This study investigates if sequential rehearsal, like human learning processes, can offer advantages over standard concurrent rehearsal. By analyzing overparameterized linear models, the researchers compare the two strategies and find that sequential rehearsal performs better in scenarios where tasks are less similar. Motivated by these findings, a Hybrid Rehearsal method is proposed, combining concurrent training for similar tasks and sequential revisiting for dissimilar tasks. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the benefits of this approach in mitigating forgetting and improving generalization performance. Experimental results with deep neural networks further validate the superiority of the hybrid method over standard concurrent rehearsal. This study contributes a comprehensive theoretical analysis of rehearsal-based continual learning strategies. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rehearsal-based methods have shown superior performance in addressing catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) by storing and training on a subset of past data alongside new data in current task. While such a concurrent rehearsal strategy is widely used, it remains unclear if this approach is always optimal. Inspired by human learning, where sequentially revisiting tasks helps mitigate forgetting, we explore whether sequential rehearsal can offer greater benefits for CL compared to standard concurrent rehearsal. To address this question, we conduct a theoretical analysis of rehearsal-based CL in overparameterized linear models, comparing two strategies: 1) Concurrent Rehearsal, where past and new data are trained together, and 2) Sequential Rehearsal, where new data is trained first, followed by revisiting past data sequentially. By explicitly characterizing forgetting and generalization error, we show that sequential rehearsal performs better when tasks are less similar. These insights further motivate a novel Hybrid Rehearsal method, which trains similar tasks concurrently and revisits dissimilar tasks sequentially. We characterize its forgetting and generalization performance, and our experiments with deep neural networks further confirm that the hybrid approach outperforms standard concurrent rehearsal. This work provides the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of rehearsal-based CL.

Summary: 
The article introduces CATCH-FM, a cancer pre-screening methodology that uses historical medical records to identify high-risk patients for further screening. By pretraining and fine-tuning foundation models on electronic healthcare records, CATCH-FM achieves strong efficacy with low risk, outperforming other models in cancer risk prediction. The methodology demonstrates robustness across different patient distributions, excels in capturing non-trivial cancer risk factors, and achieves state-of-the-art results in pancreatic cancer risk prediction. By operating in the ICD code space, CATCH-FM proves its ability to leverage healthcare data efficiently. The open-sourcing of the code will further contribute to advancing cancer screening methods and potentially saving lives. <div>

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.

<br />Summary:
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA offer compact alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank updates to pretrained weights. Existing approaches often overlook spatial patterns by relying on global low-rank structures. This study introduces Localized LoRA, a framework modeling weight updates as low-rank matrices applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This enables dense, localized updates without increasing trainable parameters. Formal comparisons between global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations show that Localized LoRA consistently achieves lower approximation errors under matched parameter budgets. Experiments in synthetic and practical settings demonstrate that Localized LoRA provides a more expressive and adaptable alternative, facilitating efficient fine-tuning with improved performance. <div>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank updates to pretrained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global low-rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space-without increasing the total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved performance.

<div> Keywords: denoising, graph data, label noise, node-level prediction, influence function

Summary:
DeGLIF is a denoising technique that uses clean data and the leave-one-out influence function to improve node-level prediction on graph data. It approximates the change in model parameters when a training point is removed and extends this to estimate the change in validation loss for GNNs. DeGLIF does not require knowledge of the noise model or level in the dataset, and two variants are proposed to identify noisy nodes. Computational experiments demonstrate DeGLIF's effectiveness, outperforming baseline algorithms in accuracy. One variant is proven to detect noisy points that increase risk. Overall, DeGLIF offers a robust method for denoising graph data and improving prediction accuracy. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy labelled datasets are generally inexpensive compared to clean labelled datasets, and the same is true for graph data. In this paper, we propose a denoising technique DeGLIF: Denoising Graph Data using Leave-One-Out Influence Function. DeGLIF uses a small set of clean data and the leave-one- out influence function to make label noise robust node-level prediction on graph data. Leave-one-out influence function approximates the change in the model parameters if a training point is removed from the training dataset. Recent advances propose a way to calculate the leave-one-out influence function for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We extend that recent work to estimate the change in validation loss, if a training node is removed from the training dataset. We use this estimate and a new theoretically motivated relabelling function to denoise the training dataset. We propose two DeGLIF variants to identify noisy nodes. Both these variants do not require any information about the noise model or the noise level in the dataset; DeGLIF also does not estimate these quantities. For one of these variants, we prove that the noisy points detected can indeed increase risk. We carry out detailed computational experiments on different datasets to show the effectiveness of DeGLIF. It achieves better accuracy than other baseline algorithms

Summary:
Nearest neighbor-inspired black-box method is proposed for detecting hallucination in large language models by quantifying uncertainty effectively. Intra-cluster and inter-cluster similarities are taken into account, enhancing traditional entropy estimation. The method, extendable to white-box settings, outperforms semantic entropy in text generation tasks like question answering, text summarization, and machine translation across Phi3 and Llama3 models. Theoretical results support the method's generalization of semantic entropy. The code repository for this approach is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be detected by assessing the uncertainty of model outputs, typically measured using entropy. Semantic entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address these limitations, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities. Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text summarization, and machine translation. Our code is available at https://github.com/BigML-CS-UCLA/SNNE.

Summary: 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision and Big Data analytics but require significant computational resources for training. Traditional training methods using back-propagation may be sub-optimal and time-consuming. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to efficiently search complex optimization landscapes. This study proposes a hybrid optimization method combining Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming and Stochastic Gradient Descent to accelerate CNN training. Tested on the MNIST dataset, the approach achieves a 10-15% accuracy improvement over standard methods while maintaining similar execution times. These results demonstrate the potential of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in High-Performance Computing environments for Big Data and Deep Learning. However, successfully harnessing these benefits requires careful alignment of algorithmic structures with underlying quantum mechanisms.

arXiv:2506.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are pivotal in computer vision and Big Data analytics but demand significant computational resources when trained on large-scale datasets. Conventional training via back-propagation (BP) with losses like Mean Squared Error or Cross-Entropy often requires extensive iterations and may converge sub-optimally. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative by leveraging superposition, tunneling, and entanglement to search complex optimization landscapes more efficiently. In this work, we propose a hybrid optimization method that combines an Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) formulation with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to accelerate CNN training. Evaluated on the MNIST dataset, our approach achieves a 10--15\% accuracy improvement over a standard BP-CNN baseline while maintaining similar execution times. These results illustrate the potential of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments for Big Data and Deep Learning. Fully realizing these benefits, however, requires a careful alignment of algorithmic structures with underlying quantum mechanisms.

Summary:
The article introduces the PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to improve the accuracy of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for degradation systems. This approach addresses the challenge of applying Vision Transformer (ViT) to multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction by permuting time series data to mimic spatial characteristics of image data. A novel permutation loss function is utilized to guide the convergence of matrices towards a permutation matrix. Experimental results on NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the PerFormer in RUL prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods using CNNs, RNNs, and other Transformer models. The study highlights the effectiveness and potential of the PerFormer in Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) applications.

arXiv:2506.00259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for degradation systems is crucial in modern prognostic and health management (PHM). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.

Summary:<br />
The paper investigates the sample complexities of learning the optimal state-action value function and an optimal policy in a discounted Markov decision process with recursive entropic risk-preferences. The model-based risk-sensitive $Q$-value-iteration (MB-RS-QVI) approach is introduced to provide PAC-bounds on the difference between the estimated value functions and the optimal ones. The bounds exhibit exponential dependence on the effective horizon and the learner's risk-sensitivity. Lower bounds are derived to show the tightness of the PAC-bounds in both $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$, as well as in terms of the number of actions involved. The analysis highlights the complexity of learning in risk-sensitive settings and reveals the trade-offs between risk-preferences and the efficiency of learning optimal policies. <div>
arXiv:2506.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the sample complexities of learning the optimal state-action value function $Q^*$ and an optimal policy $\pi^*$ in a discounted Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent has recursive entropic risk-preferences with risk-parameter $\beta\neq 0$ and where a generative model of the MDP is available. We provide and analyze a simple model based approach which we call model-based risk-sensitive $Q$-value-iteration (MB-RS-QVI) which leads to $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC-bounds on $\|Q^*-Q^k\|$, and $\|V^*-V^{\pi_k}\|$ where $Q_k$ is the output of MB-RS-QVI after k iterations and $\pi_k$ is the greedy policy with respect to $Q_k$. Both PAC-bounds have exponential dependence on the effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ and the strength of this dependence grows with the learners risk-sensitivity $|\beta|$. We also provide two lower bounds which shows that exponential dependence on $|\beta|\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ is unavoidable in both cases. The lower bounds reveal that the PAC-bounds are both tight in $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and that the PAC-bound on $Q$-learning is tight in the number of actions $A$, and that the PAC-bound on policy-learning is nearly tight in $A$.

<div> Direct Preference Optimization, AlphaFold, Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization, LigandMPNN, EnhancedMPNN

Summary:
Direct Preference Optimization and Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization were used to improve protein sequence design methods. By integrating AlphaFold pLDDT scores and applying residue-level structural rewards, the training objective was redefined to increase designability. This approach significantly increased the success rate of in silico protein design, particularly in challenging enzyme design benchmarks. The fine-tuned LigandMPNN with ResiDPO, called EnhancedMPNN, demonstrated a nearly 3-fold improvement in design success rate, from 6.56% to 17.57%. This method focuses on generating sequences with high designability, ensuring that the designed sequences have a higher likelihood of folding into the desired structure. By optimizing at a residue-level granularity and decoupling optimization across residues, the ResiDPO technique allows for direct improvement in designability while preserving well-performing regions. Overall, this approach enhances the effectiveness and reliability of protein sequence design for de novo protein design projects. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein sequence design methods have demonstrated strong performance in sequence generation for de novo protein design. However, as the training objective was sequence recovery, it does not guarantee designability--the likelihood that a designed sequence folds into the desired structure. To bridge this gap, we redefine the training objective by steering sequence generation toward high designability. To do this, we integrate Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), using AlphaFold pLDDT scores as the preference signal, which significantly improves the in silico design success rate. To further refine sequence generation at a finer, residue-level granularity, we introduce Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization (ResiDPO), which applies residue-level structural rewards and decouples optimization across residues. This enables direct improvement in designability while preserving regions that already perform well. Using a curated dataset with residue-level annotations, we fine-tune LigandMPNN with ResiDPO to obtain EnhancedMPNN, which achieves a nearly 3-fold increase in in silico design success rate (from 6.56% to 17.57%) on a challenging enzyme design benchmark.

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art generative models in various domains, yet their samples often fail to satisfy downstream objectives such as safety constraints or domain-specific validity. Existing techniques for alignment require gradients, internal model access, or large computational budgets. We introduce an inference-time alignment framework based on evolutionary algorithms. We treat diffusion models as black-boxes and search their latent space to maximize alignment objectives. Our method enables efficient inference-time alignment for both differentiable and non-differentiable alignment objectives across a range of diffusion models. On the DrawBench and Open Image Preferences benchmark, our EA methods outperform state-of-the-art gradient-based and gradient-free inference-time methods. In terms of memory consumption, we require 55% to 76% lower GPU memory than gradient-based methods. In terms of running-time, we are 72% to 80% faster than gradient-based methods. We achieve higher alignment scores over 50 optimization steps on Open Image Preferences than gradient-based and gradient-free methods.

Abstract: Most materials science datasets are limited to atomic geometries (e.g., XYZ files), restricting their utility for multimodal learning and comprehensive data-centric analysis. These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets.

<div> active learning, multiclass classification, surrogate risk minimization, realizability assumption, convex models

Summary:
In the context of active learning for multiclass classification, a new framework based on surrogate risk minimization is introduced. Unlike existing methods that rely on the realizability assumption, this framework operates beyond this constraint, allowing for applicability in practical, misspecified settings. The algorithm proposed in this work demonstrates that label and sample complexity can be achieved with weaker assumptions than realizability, as long as the model class is convex. The novel epoch-based approach involves fitting a model from the entire class to the queried data in each epoch and producing an improper classifier by aggregating these models. This departure from previous methods ensures comparable rates of performance, even in non-realizable settings where conventional approaches may fail to yield accurate results. <div>
arXiv:2506.00316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new active learning framework for multiclass classification based on surrogate risk minimization that operates beyond the standard realizability assumption. Existing surrogate-based active learning algorithms crucially rely on realizability$\unicode{x2014}$the assumption that the optimal surrogate predictor lies within the model class$\unicode{x2014}$limiting their applicability in practical, misspecified settings. In this work we show that under conditions significantly weaker than realizability, as long as the class of models considered is convex, one can still obtain a label and sample complexity comparable to prior work. Despite achieving similar rates, the algorithmic approaches from prior works can be shown to fail in non-realizable settings where our assumption is satisfied. Our epoch-based active learning algorithm departs from prior methods by fitting a model from the full class to the queried data in each epoch and returning an improper classifier obtained by aggregating these models.

Summary:
Foresight introduces an adaptive layer-reuse technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in video generation tasks. The proposed method dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs across denoising steps, optimizing efficiency based on generation parameters like resolution and denoising schedules. By applying Foresight to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX models, up to a 1.63x speedup in end-to-end processing is achieved while maintaining video quality. This approach addresses the computational cost challenges of spatial-temporal attention in DiTs by reducing redundancy without compromising performance. Foresight's source code is publicly available for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2506.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality.
  We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to 1.63x end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality.

arXiv:2506.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic classification of medical time series signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), plays a pivotal role in clinical decision support and early detection of diseases. Although Transformer based models have achieved notable performance by implicitly modeling temporal dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, their inherently complex architectures and opaque reasoning processes undermine their trustworthiness in high stakes clinical settings. In response to these limitations, this study shifts focus toward a modeling paradigm that emphasizes structural transparency, aligning more closely with the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. We propose a novel method, Channel Imposed Fusion (CIF), which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio through cross-channel information fusion, effectively reduces redundancy, and improves classification performance. Furthermore, we integrate CIF with the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), known for its structural simplicity and controllable receptive field, to construct an efficient and explicit classification framework. Experimental results on multiple publicly available EEG and ECG datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of various classification metrics, but also significantly enhances the transparency of the classification process, offering a novel perspective for medical time series classification.

Summary:<br />
The study proposes FSNet, a novel neural network aimed at efficiently solving constrained optimization problems while ensuring feasibility. By integrating a feasibility-seeking step into the solution procedure, FSNet minimizes constraint violations in a differentiable manner, allowing for end-to-end training. Experimental results across various optimization problems show that FSNet can provide feasible solutions at faster speeds with comparable or superior solution quality to traditional solvers. The model proves effective in handling smooth/nonsmooth, convex/nonconvex problems, demonstrating its versatility and efficiency in real-world applications. <div>
arXiv:2506.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently solving constrained optimization problems is crucial for numerous real-world applications, yet traditional solvers are often computationally prohibitive for real-time use. Machine learning-based approaches have emerged as a promising alternative to provide approximate solutions at faster speeds, but they struggle to strictly enforce constraints, leading to infeasible solutions in practice. To address this, we propose the Feasibility-Seeking-Integrated Neural Network (FSNet), which integrates a feasibility-seeking step directly into its solution procedure to ensure constraint satisfaction. This feasibility-seeking step solves an unconstrained optimization problem that minimizes constraint violations in a differentiable manner, enabling end-to-end training and providing guarantees on feasibility and convergence. Our experiments across a range of different optimization problems, including both smooth/nonsmooth and convex/nonconvex problems, demonstrate that FSNet can provide feasible solutions with solution quality comparable to (or in some cases better than) traditional solvers, at significantly faster speeds.

Summary: 
The study investigates the evolution of feature representations across layers in large language models (LLMs) using a data-oblivious approach. Critical layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs are identified by analyzing representation dynamics through Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). It is observed that layers experiencing significant shifts in representation space are most affected during fine-tuning, consistently across tasks for a given model. Spectral analysis reveals that these shifts are influenced by changes in the top principal components, representing semantic transitions. In practical applications, fine-tuning critical layers proves more effective for efficient domain adaptation, leading to greater loss reduction compared to non-critical layers. Additionally, freezing critical layers assists in backdoor defense, reducing attack success rates by up to 40%. <div>

Abstract: Understanding how feature representations evolve across layers in large language models (LLMs) is key to improving their interpretability and robustness. While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered Kernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions. We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain adaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction compared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them reduces attack success rates by up to 40%.

FarSight separates application semantics from memory layout, enabling offline-trained deep learning models to predict access patterns using a compact vocabulary. Through asynchronous inference, lookahead prediction, and cache-resident models, FarSight achieves high prediction accuracy with low runtime overhead. Evaluation on four data-intensive workloads shows FarSight outperforms existing far-memory systems by up to 3.6 times.

Abstract: Modern software systems face increasing runtime performance demands, particularly in emerging architectures like far memory, where local-memory misses incur significant latency. While machine learning (ML) has proven effective in offline systems optimization, its application to high-frequency, runtime-level problems remains limited due to strict performance, generalization, and integration constraints. We present FarSight, a Linux-based far-memory system that leverages deep learning (DL) to efficiently perform accurate data prefetching. FarSight separates application semantics from runtime memory layout, allowing offline-trained DL models to predict access patterns using a compact vocabulary of ordinal possibilities, resolved at runtime through lightweight mapping structures. By combining asynchronous inference, lookahead prediction, and a cache-resident DL model, FarSight achieves high prediction accuracy with low runtime overhead. Our evaluation of FarSight on four data-intensive workloads shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art far-memory system by up to 3.6 times. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying modern ML techniques to complex, performance-critical software runtime problems.

<div> Keywords: Preference-based reinforcement learning, human preferences, trajectory embedding space, unambiguous queries, CLARIFY<br />
Summary:<br />
Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) aims to infer reward functions from human preference comparisons, eliminating the need for explicit reward engineering. However, labeling clear preferences between similar segments is challenging for humans, leading to reduced label efficiency. In response to this, the offline PbRL method CLARIFY is introduced, which focuses on resolving ambiguous feedback by learning a trajectory embedding space that incorporates preference information. By ensuring clearly distinguished segments are spaced apart, CLARIFY facilitates the selection of more unambiguous queries. Experimental results show that CLARIFY outperforms baseline methods in scenarios with non-ideal teachers and real human feedback. This approach not only improves query selection but also results in meaningful trajectory embeddings. Overall, CLARIFY addresses the challenge of ambiguous feedback in PbRL, enhancing its practical applicability in real-world settings. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses explicit reward engineering by inferring reward functions from human preference comparisons, enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, humans often struggle to label a clear preference between similar segments, reducing label efficiency and limiting PbRL's real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an offline PbRL method: Contrastive LeArning for ResolvIng Ambiguous Feedback (CLARIFY), which learns a trajectory embedding space that incorporates preference information, ensuring clearly distinguished segments are spaced apart, thus facilitating the selection of more unambiguous queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLARIFY outperforms baselines in both non-ideal teachers and real human feedback settings. Our approach not only selects more distinguished queries but also learns meaningful trajectory embeddings.

<div> Framework, machine learning, generalization, bias, validation
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces the Adaptive Distribution Bridge (ADB) framework, which challenges traditional validation paradigms in machine learning. It demonstrates that higher in-distribution (ID) bias can actually lead to better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. By introducing controlled statistical diversity during training, ADB allows models to develop bias profiles that improve generalization across distributions. Empirical evaluations on various datasets show that ADB significantly enhances OOD generalization, with mean error reductions of up to 26.8% compared to traditional cross-validation. The framework also consistently identifies high-performing training strategies, with percentile ranks often exceeding 74.4%. This work provides a practical approach for improving generalization in machine learning models and offers a theoretical framework for reevaluating the role of bias in achieving robustness.

Abstract: Machine learning models often degrade when deployed on data distributions different from their training data. Challenging conventional validation paradigms, we demonstrate that higher in-distribution (ID) bias can lead to better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our Adaptive Distribution Bridge (ADB) framework implements this insight by introducing controlled statistical diversity during training, enabling models to develop bias profiles that effectively generalize across distributions. Empirically, we observe a robust negative correlation where higher ID bias corresponds to lower OOD error--a finding that contradicts standard practices focused on minimizing validation error. Evaluation on multiple datasets shows our approach significantly improves OOD generalization. ADB achieves robust mean error reductions of up to 26.8% compared to traditional cross-validation, and consistently identifies high-performing training strategies, evidenced by percentile ranks often exceeding 74.4%. Our work provides both a practical method for improving generalization and a theoretical framework for reconsidering the role of bias in robust machine learning.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular processes by enabling gene expression analysis at the individual cell level. Clustering allows for the identification of cell types and the further discovery of intrinsic patterns in single-cell data. However, the high dimensionality and sparsity of scRNA-seq data continue to challenge existing clustering models. In this paper, we introduce JojoSCL, a novel self-supervised contrastive learning framework for scRNA-seq clustering. By incorporating a shrinkage estimator based on hierarchical Bayesian estimation, which adjusts gene expression estimates towards more reliable cluster centroids to reduce intra-cluster dispersion, and optimized using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE), JojoSCL refines both instance-level and cluster-level contrastive learning. Experiments on ten scRNA-seq datasets substantiate that JojoSCL consistently outperforms prevalent clustering methods, with further validation of its practicality through robustness analysis and ablation studies.

arXiv:2506.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has attracted increasing attention to mitigate security and privacy challenges in traditional cloud-centric machine learning models specifically in healthcare ecosystems. FL methodologies enable the training of global models through localized policies, allowing independent operations at the edge clients' level. Conventional first-order FL approaches face several challenges in personalized model training due to heterogeneous non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data of each edge client. Recently, second-order FL approaches maintain the stability and consistency of non-iid datasets while improving personalized model training. This study proposes and develops a verifiable and auditable optimized second-order FL framework BFEL (blockchain-enhanced federated edge learning) based on optimized FedCurv for personalized healthcare systems. FedCurv incorporates information about the importance of each parameter to each client's task (through Fisher Information Matrix) which helps to preserve client-specific knowledge and reduce model drift during aggregation. Moreover, it minimizes communication rounds required to achieve a target precision convergence for each edge client while effectively managing personalized training on non-iid and heterogeneous data. The incorporation of Ethereum-based model aggregation ensures trust, verifiability, and auditability while public key encryption enhances privacy and security. Experimental results of federated CNNs and MLPs utilizing Mnist, Cifar-10, and PathMnist demonstrate the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework.

Summary:
The proposed MTAD-RD anomaly detection model addresses challenges in WSN anomaly detection by integrating spatiotemporal correlation features and implementing a two-stage training strategy. The model architecture includes a RetNet enhanced by a CR module, multigranular feature fusion, and a graph attention network module to extract internode correlation information for improved anomaly detection. A two-stage training approach involves a contrastive learning proxy task for unlabeled data and a sample sampler for addressing sample imbalance. In experiments on real datasets, the MTAD-RD method achieved a high F1 score of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection methods. The serialized inference characteristic of the model also helps reduce inference overhead, making it a reliable and efficient solution for detecting anomalies in WSN data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in the data collected by WSNs can provide crucial evidence for assessing the reliability and stability of WSNs. Existing methods for WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction of spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few anomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these issues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both model architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed. In terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network includes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR) module, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network module to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can integrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN neighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data. Moreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce inference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was designed. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series data with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to learn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive learning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the dataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples into few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was developed to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the problem of sample imbalance effectively. In experiments carried out on real public datasets, the designed MTAD-RD anomaly detection method achieved an F1 score of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection methods.

Summary:
COGNATE is a framework designed to optimize sparse tensor programs for specialized hardware accelerators. It addresses challenges such as sensitivity to input variations and reliance on expensive simulators. The framework leverages data samples from general-purpose hardware for cost model training, followed by fine-tuning on emerging hardware. By exploiting input feature homogeneity and mitigating heterogeneity, COGNATE achieves comparable performance to accelerator-specific models with just 5% of the data samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing techniques, with average speedups of 1.47x for SpMM and 1.39x for SDDMM. <div>

Abstract: Sparse tensor programs are essential in deep learning and graph analytics, driving the need for optimized processing. To meet this demand, specialized hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end, we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and 1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.

Summary: TIDFormer is introduced as a dynamic graph TransFormer that efficiently captures temporal and interactive dynamics. The self-attention mechanism (SAM) used is interpretable and effectively models changes in historical interaction patterns. Time partitioning information and interaction embeddings are utilized for bipartite and non-bipartite graphs, extracted from first-order neighbors. TIDFormer excels in performance compared to existing models on various dynamic graph datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, TIDFormer exhibits efficiency advantages over previous Transformer-based methods, making it a promising approach for dynamic graph modeling. <div>

Abstract: Due to the proficiency of self-attention mechanisms (SAMs) in capturing dependencies in sequence modeling, several existing dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) utilize Transformer architectures with various encoding designs to capture sequential evolutions of dynamic graphs. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these Transformer-based DGNNs vary significantly, highlighting the importance of properly defining the SAM on dynamic graphs and comprehensively encoding temporal and interactive dynamics without extra complex modules. In this work, we propose TIDFormer, a dynamic graph TransFormer that fully exploits Temporal and Interactive Dynamics in an efficient manner. We clarify and verify the interpretability of our proposed SAM, addressing the open problem of its uninterpretable definitions on dynamic graphs in previous works. To model the temporal and interactive dynamics, respectively, we utilize the calendar-based time partitioning information and extract informative interaction embeddings for both bipartite and non-bipartite graphs using merely the sampled first-order neighbors. In addition, we jointly model temporal and interactive features by capturing potential changes in historical interaction patterns through a simple decomposition. We conduct extensive experiments on several dynamic graph datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TIDFormer. The experimental results demonstrate that TIDFormer excels, outperforming state-of-the-art models across most datasets and experimental settings. Furthermore, TIDFormer exhibits significant efficiency advantages compared to previous Transformer-based methods.

Summary: 
Channel identifiability (CID) in time series (TS) modeling is crucial to distinguish between individual channels. A new normalization strategy called Channel Normalization (CN) enhances CID by assigning distinct parameters to each channel. Adaptive CN (ACN) adjusts parameters based on input TS, improving adaptability. Prototypical CN (PCN) uses learnable prototypes instead of per-channel parameters, making it applicable to datasets with unknown or varying channels. Applying CN and its variants to various TS models results in significant performance gains for both non-CID and CID models. The success of the approach is analyzed from an information theory perspective. To implement this approach, the code is available at https://github.com/seunghan96/CN. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Channel identifiability (CID) refers to the ability to distinguish between individual channels in time series (TS) modeling. The absence of CID often results in producing identical outputs for identical inputs, disregarding channel-specific characteristics. In this paper, we highlight the importance of CID and propose Channel Normalization (CN), a simple yet effective normalization strategy that enhances CID by assigning distinct affine transformation parameters to each channel. We further extend CN in two ways: 1) Adaptive CN (ACN) dynamically adjusts parameters based on the input TS, improving adaptability in TS models, and 2) Prototypical CN (PCN) introduces a set of learnable prototypes instead of per-channel parameters, enabling applicability to datasets with unknown or varying number of channels and facilitating use in TS foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CN and its variants by applying them to various TS models, achieving significant performance gains for both non-CID and CID models. In addition, we analyze the success of our approach from an information theory perspective. Code is available at https://github.com/seunghan96/CN.

- It addresses a scenario where a company can only observe customers who have made purchases and aims to market effectively to customers who lack loyalty.
- By focusing on individuals interested in a product but lacking loyalty, marketing efforts can be more efficient.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a method for identifying potential customers in targeted marketing by applying learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning). We consider a scenario in which a company sells a product and can observe only the customers who purchased it. Decision-makers seek to market products effectively based on whether people have loyalty to the company. Individuals with loyalty are those who are likely to remain interested in the company even without additional advertising. Consequently, those loyal customers would likely purchase from the company if they are interested in the product. In contrast, people with lower loyalty may overlook the product or buy similar products from other companies unless they receive marketing attention. Therefore, by focusing marketing efforts on individuals who are interested in the product but do not have strong loyalty, we can achieve more efficient marketing. To achieve this goal, we consider how to learn, from limited data, a classifier that identifies potential customers who (i) have interest in the product and (ii) do not have loyalty to the company. Although our algorithm comprises a single-stage optimization, its objective function implicitly contains two losses derived from standard PU learning settings. For this reason, we refer to our approach as double PU learning. We verify the validity of the proposed algorithm through numerical experiments, confirming that it functions appropriately for the problem at hand.

PointODE introduces a parameter-efficient ResNet-like architecture for point cloud feature extraction, utilizing Neural ODE to compress the model and handle non-uniform point distributions. The lightweight PointODE-Elite version with 0.58M parameters includes a dedicated FPGA accelerator that speeds up inference by 3.7x compared to a CPU, with 3.5x better energy efficiency. Despite its simplicity, PointODE-Elite achieves competitive accuracy on classification datasets, improving the trade-off between accuracy and inference cost. <div>
arXiv:2506.00438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedded edge devices are often used as a computing platform to run real-world point cloud applications, but recent deep learning-based methods may not fit on such devices due to limited resources. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by introducing PointODE, a parameter-efficient ResNet-like architecture for point cloud feature extraction based on a stack of MLP blocks with residual connections. We leverage Neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation), a continuous-depth version of ResNet originally developed for modeling the dynamics of continuous-time systems, to compress PointODE by reusing the same parameters across MLP blocks. The point-wise normalization is proposed for PointODE to handle the non-uniform distribution of feature points. We introduce PointODE-Elite as a lightweight version with 0.58M trainable parameters and design its dedicated accelerator for embedded FPGAs. The accelerator consists of a four-stage pipeline to parallelize the feature extraction for multiple points and stores the entire parameters on-chip to eliminate most of the off-chip data transfers. Compared to the ARM Cortex-A53 CPU, the accelerator implemented on a Xilinx ZCU104 board speeds up the feature extraction by 4.9x, leading to 3.7x faster inference and 3.5x better energy-efficiency. Despite the simple architecture, PointODE-Elite shows competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art models on both synthetic and real-world classification datasets, greatly improving the trade-off between accuracy and inference cost.

Abstract: Ensembling large language models (LLMs) can effectively combine diverse strengths of different models, offering a promising approach to enhance performance across various tasks. However, existing methods typically rely on fixed weighting strategies that fail to adapt to the dynamic, context-dependent characteristics of LLM capabilities. In this work, we propose Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Ensemble for LLMs (RLAE), a novel framework that reformulates LLM ensemble through the lens of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach introduces a RL agent that dynamically adjusts ensemble weights by considering both input context and intermediate generation states, with the agent being trained using rewards that directly correspond to the quality of final outputs. We implement RLAE using both single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms ($\text{RLAE}_\text{PPO}$ and $\text{RLAE}_\text{MAPPO}$ ), demonstrating substantial improvements over conventional ensemble methods. Extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks show that RLAE outperforms existing approaches by up to $3.3\%$ accuracy points, offering a more effective framework for LLM ensembling. Furthermore, our method exhibits superior generalization capabilities across different tasks without the need for retraining, while simultaneously achieving lower time latency.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning (ML) model training while preserving data privacy by keeping data localized across clients. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients poses a significant challenge, leading to skewed model updates and performance degradation. Addressing this, we propose PSI-PFL, a novel client selection framework for Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) that leverages the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify and mitigate data heterogeneity (so-called non-IIDness). Our approach selects more homogeneous clients based on PSI, reducing the impact of label skew, one of the most detrimental factors in FL performance. Experimental results over multiple data modalities (tabular, image, text) demonstrate that PSI-PFL significantly improves global model accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10\% under non-IID scenarios while ensuring fairer local performance. PSI-PFL enhances FL performance and offers practical benefits in applications where data privacy and heterogeneity are critical.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs evolve continuously, presenting challenges for traditional graph learning due to their changing structures and temporal dependencies. Recent advancements have shown potential in addressing these challenges by developing suitable meta-learning-based dynamic graph neural network models. However, most meta-learning approaches for dynamic graphs rely on fixed weight update parameters, neglecting the essential intrinsic complex high-order topological information of dynamically evolving graphs. We have designed Dowker Zigzag Persistence (DZP), an efficient and stable dynamic graph persistent homology representation method based on Dowker complex and zigzag persistence, to capture the high-order features of dynamic graphs. Armed with the DZP ideas, we propose TMetaNet, a new meta-learning parameter update model based on dynamic topological features. By utilizing the distances between high-order topological features, TMetaNet enables more effective adaptation across snapshots. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate TMetaNet's state-of-the-art performance and resilience to graph noise, illustrating its high potential for meta-learning and dynamic graph analysis.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, zero-shot forecasting, state-of-the-art models, sensitivity to noise, fine-tuning<br />
Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great performance in various tasks but struggle as zero-shot forecasters due to sensitivity to noise. Recent studies indicate LLMs may not be as effective in forecasting compared to domain-specific models. The study evaluates LLMs as zero-shot forecasters and finds they often underperform even simple domain-specific models. Solutions to reduce sensitivity to noise in LLMs have been explored but remain challenging. It is suggested that instead of focusing on zero-shot forecasting, fine-tuning LLMs for better processing of numerical sequences shows more promise. The experimental code is available for further exploration. The findings highlight the need for rigorous validation when assessing the effectiveness of LLMs in forecasting tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks without domain-specific training, fueling interest in their potential for time-series forecasting. While LLMs have shown potential in zero-shot forecasting through prompting alone, recent studies suggest that LLMs lack inherent effectiveness in forecasting. Given these conflicting findings, a rigorous validation is essential for drawing reliable conclusions. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs as zero-shot forecasters compared to state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our experiments show that LLM-based zero-shot forecasters often struggle to achieve high accuracy due to their sensitivity to noise, underperforming even simple domain-specific models. We have explored solutions to reduce LLMs' sensitivity to noise in the zero-shot setting, but improving their robustness remains a significant challenge. Our findings suggest that rather than emphasizing zero-shot forecasting, a more promising direction would be to focus on fine-tuning LLMs to better process numerical sequences.

Abstract: Hanabi has become a popular game for research when it comes to reinforcement learning (RL) as it is one of the few cooperative card games where you have incomplete knowledge of the entire environment, thus presenting a challenge for a RL agent. We explored different tabular and deep reinforcement learning algorithms to see which had the best performance both against an agent of the same type and also against other types of agents. We establish that certain agents played their highest scoring games against specific agents while others exhibited higher scores on average by adapting to the opposing agent's behavior. We attempted to quantify the conditions under which each algorithm provides the best advantage and identified the most interesting interactions between agents of different types. In the end, we found that temporal difference (TD) algorithms had better overall performance and balancing of play types compared to tabular agents. Specifically, tabular Expected SARSA and deep Q-Learning agents showed the best performance.

Abstract: We aim to better understand the tradeoffs between traditional and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for energy storage management. More specifically, we wish to better understand the performance loss incurred when using a generative RL policy instead of using a traditional approach to find optimal control policies for specific instances. Our comparison is based on a simplified micro-grid model, that includes a load component, a photovoltaic source, and a storage device. Based on this model, we examine three use cases of increasing complexity: ideal storage with convex cost functions, lossy storage devices, and lossy storage devices with convex transmission losses. With the aim of promoting the principled use RL based methods in this challenging and important domain, we provide a detailed formulation of each use case and a detailed description of the optimization challenges. We then compare the performance of traditional and RL methods, discuss settings in which it is beneficial to use each method, and suggest avenues for future investigation.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel framework called Self-training with Self-adaptive Thresholding (SST) for semi-supervised learning (SSL) utilizing a Self-Adaptive Thresholding (SAT) mechanism to adjust class-specific thresholds based on the model's learning progress.

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated exceptional performance in supervised learning, benefiting from abundant high-quality annotated data. However, obtaining such data in real-world scenarios is costly and labor-intensive. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to this problem. Recent studies, such as Semi-ViT and Noisy Student, which employ consistency regularization or pseudo-labeling, have demonstrated significant achievements. However, they still face challenges, particularly in accurately selecting sufficient high-quality pseudo-labels due to their reliance on fixed thresholds. Recent methods such as FlexMatch and FreeMatch have introduced flexible or self-adaptive thresholding techniques, greatly advancing SSL research. Nonetheless, their process of updating thresholds at each iteration is deemed time-consuming, computationally intensive, and potentially unnecessary. To address these issues, we propose Self-training with Self-adaptive Thresholding (SST), a novel, effective, and efficient SSL framework. SST introduces an innovative Self-Adaptive Thresholding (SAT) mechanism that adaptively adjusts class-specific thresholds based on the model's learning progress. SAT ensures the selection of high-quality pseudo-labeled data, mitigating the risks of inaccurate pseudo-labels and confirmation bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SST achieves state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency, generalization, and scalability across various architectures and datasets. Semi-SST-ViT-Huge achieves the best results on competitive ImageNet-1K SSL benchmarks, with 80.7% / 84.9% Top-1 accuracy using only 1% / 10% labeled data. Compared to the fully-supervised DeiT-III-ViT-Huge, which achieves 84.8% Top-1 accuracy using 100% labeled data, our method demonstrates superior performance using only 10% labeled data.

Summary: 
The paper introduces ModelNet, a novel image classification dataset created from embeddings of a pre-trained ResNet50 model. The dataset includes three client-specific variants with different domain heterogeneities (homogeneous, heterogeneous, random) to simulate realistic Federated Learning (FL) settings. The paper proposes a new FL algorithm that accesses anonymized model parameters to enhance local privacy protection. This dataset aims to address the lack of domain heterogeneity and client-specific segregation in FL benchmarks. ModelNet-S, ModelNet-D, and ModelNet-R cater to homogeneous, heterogeneous, and random data settings, respectively, making it the first cross-environment client-specific FL dataset. The paper conducts extensive experiments on domain shifts and aggregation strategies, showcasing the effectiveness of the dataset for both classical and graph-based FL research. The dataset and code are openly available for further exploration and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed data sources while preserving data locality. However, the privacy of local data is always a pivotal concern and has received a lot of attention in recent research on the FL regime. Moreover, the lack of domain heterogeneity and client-specific segregation in the benchmarks remains a critical bottleneck for rigorous evaluation. In this paper, we introduce ModelNet, a novel image classification dataset constructed from the embeddings extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 model. First, we modify the CIFAR100 dataset into three client-specific variants, considering three domain heterogeneities (homogeneous, heterogeneous, and random). Subsequently, we train each client-specific subset of all three variants on the pre-trained ResNet50 model to save model parameters. In addition to multi-domain image data, we propose a new hypothesis to define the FL algorithm that can access the anonymized model parameters to preserve the local privacy in a more effective manner compared to existing ones. ModelNet is designed to simulate realistic FL settings by incorporating non-IID data distributions and client diversity design principles in the mainframe for both conventional and futuristic graph-driven FL algorithms. The three variants are ModelNet-S, ModelNet-D, and ModelNet-R, which are based on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and random data settings, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a cross-environment client-specific FL dataset along with the graph-based variant. Extensive experiments based on domain shifts and aggregation strategies show the effectiveness of the above variants, making it a practical benchmark for classical and graph-based FL research. The dataset and related code are available online.

<title>Flashbacks to Harmonize Stability and Plasticity in Continual Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00477</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Flashback Learning (FL), a novel method designed to harmonize the stability and plasticity of models in Continual Learning (CL). Unlike prior approaches that primarily focus on regularizing model updates to preserve old information while learning new concepts, FL explicitly balances this trade-off through a bidirectional form of regularization. This approach effectively guides the model to swiftly incorporate new knowledge while actively retaining its old knowledge. FL operates through a two-phase training process and can be seamlessly integrated into various CL methods, including replay, parameter regularization, distillation, and dynamic architecture techniques. In designing FL, we use two distinct knowledge bases: one to enhance plasticity and another to improve stability. FL ensures a more balanced model by utilizing both knowledge bases to regularize model updates. Theoretically, we analyze how the FL mechanism enhances the stability-plasticity balance. Empirically, FL demonstrates tangible improvements over baseline methods within the same training budget. By integrating FL into at least one representative baseline from each CL category, we observed an average accuracy improvement of up to 4.91% in Class-Incremental and 3.51% in Task-Incremental settings on standard image classification benchmarks. Additionally, measurements of the stability-to-plasticity ratio confirm that FL effectively enhances this balance. FL also outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods on more challenging datasets like ImageNet.

<title>Dynamic Domain Adaptation-Driven Physics-Informed Graph Representation Learning for AC-OPF</title>

Abstract: Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) aims to optimize generator power outputs by utilizing the non-linear relationships between voltage magnitudes and phase angles in a power system. However, current AC-OPF solvers struggle to effectively represent the complex relationship between variable distributions in the constraint space and their corresponding optimal solutions. This limitation in constraint modeling restricts the system's ability to develop diverse knowledge representations. Additionally, modeling the power grid solely based on spatial topology further limits the integration of additional prior knowledge, such as temporal information. To overcome these challenges, we propose DDA-PIGCN (Dynamic Domain Adaptation-Driven Physics-Informed Graph Convolutional Network), a new method designed to address constraint-related issues and build a graph-based learning framework that incorporates spatiotemporal features. DDA-PIGCN improves consistency optimization for features with varying long-range dependencies by applying multi-layer, hard physics-informed constraints. It also uses a dynamic domain adaptation learning mechanism that iteratively updates and refines key state variables under predefined constraints, enabling precise constraint verification. Moreover, it captures spatiotemporal dependencies between generators and loads by leveraging the physical structure of the power grid, allowing for deep integration of topological information across time and space. Extensive comparative and ablation studies show that DDA-PIGCN delivers strong performance across several IEEE standard test cases (such as case9, case30, and case300), achieving mean absolute errors (MAE) from 0.0011 to 0.0624 and constraint satisfaction rates between 99.6% and 100%, establishing it as a reliable and efficient AC-OPF solver.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for up-to-date and well-organized benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. However, many existing datasets are scattered, difficult to manage, and make it challenging to perform evaluations tailored to specific needs or domains, despite the growing importance of domain-specific models in areas such as math or code. In this paper, we introduce BenchHub, a dynamic benchmark repository that empowers researchers and developers to evaluate LLMs more effectively. BenchHub aggregates and automatically classifies benchmark datasets from diverse domains, integrating 303K questions across 38 benchmarks. It is designed to support continuous updates and scalable data management, enabling flexible and customizable evaluation tailored to various domains or use cases. Through extensive experiments with various LLM families, we demonstrate that model performance varies significantly across domain-specific subsets, emphasizing the importance of domain-aware benchmarking. We believe BenchHub can encourage better dataset reuse, more transparent model comparisons, and easier identification of underrepresented areas in existing benchmarks, offering a critical infrastructure for advancing LLM evaluation research.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in the research and deployment of large language models (LLMs), the statistical distribution of model parameters, as well as their influence on initialization, training dynamics, and downstream efficiency, has received surprisingly little attention. A recent work introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1) GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2) DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy. Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard training baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical modeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware AI systems. The code is available on our project page: https://huggingface.co/spaces/shifeng3711/gg_prior.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a widely adopted strategy for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, significantly reducing memory and computational costs. However, most existing PEFT techniques uniformly deploy LoRA adapters across all layers, disregarding the intrinsic heterogeneity of layer contributions and task-specific rank requirements. This uniform paradigm leads to redundant parameter allocation and suboptimal adaptation efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose FLoE, a novel PEFT framework that introduces two key innovations: (i) a Fisher information-guided importance scoring mechanism to dynamically identify task-critical transformer layers for MoE-based low-rank adaptation, enabling sparse adapter deployment; and (ii) a Bayesian optimization-driven rank allocator that automatically determines optimal LoRA ranks on specific datasets without exhaustive grid search. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and benchmarks reveal that FLoE achieves impressive efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, making FLoE particularly advantageous in resource-constrained environments that necessitate rapid adaptation.

<title>Federated learning framework for collaborative remaining useful life prognostics: an aircraft engine case study</title>

Abstract: Complex systems such as aircraft engines are continuously monitored by sensors. In predictive aircraft maintenance, the collected sensor measurements are used to estimate the health condition and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of such systems. However, a major challenge when developing prognostics is the limited number of run-to-failure data samples. This challenge could be overcome if multiple airlines would share their run-to-failure data samples such that sufficient learning can be achieved. Due to privacy concerns, however, airlines are reluctant to share their data in a centralized setting. In this paper, a collaborative federated learning framework is therefore developed instead. Here, several airlines cooperate to train a collective RUL prognostic machine learning model, without the need to centrally share their data. For this, a decentralized validation procedure is proposed to validate the prognostics model without sharing any data. Moreover, sensor data is often noisy and of low quality. This paper therefore proposes four novel methods to aggregate the parameters of the global prognostic model. These methods enhance the robustness of the FL framework against noisy data. The proposed framework is illustrated for training a collaborative RUL prognostic model for aircraft engines, using the N-CMAPSS dataset. Here, six airlines are considered, that collaborate in the FL framework to train a collective RUL prognostic model for their aircraft's engines. When comparing the proposed FL framework with the case where each airline independently develops their own prognostic model, the results show that FL leads to more accurate RUL prognostics for five out of the six airlines. Moreover, the novel robust aggregation methods render the FL framework robust to noisy data samples.

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending enables permissionless borrowing via smart contracts. However, it faces challenges in optimizing interest rates, mitigating bad debt, and improving capital efficiency. Rule-based interest-rate models struggle to adapt to dynamic market conditions, leading to inefficiencies. This work applies Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize interest rate adjustments in DeFi lending protocols. Using historical data from Aave protocol, we evaluate three RL approaches: Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), Behavior Cloning (BC), and TD3 with Behavior Cloning (TD3-BC). TD3-BC demonstrates superior performance in balancing utilization, capital stability, and risk, outperforming existing models. It adapts effectively to historical stress events like the May 2021 crash and the March 2023 USDC depeg, showcasing potential for automated, real-time governance.

Abstract: Many modern search domains comprise high-dimensional vectors of floating point numbers derived from neural networks, in the form of embeddings. Typical embeddings range in size from hundreds to thousands of dimensions, making the size of the embeddings, and the speed of comparison, a significant issue.
  Quantisation is a class of mechanism which replaces the floating point values with a smaller representation, for example a short integer. This gives an approximation of the embedding space in return for a smaller data representation and a faster comparison function.
  Here we take this idea almost to its extreme: we show how vectors of arbitrary-precision floating point values can be replaced by vectors whose elements are drawn from the set {-1,0,1}. This yields very significant savings in space and metric evaluation cost, while maintaining a strong correlation for similarity measurements.
  This is achieved by way of a class of convex polytopes which exist in the high-dimensional space. In this article we give an outline description of these objects, and show how they can be used for the basis of such radical quantisation while maintaining a surprising degree of accuracy.

Abstract: The integration of wind energy into power grids necessitates accurate ultra-short-term wind power forecasting to ensure grid stability and optimize resource allocation. This study introduces M2WLLM, an innovative model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting wind power output at granular time intervals. M2WLLM overcomes the limitations of traditional and deep learning methods by seamlessly integrating textual information and temporal numerical data, significantly improving wind power forecasting accuracy through multi-modal data. Its architecture features a Prompt Embedder and a Data Embedder, enabling an effective fusion of textual prompts and numerical inputs within the LLMs framework. The Semantic Augmenter within the Data Embedder translates temporal data into a format that the LLMs can comprehend, enabling it to extract latent features and improve prediction accuracy. The empirical evaluations conducted on wind farm data from three Chinese provinces demonstrate that M2WLLM consistently outperforms existing methods, such as GPT4TS, across various datasets and prediction horizons. The results highlight LLMs' ability to enhance accuracy and robustness in ultra-short-term forecasting and showcase their strong few-shot learning capabilities.

<title>RsGCN: Rescaling Enhances Generalization of GCNs for Solving Scalable Traveling Salesman Problems</title>

Abstract: Neural traveling salesman problem (TSP) solvers face two critical challenges: poor generalization for scalable TSPs and high training costs. To address these challenges, we propose a new Rescaling Graph Convolutional Network (RsGCN). Focusing on the scale-dependent features (i.e., features varied with problem scales) related to nodes and edges that influence the sensitivity of GCNs to the problem scales, a Rescaling Mechanism in RsGCN enhances the generalization capability by (1) rescaling adjacent nodes to construct a subgraph with a uniform number of adjacent nodes for each node across various scales of TSPs, which stabilizes the graph message aggregation; (2) rescaling subgraph edges to adjust the lengths of subgraph edges to the same magnitude, which maintains numerical consistency. In addition, an efficient training strategy with a mixed-scale dataset and bidirectional loss is used in RsGCN. To fully exploit the heatmaps generated by RsGCN, we design an efficient post-search algorithm termed Re2Opt, in which a reconstruction process based on adaptive weight is incorporated to help avoid local optima. Based on a combined architecture of RsGCN and Re2Opt, our solver achieves remarkable generalization and low training cost: with only 3 epochs of training on the mixed-scale dataset containing instances with up to 100 nodes, it can be generalized successfully to 10K-node instances without any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance across uniform distribution instances of 9 different scales from 20 to 10K nodes and 78 real-world instances from TSPLIB, while requiring the fewest learnable parameters and training epochs among neural competitors.

<title>Imputation of Missing Data in Smooth Pursuit Eye Movements Using a Self-Attention-based Deep Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: Missing data is a relevant issue in time series, especially in biomedical sequences such as those corresponding to smooth pursuit eye movements, which often contain gaps due to eye blinks and track losses, complicating the analysis and extraction of meaningful biomarkers. In this paper, a novel imputation framework is proposed using Self-Attention-based Imputation networks for time series, which leverages the power of deep learning and self-attention mechanisms to impute missing data. We further refine the imputed data using a custom made autoencoder, tailored to represent smooth pursuit eye movement sequences. The proposed approach was implemented using 5,504 sequences from 172 Parkinsonian patients and healthy controls. Results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed eye movement sequences with respect to other state of the art techniques, substantially reducing the values for common time domain error metrics such as the mean absolute error, mean relative error, and root mean square error, while also preserving the signal's frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness when large intervals of data are missing. This method offers an alternative solution for robustly handling missing data in time series, enhancing the reliability of smooth pursuit analysis for the screening and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.

Abstract: A key approach to state abstraction is approximating behavioral metrics (notably, bisimulation metrics) in the observation space and embedding these learned distances in the representation space. While promising for robustness to task-irrelevant noise, as shown in prior work, accurately estimating these metrics remains challenging, requiring various design choices that create gaps between theory and practice. Prior evaluations focus mainly on final returns, leaving the quality of learned metrics and the source of performance gains unclear. To systematically assess how metric learning works in deep reinforcement learning (RL), we evaluate five recent approaches, unified conceptually as isometric embeddings with varying design choices. We benchmark them with baselines across 20 state-based and 14 pixel-based tasks, spanning 370 task configurations with diverse noise settings. Beyond final returns, we introduce the evaluation of a denoising factor to quantify the encoder's ability to filter distractions. To further isolate the effect of metric learning, we propose and evaluate an isolated metric estimation setting, in which the encoder is influenced solely by the metric loss. Finally, we release an open-source, modular codebase to improve reproducibility and support future research on metric learning in deep RL.

<title>AutoMixAlign: Adaptive Data Mixing for Multi-Task Preference Optimization in LLMs</title>

Abstract: When aligning large language models (LLMs), their performance on various tasks (such as being helpful, harmless, and honest) depends heavily on the composition of their training data. However, selecting a data mixture that achieves strong performance across all tasks is challenging. Existing approaches rely on large ablation studies, heuristics, or human intuition, but these can be prohibitively expensive and suboptimal. We study this problem in the setting of preference optimization via DPO and introduce AutoMixAlign (AMA), a theoretically-grounded algorithm that adaptively mixes datasets during training to balance performance across tasks. AMA first trains \textit{specialist models} for each task to determine losses that correspond to strong task performance. Then, it trains a generalist model using a novel minimax optimization that prioritizes tasks for which generalist model losses deviate most from specialist model losses. To optimize this problem, we propose two algorithms: (1) AMA-R, which adaptively reweights the objective to prioritize tasks, and (2) AMA-S, which adaptively adjusts how much data is sampled from each task to prioritize tasks. Both algorithms achieve a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ in the convex case. AMA-R's convergence result follows from Sagawa et al. (2019), and we provide a convergence proof for AMA-S using online learning techniques such as EXP3. We evaluate AMA on several multitask alignment setups and find that AMA outperforms the standard alignment approach -- which simply optimizes the total loss across all tasks -- and also outperforms model merging methods.

<title>Neural Estimation for Scaling Entropic Multimarginal Optimal Transport</title>

Abstract: Multimarginal optimal transport (MOT) is a powerful framework for modeling interactions between multiple distributions, yet its applicability is bottlenecked by a high computational overhead. Entropic regularization provides computational speedups via the multimarginal Sinkhorn algorithm, whose time complexity, for a dataset size $n$ and $k$ marginals, generally scales as $O(n^k)$. However, this dependence on the dataset size $n$ is computationally prohibitive for many machine learning problems. In this work, we propose a new computational framework for entropic MOT, dubbed Neural Entropic MOT (NEMOT), that enjoys significantly improved scalability. NEMOT employs neural networks trained using mini-batches, which transfers the computational complexity from the dataset size to the size of the mini-batch, leading to substantial gains. We provide formal guarantees on the accuracy of NEMOT via non-asymptotic error bounds. We supplement these with numerical results that demonstrate the performance gains of NEMOT over Sinkhorn's algorithm, as well as extensions to neural computation of multimarginal entropic Gromov-Wasserstein alignment. In particular, orders-of-magnitude speedups are observed relative to the state-of-the-art, with a notable increase in the feasible number of samples and marginals. NEMOT seamlessly integrates as a module in large-scale machine learning pipelines, and can serve to expand the practical applicability of entropic MOT for tasks involving multimarginal data.

Abstract: Modern wireless networks must adapt to dynamic conditions while efficiently managing diverse service demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) struggles in these environments, as scattered and evolving feedback makes optimal decision-making challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution by structuring unorganized network feedback into meaningful latent representations, helping RL agents recognize patterns more effectively. For example, in O-RAN slicing, concepts like SNR, power levels and throughput are semantically related, and LLMs can naturally cluster them, providing a more interpretable state representation. To leverage this capability, we introduce a contextualization-based adaptation method that integrates learnable prompts into an LLM-augmented DRL framework. Instead of relying on full model fine-tuning, we refine state representations through task-specific prompts that dynamically adjust to network conditions. Utilizing ORANSight, an LLM trained on O-RAN knowledge, we develop Prompt-Augmented Multi agent RL (PA-MRL) framework. Learnable prompts optimize both semantic clustering and RL objectives, allowing RL agents to achieve higher rewards in fewer iterations and adapt more efficiently. By incorporating prompt-augmented learning, our approach enables faster, more scalable, and adaptive resource allocation in O-RAN slicing. Experimental results show that it accelerates convergence and outperforms other baselines.

Abstract: Advanced wireless networks must support highly dynamic and heterogeneous service demands. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables this flexibility by adopting modular, disaggregated components, such as the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), Centralized Unit (CU), and Distributed Unit (DU), that can support intelligent control via machine learning (ML). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for managing dynamic resource allocation and slicing, it often struggles to process raw, unstructured input like RF features, QoS metrics, and traffic trends. These limitations hinder policy generalization and decision efficiency in partially observable and evolving environments. To address this, we propose \textit{ORAN-GUIDE}, a dual-LLM framework that enhances multi-agent RL (MARL) with task-relevant, semantically enriched state representations. The architecture employs a domain-specific language model, ORANSight, pretrained on O-RAN control and configuration data, to generate structured, context-aware prompts. These prompts are fused with learnable tokens and passed to a frozen GPT-based encoder that outputs high-level semantic representations for DRL agents. This design adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style pipeline tailored for technical decision-making in wireless systems. Experimental results show that ORAN-GUIDE improves sample efficiency, policy convergence, and performance generalization over standard MARL and single-LLM baselines.

Abstract: This work presents a novel probabilistic interpretation of Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) through the lens of variational inference. Unlike prior formulations that recover linear SFA from Gaussian state-space models with linear emissions, this approach relaxes the key constraint of linearity. While it does not lead to full equivalence to non-linear SFA, it recasts the classical slowness objective in a variational framework. Specifically, it allows the slowness objective to be interpreted as a regularizer to a reconstruction loss. Furthermore, we provide arguments, why -- from the perspective of slowness optimization -- the reconstruction loss takes on the role of the constraints that ensure informativeness in SFA. We conclude with a discussion of potential new research directions.

Abstract: Stress significantly contributes to both mental and physical disorders, yet traditional self-reported questionnaires are inherently subjective. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that employs geometric machine learning to detect stress from raw EEG recordings. Our approach constructs graphs by integrating structural connectivity (derived from electrode spatial arrangement) with functional connectivity from pairwise signal correlations. A spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) processes these graphs to capture spatial and temporal dynamics. Experiments on the SAM-40 dataset show that the ST-GCN outperforms standard machine learning models on all key classification metrics and enhances interpretability, explored through ablation analyses of key channels and brain regions. These results pave the way for more objective and accurate stress detection methods.

Abstract: In this pilot study, we propose a neuro-inspired approach that compresses temporal sequences into context-tagged chunks, where each tag represents a recurring structural unit or``community'' in the sequence. These tags are generated during an offline sleep phase and serve as compact references to past experience, allowing the learner to incorporate information beyond its immediate input range. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that temporal chunking can significantly enhance learning efficiency under resource constrained settings. A small-scale human pilot study using a Serial Reaction Time Task further motivates the idea of structural abstraction. Although limited to synthetic tasks, this work serves as an early proof-of-concept, with initial evidence that learned context tags can transfer across related task, offering potential for future applications in transfer learning.

Abstract: Plasticity, or the ability of an agent to adapt to new tasks, environments, or distributions, is crucial for continual learning. In this paper, we study the loss of plasticity in deep continual RL from the lens of churn: network output variability for out-of-batch data induced by mini-batch training. We demonstrate that (1) the loss of plasticity is accompanied by the exacerbation of churn due to the gradual rank decrease of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrix; (2) reducing churn helps prevent rank collapse and adjusts the step size of regular RL gradients adaptively. Moreover, we introduce Continual Churn Approximated Reduction (C-CHAIN) and demonstrate it improves learning performance and outperforms baselines in a diverse range of continual learning environments on OpenAI Gym Control, ProcGen, DeepMind Control Suite, and MinAtar benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of reliable anomaly-labeled datasets, driving the development of unsupervised methods. Graph autoencoders (GAEs) have emerged as a dominant approach by reconstructing graph structures and node features while deriving anomaly scores from reconstruction errors. However, relying solely on reconstruction error for anomaly detection has limitations, as it increases the sensitivity to noise and overfitting. To address these issues, we propose Graph Evidential Learning (GEL), a probabilistic framework that redefines the reconstruction process through evidential learning. By modeling node features and graph topology using evidential distributions, GEL quantifies two types of uncertainty: graph uncertainty and reconstruction uncertainty, incorporating them into the anomaly scoring mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEL achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high robustness against noise and structural perturbations.

Abstract: Real-world multichannel time series prediction faces growing demands for efficiency across edge and cloud environments, making channel compression a timely and essential problem. Motivated by success of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) methods, we propose a predictability-aware compression-decompression framework to reduce runtime, lower communication cost, and maintain prediction accuracy across diverse predictors. The core idea involves using a circular periodicity key matrix with orthogonality to capture underlying time series predictability during compression and to mitigate reconstruction errors during decompression by relaxing oversimplified data assumptions. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that the proposed framework is both time-efficient and scalable under a large number of channels. Extensive experiments on six datasets across various predictors demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior overall performance by jointly considering prediction accuracy and runtime, while maintaining strong compatibility with diverse predictors.

Abstract: Model Reprogramming (MR) is a resource-efficient framework that adapts large pre-trained models to new tasks with minimal additional parameters and data, offering a promising solution to the challenges of training large models for diverse tasks. Despite its empirical success across various domains such as computer vision and time-series forecasting, the theoretical foundations of MR remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of MR through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework. We demonstrate that the success of MR is governed by the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK matrix on the target dataset and establish the critical role of the source model's effectiveness in determining reprogramming outcomes. Our contributions include a novel theoretical framework for MR, insights into the relationship between source and target models, and extensive experiments validating our findings.

Abstract: Decision-making in building energy systems critically depends on the predictive accuracy of relevant time-series models. In scenarios lacking extensive data from a target building, foundation models (FMs) represent a promising technology that can leverage prior knowledge from vast and diverse pre-training datasets to construct accurate probabilistic predictors for use in decision-making tools. This paper investigates the applicability and fine-tuning strategies of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) in building energy forecasting. We analyze both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, particularly low-rank adaptation (LoRA), by using real-world data from a commercial net-zero energy building to capture signals such as room occupancy, carbon emissions, plug loads, and HVAC energy consumption. Our analysis reveals that the zero-shot predictive performance of TSFMs is generally suboptimal. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that employing either full fine-tuning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning significantly enhances forecasting accuracy, even with limited historical data. Notably, fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) substantially reduces computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, fine-tuned TSFMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art deep forecasting models (e.g., temporal fusion transformers) in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across varying building zones and seasonal conditions. These results underline the efficacy of TSFMs for practical, data-constrained building energy management systems, enabling improved decision-making in pursuit of energy efficiency and sustainability.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in many domains, such as transportation, meteorology, and energy. However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved substantial success across various scientific computing tasks. A pivotal challenge within this domain is the rapid and parallel approximation of matrix inverses, critical for numerous applications. Despite significant progress, there currently exists no universal neural-based method for approximating matrix inversion. This paper presents a theoretical analysis demonstrating the fundamental limitations of neural networks in developing a general matrix inversion model. We expand the class of Lipschitz functions to encompass a wider array of neural network models, thereby refining our theoretical approach. Moreover, we delineate specific conditions under which neural networks can effectively approximate matrix inverses. Our theoretical results are supported by experimental results from diverse matrix datasets, exploring the efficacy of neural networks in addressing the matrix inversion challenge.

arXiv:2506.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models, regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding representation alignment across model scales.

Abstract: We propose a permutation-invariant neural architecture for indoor localization using RSSI scans from Wi-Fi access points. Each scan is modeled as an unordered set of (BSSID, RSSI) pairs, where BSSIDs are mapped to learned embeddings and concatenated with signal strength. These are processed by a Set Transformer, enabling the model to handle variable-length, sparse inputs while learning attention- based representations over access point relationships. We evaluate the model on a dataset collected across a campus environment consisting of six buildings. Results show that the model accurately recovers fine-grained spatial structure and maintains performance across physically distinct domains. In our experiments, a simple LSTM consistently outperformed all other models, achieving the lowest mean localization error across three tasks (E1 - E3), with average errors as low as 2.23 m. The Set Transformer performed competitively, ranking second in every experiment and outperforming the MLP, RNN, and basic attention models, particularly in scenarios involving multiple buildings (E2) and multiple floors (E3). Performance degraded most in E2, where signal conditions varied substantially across buildings, highlighting the importance of architectural robustness to domain diversity. This work demonstrates that set-based neural models are a natural fit for signal-based localization, offering a principled approach to handling sparse, unordered inputs in real-world positioning tasks.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a key technique for protecting sensitive patient data in medical deep learning (DL). As clinical models grow more data-dependent, balancing privacy with utility and fairness has become a critical challenge. This scoping review synthesizes recent developments in applying DP to medical DL, with a particular focus on DP-SGD and alternative mechanisms across centralized and federated settings. Using a structured search strategy, we identified 74 studies published up to March 2025. Our analysis spans diverse data modalities, training setups, and downstream tasks, and highlights the tradeoffs between privacy guarantees, model accuracy, and subgroup fairness. We find that while DP-especially at strong privacy budgets-can preserve performance in well-structured imaging tasks, severe degradation often occurs under strict privacy, particularly in underrepresented or complex modalities. Furthermore, privacy-induced performance gaps disproportionately affect demographic subgroups, with fairness impacts varying by data type and task. A small subset of studies explicitly addresses these tradeoffs through subgroup analysis or fairness metrics, but most omit them entirely. Beyond DP-SGD, emerging approaches leverage alternative mechanisms, generative models, and hybrid federated designs, though reporting remains inconsistent. We conclude by outlining key gaps in fairness auditing, standardization, and evaluation protocols, offering guidance for future work toward equitable and clinically robust privacy-preserving DL systems in medicine.

<title>SafeTuneBed: A Toolkit for Benchmarking LLM Safety Alignment in Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and safety-first defenses have proliferated rapidly. However, the number of approaches and their recent increase have resulted in diverse evaluations-varied datasets, metrics, and inconsistent threat settings-making it difficult to fairly compare safety, utility, and robustness across methods. To address this, we introduce SafeTuneBed, a benchmark and toolkit unifying fine-tuning and defense evaluation. SafeTuneBed (i) curates a diverse repository of multiple fine-tuning datasets spanning sentiment analysis, question-answering, multi-step reasoning, and open-ended instruction tasks, and allows for the generation of harmful-variant splits; (ii) enables integration of state-of-the-art defenses, including alignment-stage immunization, in-training safeguards, and post-tuning repair; and (iii) provides evaluators for safety (attack success rate, refusal consistency) and utility. Built on Python-first, dataclass-driven configs and plugins, SafeTuneBed requires minimal additional code to specify any fine-tuning regime, defense method, and metric suite, while ensuring end-to-end reproducibility. We showcase its value by benchmarking representative defenses across varied poisoning scenarios and tasks. By standardizing data, code, and metrics, SafeTuneBed is the first focused toolkit of its kind to accelerate rigorous and comparable research in safe LLM fine-tuning. Code is available at: https://github.com/criticalml-uw/SafeTuneBed

<title>Existing Large Language Model Unlearning Evaluations Are Inconclusive</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove sensitive or undesired data from large language models. However, recent studies suggest that unlearning is often shallow, claiming that removed knowledge can easily be recovered. In this work, we critically examine standard unlearning evaluation practices and uncover key limitations that shake our trust in those findings. First, we show that some evaluations introduce substantial new information into the model, potentially masking true unlearning performance by re-teaching the model during testing. Second, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes vary significantly across tasks, undermining the generalizability of current evaluation routines. Finally, we find that many evaluations rely on spurious correlations, making their results difficult to trust and interpret. Taken together, these issues suggest that current evaluation protocols may both overstate and understate unlearning success. To address this, we propose two principles for future unlearning evaluations: minimal information injection and downstream task awareness. We validate these principles through a series of targeted experiments, showing how violations of each can lead to misleading conclusions.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant computational resources and extended training times. To address this, we build upon the foundation laid by Google Brain's Sensory Neuron, which introduced a novel neural architecture for reinforcement learning tasks that maintained permutation in-variance in the sensory neuron system. While the baseline model demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional approaches, we identified opportunities to enhance the efficiency of the learning process further. We propose a modified attention mechanism incorporating a non-linear transformation of the key vectors (K) using a mapping function, resulting in a new set of key vectors (K'). This non-linear mapping enhances the representational capacity of the attention mechanism, allowing the model to encode more complex feature interactions and accelerating convergence without compromising performance. Our enhanced model demonstrates significant improvements in learning efficiency, showcasing the potential for non-linear attention mechanisms in advancing reinforcement learning algorithms.

arXiv:2506.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In constrained Markov decision processes, enforcing constraints during training is often thought of as decreasing the final return. Recently, it was shown that constraints can be incorporated directly in the policy geometry, yielding an optimization trajectory close to the central path of a barrier method, which does not compromise final return. Building on this idea, we introduce Central Path Proximal Policy Optimization (C3PO), a simple modification of PPO that produces policy iterates, which stay close to the central path of the constrained optimization problem. Compared to existing on-policy methods, C3PO delivers improved performance with tighter constraint enforcement, suggesting that central path-guided updates offer a promising direction for constrained policy optimization.

Abstract: Determining whether a dataset was part of a machine learning model's training data pool can reveal privacy vulnerabilities, a challenge often addressed through membership inference attacks (MIAs). Traditional MIAs typically require access to model internals or rely on computationally intensive shadow models. This paper proposes an efficient, interpretable and principled Bayesian inference method for membership inference. By analyzing post-hoc metrics such as prediction error, confidence (entropy), perturbation magnitude, and dataset statistics from a trained ML model, our approach computes posterior probabilities of membership without requiring extensive model training. Experimental results on synthetic datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in distinguishing member from non-member datasets. Beyond membership inference, this method can also detect distribution shifts, offering a practical and interpretable alternative to existing approaches.

arXiv:2506.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world databases are predominantly relational, comprising multiple interlinked tables that contain complex structural and statistical dependencies. Learning generative models on relational data has shown great promise in generating synthetic data and imputing missing values. However, existing methods often struggle to capture this complexity, typically reducing relational data to conditionally generated flat tables and imposing limiting structural assumptions. To address these limitations, we introduce RelDiff, a novel diffusion generative model that synthesizes complete relational databases by explicitly modeling their foreign key graph structure. RelDiff combines a joint graph-conditioned diffusion process across all tables for attribute synthesis, and a $2K+$SBM graph generator based on the Stochastic Block Model for structure generation. The decomposition of graph structure and relational attributes ensures both high fidelity and referential integrity, both of which are crucial aspects of synthetic relational database generation. Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that RelDiff consistently outperforms prior methods in producing realistic and coherent synthetic relational databases. Code is available at https://github.com/ValterH/RelDiff.

arXiv:2506.00711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making routinely demands reasoning over heterogeneous data, yet existing multimodal language models (MLLMs) remain largely vision-centric and fail to generalize across clinical specialties. To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to forecasting tasks, with some works claiming these systems match or exceed human performance. In this paper, we argue that, as a community, we should be careful about such conclusions as evaluating LLM forecasters presents unique challenges. We identify two broad categories of issues: (1) difficulty in trusting evaluation results due to many forms of temporal leakage, and (2) difficulty in extrapolating from evaluation performance to real-world forecasting. Through systematic analysis and concrete examples from prior work, we demonstrate how evaluation flaws can raise concerns about current and future performance claims. We argue that more rigorous evaluation methodologies are needed to confidently assess the forecasting abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Multiple-shooting is a parameter estimation approach for ordinary differential equations. In this approach, the trajectory is broken into small intervals, each of which can be integrated independently. Equality constraints are then applied to eliminate the shooting gap between the end of the previous trajectory and the start of the next trajectory. Unlike single-shooting, multiple-shooting is more stable, especially for highly oscillatory and long trajectories. In the context of neural ordinary differential equations, multiple-shooting is not widely used due to the challenge of incorporating general equality constraints. In this work, we propose a condensing-based approach to incorporate these shooting equality constraints while training a multiple-shooting neural ordinary differential equation (MS-NODE) using first-order optimization methods such as Adam.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have shown robust results in plane reformatting tasks. In these methods, an agent sequentially adjusts the position and orientation of an initial plane towards an objective location. This process allows accurate plane reformatting, without the need for detailed landmarks, which makes it suitable for images with limited contrast and resolution, such as 4D flow MRI. However, current DRL methods require the test dataset to be in the same position and orientation as the training dataset. In this paper, we present a novel technique that utilizes a flexible coordinate system based on the current state, enabling navigation in volumes at any position or orientation. We adopted the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm for reinforcement learning, outperforming Deep Q Network (DQN). Experimental results in 4D flow MRI demonstrate improved accuracy in plane reformatting angular and distance errors (6.32 +- 4.15 {\deg} and 3.40 +- 2.75 mm), as well as statistically equivalent flow measurements determined by a plane reformatting process done by an expert (p=0.21). The method's flexibility and adaptability make it a promising candidate for other medical imaging applications beyond 4D flow MRI.

<title>MoPINNEnKF: Iterative Model Inference using generic-PINN-based ensemble Kalman filter</title>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical laws into the training process. However, the performance of PINNs is often hindered in real-world scenarios involving noisy observational data and missing physics, particularly in inverse problems. In this work, we propose an iterative multi-objective PINN ensemble Kalman filter (MoPINNEnKF) framework that improves the robustness and accuracy of PINNs in both forward and inverse problems by using the \textit{ensemble Kalman filter} and the \textit{non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm} III (NSGA-III). Specifically, NSGA-III is used as a multi-objective optimizer that can generate various ensemble members of PINNs along the optimal Pareto front, while accounting the model uncertainty in the solution space. These ensemble members are then utilized within the EnKF to assimilate noisy observational data. The EnKF's analysis is subsequently used to refine the data loss component for retraining the PINNs, thereby iteratively updating their parameters. The iterative procedure generates improved solutions to the PDEs. The proposed method is tested on two benchmark problems: the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion-wave equation (TFMDWE). The numerical results show it outperforms standard PINNs in handling noisy data and missing physics.

Contrary to standard linear-chain conditional random fields, BCRF allows fast parallelizable inference algorithms based on iterative Bregman projections. We show how such models can be learned using Fenchel-Young losses, including extension for learning from partial labels. Experimentally, our approach delivers comparable results to CRF while being faster, and achieves better results in highly constrained settings compared to mean field, another parallelizable alternative.

Abstract: We develop hybrid memory architectures for general-purpose sequence processing neural networks, that combine key-value memory using softmax attention (KV-memory) with dynamic synaptic memory through fast-weight programming (FW-memory) -- the core principles of quadratic and linear transformers, respectively. These two memory systems have complementary but individually limited properties: KV-memory offers precise retrieval but is constrained by quadratic complexity in sequence length, while FW-memory supports arbitrarily long sequences and enables more expressive computation but sacrifices precise recall. We propose and compare three methods to blend these two systems into a single memory system to leverage the strengths of both. We conduct experiments on general language modeling and retrieval tasks by training 340M- and 1.3B-parameter models from scratch, as well as on synthetic algorithmic tasks designed to precisely illustrate the benefits of certain hybrid methods over others. We also evaluate our hybrid memory systems on reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. Overall, we demonstrate how a well-designed hybrid can overcome the limitations of its individual components, offering new insights into the design principle of neural memory systems.

<title>"Who experiences large model decay and why?" A Hierarchical Framework for Diagnosing Heterogeneous Performance Drift</title>

arXiv:2506.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models frequently experience performance degradation when deployed in new contexts. Such degradation is rarely uniform: some subgroups may suffer large performance decay while others may not. Understanding where and how large differences in performance arise is critical for designing targeted corrective actions that mitigate decay for the most affected subgroups while minimizing any unintended effects. Current approaches do not provide such detailed insight, as they either (i) explain how average performance shifts arise or (ii) identify adversely affected subgroups without insight into how this occurred. To this end, we introduce a Subgroup-scanning Hierarchical Inference Framework for performance drifT (SHIFT). SHIFT first asks "Is there any subgroup with unacceptably large performance decay due to covariate/outcome shifts?" (Where?) and, if so, dives deeper to ask "Can we explain this using more detailed variable(subset)-specific shifts?" (How?). In real-world experiments, we find that SHIFT identifies interpretable subgroups affected by performance decay, and suggests targeted actions that effectively mitigate the decay.

This is a broad generalization of the work of Kalai and Teng, who gave an algorithm that succeeded with respect to smoothed product distributions (i.e., MRFs whose dependency graph has no edges). Our algorithm has two phases: (1) an unsupervised structure learning phase and (2) a greedy supervised learning algorithm. This is the first example where algorithms for learning the structure of an undirected graphical model lead to provably efficient algorithms for supervised learning.

<title>Beyond Attention: Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics with Emergent Interpretable Topologies</title>

arXiv:2506.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is critical in applications such as traffic prediction, energy demand modeling, and weather monitoring. While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores, introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure interpretability.
  We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline.
  Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.

<title>Manipulating 3D Molecules in a Fixed-Dimensional SE(3)-Equivariant Latent Space</title>

arXiv:2506.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medicinal chemists often optimize drugs considering their 3D structures and designing structurally distinct molecules that retain key features, such as shapes, pharmacophores, or chemical properties. Previous deep learning approaches address this through supervised tasks like molecule inpainting or property-guided optimization. In this work, we propose a flexible zero-shot molecule manipulation method by navigating in a shared latent space of 3D molecules. We introduce a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for 3D molecules, named MolFLAE, which learns a fixed-dimensional, SE(3)-equivariant latent space independent of atom counts. MolFLAE encodes 3D molecules using an SE(3)-equivariant neural network into fixed number of latent nodes, distinguished by learned embeddings. The latent space is regularized, and molecular structures are reconstructed via a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) conditioned on the encoder's latent output. MolFLAE achieves competitive performance on standard unconditional 3D molecule generation benchmarks. Moreover, the latent space of MolFLAE enables zero-shot molecule manipulation, including atom number editing, structure reconstruction, and coordinated latent interpolation for both structure and properties. We further demonstrate our approach on a drug optimization task for the human glucocorticoid receptor, generating molecules with improved hydrophilicity while preserving key interactions, under computational evaluations. These results highlight the flexibility, robustness, and real-world utility of our method, opening new avenues for molecule editing and optimization.

<title>LIFT the Veil for the Truth: Principal Weights Emerge after Rank Reduction for Reasoning-Focused Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on a small number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities. However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters, offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared to Full FT and LoRA.

Abstract: Recently, supervised learning (SL) methodology has emerged as an effective approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their simplicity, stability, and efficiency. However, recent studies show that SL methods lack the trajectory stitching capability, typically associated with temporal difference (TD)-based approaches. A question naturally surfaces: How can we endow SL methods with stitching capability and bridge its performance gap with TD learning? To answer this question, we introduce $Q$-conditioned maximization supervised learning for offline goal-conditioned RL, which enhances SL with the stitching capability through $Q$-conditioned policy and $Q$-conditioned maximization. Concretely, we propose Goal-Conditioned Reinforced Supervised Learning (GCReinSL), which consists of (1) estimating the $Q$-function by CVAE from the offline dataset and (2) finding the maximum $Q$-value within the data support by integrating $Q$-function maximization with Expectile Regression. In inference time, our policy chooses optimal actions based on such a maximum $Q$-value. Experimental results from stitching evaluations on offline RL datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior SL approaches with stitching capabilities and goal data augmentation techniques.

Abstract: Action-dependent individual policies, which incorporate both environmental states and the actions of other agents in decision-making, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving global optimality in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the existing literature often adopts auto-regressive action-dependent policies, where each agent's policy depends on the actions of all preceding agents. This formulation incurs substantial computational complexity as the number of agents increases, thereby limiting scalability. In this work, we consider a more generalized class of action-dependent policies, which do not necessarily follow the auto-regressive form. We propose to use the `action dependency graph (ADG)' to model the inter-agent action dependencies. Within the context of MARL problems structured by coordination graphs, we prove that an action-dependent policy with a sparse ADG can achieve global optimality, provided the ADG satisfies specific conditions specified by the coordination graph. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop a tabular policy iteration algorithm with guaranteed global optimality. Furthermore, we integrate our framework into several SOTA algorithms and conduct experiments in complex environments. The empirical results affirm the robustness and applicability of our approach in more general scenarios, underscoring its potential for broader MARL challenges.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal time series (STTS) have been widely used in many applications. However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models (LLMs) by constraining weight updates to low-rank matrices. Recent works such as Tied-LoRA, VeRA, and VB-LoRA push efficiency further by introducing additional constraints to reduce the trainable parameter space. In this paper, we show that the parameter space reduction strategies employed by these LoRA variants can be formulated within a unified framework, Uni-LoRA, where the LoRA parameter space, flattened as a high-dimensional vector space $R^D$, can be reconstructed through a projection from a subspace R^d, with $d \ll D$. We demonstrate that the fundamental difference among various LoRA methods lies in the choice of the projection matrix, $P \in R^{D \times d}$.Most existing LoRA variants rely on layer-wise or structure-specific projections that limit cross-layer parameter sharing, thereby compromising parameter efficiency. In light of this, we introduce an efficient and theoretically grounded projection matrix that is isometric, enabling global parameter sharing and reducing computation overhead. Furthermore, under the unified view of Uni-LoRA, this design requires only a single trainable vector to reconstruct LoRA parameters for the entire LLM - making Uni-LoRA both a unified framework and a "one-vector-only" solution. Extensive experiments on GLUE, mathematical reasoning, and instruction tuning benchmarks demonstrate that Uni-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art parameter efficiency while outperforming or matching prior approaches in predictive performance.

Abstract: Graph unlearning methods aim to efficiently remove the impact of sensitive data from trained GNNs without full retraining, assuming that deleted information cannot be recovered. In this work, we challenge this assumption by introducing the graph unlearning inversion attack: given only black-box access to an unlearned GNN and partial graph knowledge, can an adversary reconstruct the removed edges? We identify two key challenges: varying probability-similarity thresholds for unlearned versus retained edges, and the difficulty of locating unlearned edge endpoints, and address them with TrendAttack. First, we derive and exploit the confidence pitfall, a theoretical and empirical pattern showing that nodes adjacent to unlearned edges exhibit a large drop in model confidence. Second, we design an adaptive prediction mechanism that applies different similarity thresholds to unlearned and other membership edges. Our framework flexibly integrates existing membership inference techniques and extends them with trend features. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TrendAttack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN membership inference baselines, exposing a critical privacy vulnerability in current graph unlearning methods.

<title>LLM Cannot Discover Causality, and Should Be Restricted to Non-Decisional Support in Causal Discovery</title>

Abstract: This paper critically re-evaluates LLMs' role in causal discovery and argues against their direct involvement in determining causal relationships. We demonstrate that LLMs' autoregressive, correlation-driven modeling inherently lacks the theoretical grounding for causal reasoning and introduces unreliability when used as priors in causal discovery algorithms. Through empirical studies, we expose the limitations of existing LLM-based methods and reveal that deliberate prompt engineering (e.g., injecting ground-truth knowledge) could overstate their performance, helping to explain the consistently favorable results reported in much of the current literature. Based on these findings, we strictly confined LLMs' role to a non-decisional auxiliary capacity: LLMs should not participate in determining the existence or directionality of causal relationships, but can assist the search process for causal graphs (e.g., LLM-based heuristic search). Experiments across various settings confirm that, by strictly isolating LLMs from causal decision-making, LLM-guided heuristic search can accelerate the convergence and outperform both traditional and LLM-based methods in causal structure learning. We conclude with a call for the community to shift focus from naively applying LLMs to developing specialized models and training method that respect the core principles of causal discovery.

<title>Generalizable LLM Learning of Graph Synthetic Data with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate steps remains a critical challenge even after RL.

<title>Infinite-Width Limit of a Single Attention Layer: Analysis via Tensor Programs</title>

Abstract: In modern theoretical analyses of neural networks, the infinite-width limit is often invoked to justify Gaussian approximations of neuron preactivations (e.g., via neural network Gaussian processes or Tensor Programs). However, these Gaussian-based asymptotic theories have so far been unable to capture the behavior of attention layers, except under special regimes such as infinitely many heads or tailored scaling schemes. In this paper, leveraging the Tensor Programs framework, we rigorously identify the infinite-width limit distribution of variables within a single attention layer under realistic architectural dimensionality and standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-scaling with $n$ dimensionality. We derive the exact form of this limit law without resorting to infinite-head approximations or tailored scalings, demonstrating that it departs fundamentally from Gaussianity. This limiting distribution exhibits non-Gaussianity from a hierarchical structure, being Gaussian conditional on the random similarity scores. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical predictions, confirming the effectiveness of our theory at finite width and accurate description of finite-head attentions. Beyond characterizing a standalone attention layer, our findings lay the groundwork for developing a unified theory of deep Transformer architectures in the infinite-width regime.

Abstract: We introduce machine unlearning for speech tasks, a novel and underexplored research problem that aims to efficiently and effectively remove the influence of specific data from trained speech models without full retraining. This has important applications in privacy preservation, removal of outdated or noisy data, and bias mitigation. While machine unlearning has been studied in computer vision and natural language processing, its application to speech is largely unexplored due to the high-dimensional, sequential, and speaker-dependent nature of speech data. We define two fundamental speech unlearning tasks: sample unlearning, which removes individual data points (e.g., a voice recording), and class unlearning, which removes an entire category (e.g., all data from a speaker), while preserving performance on the remaining data. Experiments on keyword spotting and speaker identification demonstrate that unlearning speech data is significantly more challenging than unlearning image or text data. We conclude with key future directions in this area, including structured training, robust evaluation, feature-level unlearning, broader applications, scalable methods, and adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of Diffusion Models (DMs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), their generalization performance remains theoretically underexplored, especially lacking a full consideration of the shared encoder-generator structure. Leveraging recent information-theoretic tools, we propose a unified theoretical framework that provides guarantees for the generalization of both the encoder and generator by treating them as randomized mappings. This framework further enables (1) a refined analysis for VAEs, accounting for the generator's generalization, which was previously overlooked; (2) illustrating an explicit trade-off in generalization terms for DMs that depends on the diffusion time $T$; and (3) providing computable bounds for DMs based solely on the training data, allowing the selection of the optimal $T$ and the integration of such bounds into the optimization process to improve model performance. Empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate the validity of the proposed theory.

Abstract: Modeling complex fluid systems, especially turbulence governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), remains a fundamental challenge in science and engineering. Recently, diffusion-based generative models have gained attention as a powerful approach for these tasks, owing to their capacity to capture long-range dependencies and recover hierarchical structures. However, we present both empirical and theoretical evidence showing that generative models struggle with significant spectral bias and common-mode noise when generating high-fidelity turbulent flows. Here we propose FourierFlow, a novel generative turbulence modeling framework that enhances the frequency-aware learning by both implicitly and explicitly mitigating spectral bias and common-mode noise. FourierFlow comprises three key innovations. Firstly, we adopt a dual-branch backbone architecture, consisting of a salient flow attention branch with local-global awareness to focus on sensitive turbulence areas. Secondly, we introduce a frequency-guided Fourier mixing branch, which is integrated via an adaptive fusion strategy to explicitly mitigate spectral bias in the generative model. Thirdly, we leverage the high-frequency modeling capabilities of the masked auto-encoder pre-training and implicitly align the features of the generative model toward high-frequency components. We validate the effectiveness of FourierFlow on three canonical turbulent flow scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that our model exhibits strong generalization capabilities in challenging settings such as out-of-distribution domains, long-term temporal extrapolation, and robustness to noisy inputs. The code can be found at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/FourierFlow.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative modeling have demonstrated significant promise in tackling long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks by leveraging offline datasets. While these approaches have achieved promising results, their reliability remains inconsistent due to the inherent stochastic risk of producing infeasible trajectories, limiting their applicability in safety-critical applications. We identify that the primary cause of these failures is inaccurate guidance during the sampling procedure, and demonstrate the existence of manifold deviation by deriving a lower bound on the guidance gap. To address this challenge, we propose Local Manifold Approximation and Projection (LoMAP), a training-free method that projects the guided sample onto a low-rank subspace approximated from offline datasets, preventing infeasible trajectory generation. We validate our approach on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks that involve challenging long-horizon planning. Furthermore, we show that, as a standalone module, LoMAP can be incorporated into the hierarchical diffusion planner, providing further performance enhancements.

Abstract: Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) aims to understand interactions between molecular pairs, playing a critical role in advancing biochemical research. With the recent development of large language models (LLMs), a growing number of studies have explored the integration of MRL with LLMs and achieved promising results. However, the increasing availability of diverse LLMs and molecular structure encoders has significantly expanded the model space, presenting major challenges for benchmarking. Currently, there is no LLM framework that supports both flexible molecular input formats and dynamic architectural switching. To address these challenges, reduce redundant coding, and ensure fair model comparison, we propose ModuLM, a framework designed to support flexible LLM-based model construction and diverse molecular representations. ModuLM provides a rich suite of modular components, including 8 types of 2D molecular graph encoders, 11 types of 3D molecular conformation encoders, 7 types of interaction layers, and 7 mainstream LLM backbones. Owing to its highly flexible model assembly mechanism, ModuLM enables the dynamic construction of over 50,000 distinct model configurations. In addition, we provide comprehensive results to demonstrate the effectiveness of ModuLM in supporting LLM-based MRL tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.

<title>PCoreSet: Effective Active Learning through Knowledge Distillation from Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used framework for training compact, task-specific models by leveraging the knowledge of teacher models. However, its application to active learning (AL), which aims to minimize annotation costs through iterative sample selection, remains underexplored. This gap stems from the fact that KD typically assumes access to sufficient labeled data, whereas AL operates in data-scarce scenarios where task-specific teacher models are often unavailable. In this paper, we introduce ActiveKD, a framework that integrates AL with KD by leveraging the zero- and few-shot capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs). A key aspect of ActiveKD is the structured prediction bias of VLMs--i.e., their predictions form clusters in the probability space. We regard this structure as an inductive bias of the teacher model, capturing generalizable output patterns beneficial to student learning. To exploit this bias, we propose Probabilistic CoreSet (PCoreSet), a selection strategy that maximizes coverage in the probability space rather than the feature space. PCoreSet strategically selects categorically diverse unlabeled samples, facilitating more efficient transfer of teacher knowledge under limited annotation budgets. Evaluations on 11 datasets show that PCoreSet consistently outperforms existing selection methods within the ActiveKD framework, advancing research at the intersection of AL and KD.

Abstract: Bayesian posterior sampling techniques have demonstrated superior empirical performance in many exploration-exploitation settings. However, their theoretical analysis remains a challenge, especially in complex settings like reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce Q-Learning with Posterior Sampling (PSQL), a simple Q-learning-based algorithm that uses Gaussian posteriors on Q-values for exploration, akin to the popular Thompson Sampling algorithm in the multi-armed bandit setting. We show that in the tabular episodic MDP setting, PSQL achieves a regret bound of $\tilde O(H^2\sqrt{SAT})$, closely matching the known lower bound of $\Omega(H\sqrt{SAT})$. Here, S, A denote the number of states and actions in the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), and $T=KH$ with $K$ being the number of episodes and $H$ being the planning horizon. Our work provides several new technical insights into the core challenges in combining posterior sampling with dynamic programming and TD-learning-based RL algorithms, along with novel ideas for resolving those difficulties. We hope this will form a starting point for analyzing this efficient and important algorithmic technique in even more complex RL settings.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical in safety-sensitive applications but is often omitted from off-the-shelf neural networks due to adverse effects on predictive performance. Retrofitting uncertainty estimates post-hoc typically requires access to model parameters or gradients, limiting feasibility in practice. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for post-hoc uncertainty estimation in regression tasks by fitting an auxiliary model to both original inputs and frozen model outputs. Drawing from principles of maximum likelihood estimation and sequential parameter fitting, we formalize an exact post-hoc optimization objective that recovers the canonical MLE of Gaussian parameters, without requiring sampling or approximation at inference. While prior work has used model outputs to estimate uncertainty, we explicitly characterize the conditions under which this is valid and demonstrate the extent to which structured outputs can support quasi-epistemic inference. We find that using diverse auxiliary data, such as augmented subsets of the original training data, significantly enhances OOD detection and metric performance. Our hypothesis that frozen model outputs contain generalizable latent information about model error and predictive uncertainty is tested and confirmed. Finally, we ensure that our method maintains proper estimation of input-dependent uncertainty without relying exclusively on base model forecasts. These findings are demonstrated in toy problems and adapted to both UCI and depth regression benchmarks. Code: https://github.com/biggzlar/IO-CUE.

Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition, multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy, leveraging aggregated updates to build robust global models. However, this training paradigm faces significant challenges due to data heterogeneity and limited local datasets, which often impede effective collaboration. In such scenarios, we identify the Layer-wise Inertia Phenomenon in FL, wherein the middle layers of global model undergo minimal updates after early communication rounds, ultimately limiting the effectiveness of global aggregation. We demonstrate the presence of this phenomenon across a wide range of federated settings, spanning diverse datasets and architectures. To address this issue, we propose LIPS (Layer-wise Inertia Phenomenon with Sparsity), a simple yet effective method that periodically introduces transient sparsity to stimulate meaningful updates and empower global aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that LIPS effectively mitigates layer-wise inertia, enhances aggregation effectiveness, and improves overall performance in various FL scenarios. This work not only deepens the understanding of layer-wise learning dynamics in FL but also paves the way for more effective collaboration strategies in resource-constrained environments. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/QiaoXiao7282/LIPS.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular metabolic stability (MS) is critical for drug research and development but remains challenging due to the complex interplay of molecular interactions. Despite recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) for MS prediction, current approaches face two critical limitations: (1) incomplete molecular modeling due to atom-centric message-passing mechanisms that disregard bond-level topological features, and (2) prediction frameworks that lack reliable uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose TrustworthyMS, a novel contrastive learning framework designed for uncertainty-aware metabolic stability prediction. First, a molecular graph topology remapping mechanism synchronizes atom-bond interactions through edge-induced feature propagation, capturing both localized electronic effects and global conformational constraints. Second, contrastive topology-bond alignment enforces consistency between molecular topology views and bond patterns via feature alignment, enhancing representation robustness. Third, uncertainty modeling through Beta-Binomial uncertainty quantification enables simultaneous prediction and confidence calibration under epistemic uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate that TrustworthyMS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance.

Abstract: Marketing optimization, commonly formulated as an online budget allocation problem, has emerged as a pivotal factor in driving user growth. Most existing research addresses this problem by following the principle of 'first predict then optimize' for each individual, which presents challenges related to large-scale counterfactual prediction and solving complexity trade-offs. Note that the practical data quality is uncontrollable, and the solving scale tends to be tens of millions. Therefore, the existing approaches make the robust budget allocation non-trivial, especially in industrial scenarios with considerable data noise. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach that solves the problem from the cluster perspective. Specifically, we propose a multi-task representation network to learn the inherent attributes of individuals and project the original features into high-dimension hidden representations through the first two layers of the trained network. Then, we divide these hidden representations into $K$ groups through partitioning-based clustering, thus reformulating the problem as an integer stochastic programming problem under different total budgets. Finally, we distill the representation module and clustering model into a multi-category model to facilitate online deployment. Offline experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to six state-of-the-art marketing optimization algorithms. Online A/B tests on the Meituan platform indicate that the approach outperforms the online algorithm by 0.53% and 0.65%, considering order volume (OV) and gross merchandise volume (GMV), respectively.

Abstract: Decentralized learning has emerged as a powerful approach for handling large datasets across multiple machines in a communication-efficient manner. However, such methods often face scalability limitations, as increasing the number of machines beyond a certain point negatively impacts convergence rates. In this work, we propose Decentralized Anytime SGD, a novel decentralized learning algorithm that significantly extends the critical parallelism threshold, enabling the effective use of more machines without compromising performance. Within the stochastic convex optimization (SCO) framework, we establish a theoretical upper bound on parallelism that surpasses the current state-of-the-art, allowing larger networks to achieve favorable statistical guarantees and closing the gap with centralized learning in highly connected topologies.

Abstract: We extend the standard reinforcement learning framework to random time horizons. While the classical setting typically assumes finite and deterministic or infinite runtimes of trajectories, we argue that multiple real-world applications naturally exhibit random (potentially trajectory-dependent) stopping times. Since those stopping times typically depend on the policy, their randomness has an effect on policy gradient formulas, which we (mostly for the first time) derive rigorously in this work both for stochastic and deterministic policies. We present two complementary perspectives, trajectory or state-space based, and establish connections to optimal control theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that using the proposed formulas can significantly improve optimization convergence compared to traditional approaches.

<title>Pilot Contamination-Aware Graph Attention Network for Power Control in CFmMIMO</title>

Abstract: Optimization-based power control algorithms are predominantly iterative with high computational complexity, making them impractical for real-time applications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of machine learning (ML) systems. Traditional algorithms, which are typically designed to optimize average performance, often overlook the intrinsic diversity within datasets. This oversight can lead to a myriad of issues, including unreliable decision-making, inadequate generalization across different domains, unfair outcomes, and false scientific inferences. Hence, a nuanced approach to modeling data heterogeneity is essential for the development of dependable, data-driven systems. In this survey paper, we present a thorough exploration of heterogeneity-aware machine learning, a paradigm that systematically integrates considerations of data heterogeneity throughout the entire ML pipeline -- from data collection and model training to model evaluation and deployment. By applying this approach to a variety of critical fields, including healthcare, agriculture, finance, and recommendation systems, we demonstrate the substantial benefits and potential of heterogeneity-aware ML. These applications underscore how a deeper understanding of data diversity can enhance model robustness, fairness, and reliability and help model diagnosis and improvements. Moreover, we delve into future directions and provide research opportunities for the whole data mining community, aiming to promote the development of heterogeneity-aware ML.

<title>Quantization-based Bounds on the Wasserstein Metric</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The Wasserstein metric has become increasingly important in many machine learning applications such as generative modeling, image retrieval and domain adaptation. Despite its appeal, it is often too costly to compute. This has motivated approximation methods like entropy-regularized optimal transport, downsampling, and subsampling, which trade accuracy for computational efficiency. In this paper, we consider the challenge of computing efficient approximations to the Wasserstein metric that also serve as strict upper or lower bounds. Focusing on discrete measures on regular grids, our approach involves formulating and exactly solving a Kantorovich problem on a coarse grid using a quantized measure and specially designed cost matrix, followed by an upscaling and correction stage. This is done either in the primal or dual space to obtain valid upper and lower bounds on the Wasserstein metric of the full-resolution inputs. We evaluate our methods on the DOTmark optimal transport images benchmark, demonstrating a 10x-100x speedup compared to entropy-regularized OT while keeping the approximation error below 2%.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) improves performance on domain-specific tasks but can lead to overfitting, making them unreliable on out-of-distribution (OoD) queries. We propose LoRA-BAM - a method that adds OoD detection monitors to the LoRA layer using boxed abstraction to filter questions beyond the model's competence. Feature vectors from the fine-tuning data are extracted via the LLM and clustered. Clusters are enclosed in boxes; a question is flagged as OoD if its feature vector falls outside all boxes. To improve interpretability and robustness, we introduce a regularization loss during fine-tuning that encourages paraphrased questions to stay close in the feature space, and the enlargement of the decision boundary is based on the feature variance within a cluster. Our method complements existing defenses by providing lightweight and interpretable OoD detection.

<title>Understanding Model Reprogramming for CLIP via Decoupling Visual Prompts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model reprogramming adapts pretrained models to downstream tasks by modifying only the input and output spaces. Visual reprogramming (VR) is one instance for vision tasks that adds a trainable noise pattern (i.e., a visual prompt) to input images to facilitate downstream classification. The existing VR approaches for CLIP train a single visual prompt using all descriptions of different downstream classes. However, the limited learning capacity may result in (1) a failure to capture diverse aspects of the descriptions (e.g., shape, color, and texture), and (2) a possible bias toward less informative attributes that do not help distinguish between classes. In this paper, we introduce a decoupling-and-reweighting framework. Our decoupled visual prompts (DVP) are optimized using descriptions grouped by explicit causes (DVP-cse) or unsupervised clusters (DVP-cls). Then, we integrate the outputs of these visual prompts with a probabilistic reweighting matrix (PRM) that measures their contributions to each downstream class. Theoretically, DVP lowers the empirical risk bound. Experimentally, DVP outperforms baselines on average across 11 downstream datasets. Notably, the DVP-PRM integration enables insights into how individual visual prompts influence classification decisions, providing a probabilistic framework for understanding reprogramming. Our code is available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/DecoupledVP.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods have been central to many of the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning. The most common approach is to use symmetric architectures, whereby both actor and critic have the same network topology and number of parameters. However, recent works have argued for the advantages of asymmetric setups, specifically with the use of smaller actors. We perform broad empirical investigations and analyses to better understand the implications of this and find that, in general, smaller actors result in performance degradation and overfit critics. Our analyses suggest poor data collection, due to value underestimation, as one of the main causes for this behavior, and further highlight the crucial role the critic can play in alleviating this pathology. We explore techniques to mitigate the observed value underestimation, which enables further research in asymmetric actor-critic methods.

<title>Taming LLMs by Scaling Learning Rates with Gradient Grouping</title>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses challenges due to their massive scale and heterogeneous architectures. While adaptive optimizers like AdamW help address gradient variations, they still struggle with efficient and effective parameter-wise learning rate estimation, resulting in training instability, slow convergence, and poor compatibility with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This work introduces Scaling with Gradient Grouping (SGG), an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate estimation by dynamic grouping and group-specific scaling. SGG first groups gradient statistics in each layer into clusters and then applies cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for each parameter, thus imposing collective group-wise constraints while maintaining precise per-parameter adaptation. Experiments on diverse (M)LLM benchmarks show that SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers, and offers consistent gains and faster convergence over baselines, with various model sizes. Its stability across varying batch sizes and learning rates establishes SGG as a robust choice for LLM optimization.

<title>A Finite-Time Analysis of TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation without Projections nor Strong Convexity</title>

arXiv:2506.01052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time convergence properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, a cornerstone algorithm in reinforcement learning. While prior work has established convergence guarantees, these results typically rely on the assumption that each iterate is projected onto a bounded set or that the learning rate is set according to the unknown strong convexity constant -- conditions that are both artificial and do not match the current practice.
  In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such assumptions and present a refined analysis of TD learning. We show that the simple projection-free variant converges with a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{||\theta^*||^2_2}{\sqrt{T}})$, even in the presence of Markovian noise. Our analysis reveals a novel self-bounding property of the TD updates and exploits it to guarantee bounded iterates.

<title>No Soundness in the Real World: On the Challenges of the Verification of Deployed Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: The ultimate goal of verification is to guarantee the safety of deployed neural networks. Here, we claim that all the state-of-the-art verifiers we are aware of fail to reach this goal. Our key insight is that theoretical soundness (bounding the full-precision output while computing with floating point) does not imply practical soundness (bounding the floating point output in a potentially stochastic environment). We prove this observation for the approaches that are currently used to achieve provable theoretical soundness, such as interval analysis and its variants. We also argue that achieving practical soundness is significantly harder computationally. We support our claims empirically as well by evaluating several well-known verification methods. To mislead the verifiers, we create adversarial networks that detect and exploit features of the deployment environment, such as the order and precision of floating point operations. We demonstrate that all the tested verifiers are vulnerable to our new deployment-specific attacks, which proves that they are not practically sound.

Abstract: Feature attribution (FA) methods are widely used in explainable AI (XAI) to help users understand how the inputs of a machine learning model contribute to its outputs. However, different FA models often provide disagreeing importance scores for the same model. In the absence of ground truth or in-depth knowledge about the inner workings of the model, it is often difficult to meaningfully determine which of the different FA methods produce more suitable explanations in different contexts. As a step towards addressing this issue, we introduce the open-source XAI-Units benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate FA methods against diverse types of model behaviours, such as feature interactions, cancellations, and discontinuous outputs. Our benchmark provides a set of paired datasets and models with known internal mechanisms, establishing clear expectations for desirable attribution scores. Accompanied by a suite of built-in evaluation metrics, XAI-Units streamlines systematic experimentation and reveals how FA methods perform against distinct, atomic kinds of model reasoning, similar to unit tests in software engineering. Crucially, by using procedurally generated models tied to synthetic datasets, we pave the way towards an objective and reliable comparison of FA methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Uncertainty Estimation (UE) methods have become a crucial tool for detecting hallucinations in recent years. While numerous UE methods have been proposed, most existing studies evaluate them in isolated short-form QA settings using threshold-independent metrics such as AUROC or PRR. However, real-world deployment of UE methods introduces several challenges. In this work, we systematically examine four key aspects of deploying UE methods in practical settings. Specifically, we assess (1) the sensitivity of UE methods to decision threshold selection, (2) their robustness to query transformations such as typos, adversarial prompts, and prior chat history, (3) their applicability to long-form generation, and (4) strategies for handling multiple UE scores for a single query. Our evaluations on 19 UE methods reveal that most of them are highly sensitive to threshold selection when there is a distribution shift in the calibration dataset. While these methods generally exhibit robustness against previous chat history and typos, they are significantly vulnerable to adversarial prompts. Additionally, while existing UE methods can be adapted for long-form generation through various strategies, there remains considerable room for improvement. Lastly, ensembling multiple UE scores at test time provides a notable performance boost, which highlights its potential as a practical improvement strategy.

<title>Attention Retrieves, MLP Memorizes: Disentangling Trainable Components in the Transformer</title>

Abstract: The Transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide range of algorithmic tasks -- including mathematical reasoning, memorization, and retrieval -- using only gradient-based training on next-token prediction. While the core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard Transformers to variants in which either the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers or the attention projectors (queries and keys) are frozen at initialization. To further isolate the contribution of attention, we introduce MixiT -- the Mixing Transformer -- a simplified, principled model in which the attention coefficients are entirely random and fixed at initialization, eliminating any input-dependent computation or learning in attention. Surprisingly, we find that MixiT matches the performance of fully trained Transformers on various algorithmic tasks, especially those involving basic arithmetic or focusing heavily on memorization. For retrieval-based tasks, we observe that having input-dependent attention coefficients is consistently beneficial, while MixiT underperforms. We attribute this failure to its inability to form specialized circuits such as induction heads -- a specific circuit known to be crucial for learning and exploiting repeating patterns in input sequences. Even more interestingly, we find that attention with frozen key and query projectors is not only able to form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling. Our results underscore the importance of architectural heterogeneity, where distinct components contribute complementary inductive biases crucial for solving different classes of tasks.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of diffusion models, their integration into safety-critical or scientifically rigorous applications remains hindered by the need to ensure compliance with stringent physical, structural, and operational constraints. To address this challenge, this paper introduces Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves diffusion steps with symbolic optimization, enabling the generation of certifiably consistent samples under user-defined functional and logic constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard and discrete diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular structures and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This ability is demonstrated on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in the context of non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory optimization; (2) Data scarcity, in domains such as drug discovery and materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain generalization, where enforcing symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the training distribution.

Abstract: Slow Feature Analysis is a unsupervised representation learning method that extracts slowly varying features from temporal data and can be used as a basis for subsequent reinforcement learning. Often, the behavior that generates the data on which the representation is learned is assumed to be a uniform random walk. Less research has focused on using samples generated by goal-directed behavior, as commonly the case in a reinforcement learning setting, to learn a representation. In a spatial setting, goal-directed behavior typically leads to significant differences in state occupancy between states that are close to a reward location and far from a reward location.
  Through the perspective of optimal slow features on ergodic Markov chains, this work investigates the effects of these differences on value-function approximation in an idealized setting. Furthermore, three correction routes, which can potentially alleviate detrimental scaling effects, are evaluated and discussed. In addition, the special case of goal-averse behavior is considered.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring their outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains challenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language (DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible approach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically building a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the validity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which often incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel $\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that identifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time, significantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This further enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a large number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding engine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through comprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON generation, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that Formatron not only $\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant outputs but also achieves $\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference speed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly, Formatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release Formatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.

Abstract: We introduce WARP (Weight-space Adaptive Recurrent Prediction), a simple yet powerful framework that unifies weight-space learning with linear recurrence to redefine sequence modeling. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states, WARP explicitly parametrizes the hidden state as the weights of a distinct root neural network. This formulation promotes higher-resolution memory, gradient-free adaptation at test-time, and seamless integration of domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks, spanning synthetic benchmarks to real-world datasets. Furthermore, extensive experiments across sequential image completion, dynamical system reconstruction, and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate its expressiveness and generalization capabilities. Critically, WARP's weight trajectories offer valuable insights into the model's inner workings. Ablation studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine intelligence.

Abstract: Simulation-free training frameworks have been at the forefront of the generative modelling revolution in continuous spaces, leading to neural dynamical systems that encompass modern large-scale diffusion and flow matching models. Despite the scalability of training, the generation of high-quality samples and their corresponding likelihood under the model requires expensive numerical simulation -- inhibiting adoption in numerous scientific applications such as equilibrium sampling of molecular systems. In this paper, we revisit classical normalizing flows as one-step generative models with exact likelihoods and propose a novel, scalable training objective that does not require computing the expensive change of variable formula used in conventional maximum likelihood training. We propose Forward-Only Regression Training (FORT), a simple $\ell_2$-regression objective that maps prior samples under our flow to specifically chosen targets. We demonstrate that FORT supports a wide class of targets, such as optimal transport targets and targets from pre-trained continuous-time normalizing flows (CNF). We further demonstrate that by using CNF targets, our one-step flows allow for larger-scale training that exceeds the performance and stability of maximum likelihood training, while unlocking a broader class of architectures that were previously challenging to train. Empirically, we elucidate that our trained flows can perform equilibrium conformation sampling in Cartesian coordinates of alanine dipeptide, alanine tripeptide, and alanine tetrapeptide.

Abstract: To ensure learned controllers comply with safety and reliability requirements for reinforcement learning in real-world settings remains challenging. Traditional safety assurance approaches, such as state avoidance and constrained Markov decision processes, often inadequately capture trajectory requirements or may result in overly conservative behaviors. To address these limitations, recent studies advocate the use of formal specification languages such as linear temporal logic (LTL), enabling the derivation of correct-by-construction learning objectives from the specified requirements. However, the sparse rewards associated with LTL specifications make learning extremely difficult, whereas dense heuristic-based rewards risk compromising correctness. In this work, we propose the first method, to our knowledge, that integrates LTL with differentiable simulators, facilitating efficient gradient-based learning directly from LTL specifications by coupling with differentiable paradigms. Our approach introduces soft labeling to achieve differentiable rewards and states, effectively mitigating the sparse-reward issue intrinsic to LTL without compromising objective correctness. We validate the efficacy of our method through experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in both reward attainment and training time compared to the discrete methods.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning offers a path to leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for drug discovery, but optimal model architectures remain unclear. We systematically optimize the quantum-classical bridge architecture for generative adversarial networks (GANs) in molecular discovery using multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Our optimized model (BO-QGAN) significantly improves performance, achieving a 2.27-fold higher Drug Candidate Score (DCS) than prior quantum-hybrid benchmarks and 2.21-fold higher than the classical baseline, using over 60% fewer parameters. Key findings favor layering multiple (3-4) shallow (4-8 qubit) quantum circuits sequentially, while classical architecture shows less sensitivity above a minimum capacity. This work provides the first empirically grounded architectural guidelines for hybrid models, enabling more effective integration of current quantum computers into pharmaceutical research pipelines.

Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models with human preferences. While RLHF has demonstrated promising results, many algorithms are highly sensitive to misspecifications in the underlying preference model (e.g., the Bradley-Terry model), the reference policy, or the reward function, resulting in undesirable fine-tuning. To address model misspecification, we propose a doubly robust preference optimization algorithm that remains consistent when either the preference model or the reference policy is correctly specified (without requiring both). Our proposal demonstrates superior and more robust performance than state-of-the-art algorithms, both in theory and in practice. The code is available at https://github.com/DRPO4LLM/DRPO4LLM

<title>FedRPCA: Enhancing Federated LoRA Aggregation Using Robust PCA</title>

Abstract: LoRA has emerged as one of the most promising fine-tuning techniques, especially for federated learning (FL), since it significantly reduces communication and computation costs at resource-constrained clients. However, data heterogeneity remains a significant challenge for LoRA-based FL, and the conventional aggregation strategy based on FedAvg suffers from slow convergence and suboptimal accuracy. Motivated by recent advances in model merging, particularly Task Arithmetic, we explore the idea of aggregating client LoRA parameters using scaled averaging. We first observe that a naive application of Task Arithmetic is ineffective due to the high cosine similarity between client updates, indicating significant common knowledge in the updates across clients. To address this issue, we propose decomposing client LoRA updates via Robust Principal Component Analysis (Robust-PCA) into a common low-rank component and client-specific sparse components. Our proposed algorithm FedRPCA aggregates the low-rank components through averaging, consolidating common knowledge, and applies scaled averaging to the sparse components to amplify client-specific knowledge. We evaluate our approach across a variety of vision and language tasks and demonstrate that it achieves higher final accuracy and faster convergence compared to competing baselines.

<title>Multiresolution Analysis and Statistical Thresholding on Dynamic Networks</title>

Abstract: Detecting structural change in dynamic network data has wide-ranging applications. Existing approaches typically divide the data into time bins, extract network features within each bin, and then compare these features over time. This introduces an inherent tradeoff between temporal resolution and the statistical stability of the extracted features. Despite this tradeoff, reminiscent of time-frequency tradeoffs in signal processing, most methods rely on a fixed temporal resolution. Choosing an appropriate resolution parameter is typically difficult and can be especially problematic in domains like cybersecurity, where anomalous behavior may emerge at multiple time scales. We address this challenge by proposing ANIE (Adaptive Network Intensity Estimation), a multi-resolution framework designed to automatically identify the time scales at which network structure evolves, enabling the joint detection of both rapid and gradual changes. Modeling interactions as Poisson processes, our method proceeds in two steps: (1) estimating a low-dimensional subspace of node behavior, and (2) deriving a set of novel empirical affinity coefficients that quantify change in interaction intensity between latent factors and support statistical testing for structural change across time scales. We provide theoretical guarantees for subspace estimation and the asymptotic behavior of the affinity coefficients, enabling model-based change detection. Experiments on synthetic networks show that ANIE adapts to the appropriate time resolution and is able to capture sharp structural changes while remaining robust to noise. Furthermore, applications to real-world data showcase the practical benefits of ANIE's multiresolution approach to detecting structural change over fixed resolution methods.

<title>Dynamic Modes as Time Representation for Spatiotemporal Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven time embedding method for modeling long-range seasonal dependencies in spatiotemporal forecasting tasks. The proposed approach employs Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to extract temporal modes directly from observed data, eliminating the need for explicit timestamps or hand-crafted time features. These temporal modes serve as time representations that can be seamlessly integrated into deep spatiotemporal forecasting models. Unlike conventional embeddings such as time-of-day indicators or sinusoidal functions, our method captures complex multi-scale periodicity through spectral analysis of spatiotemporal data. Extensive experiments on urban mobility, highway traffic, and climate datasets demonstrate that the DMD-based embedding consistently improves long-horizon forecasting accuracy, reduces residual correlation, and enhances temporal generalization. The method is lightweight, model-agnostic, and compatible with any architecture that incorporates time covariates.

<title>On the Stability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks: A Probabilistic Perspective</title>

Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis.

<title>Self-Refining Training for Amortized Density Functional Theory</title>

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) allows for predicting all the chemical and physical properties of molecular systems from first principles by finding an approximate solution to the many-body Schr\"odinger equation. However, the cost of these predictions becomes infeasible when increasing the scale of the energy evaluations, e.g., when calculating the ground-state energy for simulating molecular dynamics. Recent works have demonstrated that, for substantially large datasets of molecular conformations, Deep Learning-based models can predict the outputs of the classical DFT solvers by amortizing the corresponding optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel method that reduces the dependency of amortized DFT solvers on large pre-collected datasets by introducing a self-refining training strategy. Namely, we propose an efficient method that simultaneously trains a deep-learning model to predict the DFT outputs and samples molecular conformations that are used as training data for the model. We derive our method as a minimization of the variational upper bound on the KL-divergence measuring the discrepancy between the generated samples and the target Boltzmann distribution defined by the ground state energy. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed scheme, we perform an extensive empirical study comparing it with the models trained on the pre-collected datasets. Finally, we open-source our implementation of the proposed algorithm, optimized with asynchronous training and sampling stages, which enables simultaneous sampling and training. Code is available at https://github.com/majhas/self-refining-dft.

<title>Stress-Testing ML Pipelines with Adversarial Data Corruption</title>

arXiv:2506.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured data-quality issues, such as missing values correlated with demographics, culturally biased labels, or systemic selection biases, routinely degrade the reliability of machine-learning pipelines. Regulators now increasingly demand evidence that high-stakes systems can withstand these realistic, interdependent errors, yet current robustness evaluations typically use random or overly simplistic corruptions, leaving worst-case scenarios unexplored. We introduce SAVAGE, a causally inspired framework that (i) formally models realistic data-quality issues through dependency graphs and flexible corruption templates, and (ii) systematically discovers corruption patterns that maximally degrade a target performance metric. SAVAGE employs a bi-level optimization approach to efficiently identify vulnerable data subpopulations and fine-tune corruption severity, treating the full ML pipeline, including preprocessing and potentially non-differentiable models, as a black box. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and ML tasks (data cleaning, fairness-aware learning, uncertainty quantification) demonstrate that even a small fraction (around 5 %) of structured corruptions identified by SAVAGE severely impacts model performance, far exceeding random or manually crafted errors, and invalidating core assumptions of existing techniques. Thus, SAVAGE provides a practical tool for rigorous pipeline stress-testing, a benchmark for evaluating robustness methods, and actionable guidance for designing more resilient data workflows.

<title>Towards Efficient Few-shot Graph Neural Architecture Search via Partitioning Gradient Contribution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the contextual dueling bandit problem by proposing variance-aware algorithms that leverage neural networks to approximate nonlinear utility functions. Our approach employs a \textit{variance-aware exploration strategy}, which adaptively accounts for uncertainty in pairwise comparisons while relying only on the gradients with respect to the learnable parameters of the last layer. This design effectively balances the exploration--exploitation tradeoff under both the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling (TS) frameworks. As a result, under standard assumptions, we establish theoretical guarantees showing that our algorithms achieve sublinear cumulative average regret of order $\bigol\lt(d \sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2} + \sqrt{dT}\rt),$ for sufficiently wide neural networks, where $ d $ is the contextual dimension, $ \sigma_t^2 $ the variance of comparisons at round $ t $, and $ T $ the total number of rounds. We also empirically validate that our approach offers reasonable computational efficiency and achieves sublinear regret on both synthetic tasks with nonlinear utilities and real-world tasks, outperforming existing methods.

<title>Protocol Models: Scaling Decentralized Training with Communication-Efficient Model Parallelism</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Scaling models has led to significant advancements in deep learning, but training these models in decentralized settings remains challenging due to communication bottlenecks. While existing compression techniques are effective in data-parallel, they do not extend to model parallelism. Unlike data-parallel training, where weight gradients are exchanged, model-parallel requires compressing activations and activation gradients as they propagate through layers, accumulating compression errors. We propose a novel compression algorithm that compresses both forward and backward passes, enabling up to 99% compression with no convergence degradation with negligible memory/compute overhead. By leveraging a recursive structure in transformer networks, we predefine a low-dimensional subspace to confine the activations and gradients, allowing full reconstruction in subsequent layers. Our method achieves up to 100x improvement in communication efficiency and enables training billion-parameter-scale models over low-end GPUs connected via consumer-grade internet speeds as low as 80Mbps, matching the convergence of centralized datacenter systems with 100Gbps connections with model parallel.

<title>The Actor-Critic Update Order Matters for PPO in Federated Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), applying Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) faces challenges related to the update order of its actor and critic due to the aggregation step occurring between successive iterations. In particular, when local actors are updated based on local critic estimations, the algorithm becomes vulnerable to data heterogeneity. As a result, the conventional update order in PPO (critic first, then actor) may cause heterogeneous gradient directions among clients, hindering convergence to a globally optimal policy. To address this issue, we propose FedRAC, which reverses the update order (actor first, then critic) to eliminate the divergence of critics from different clients. Theoretical analysis shows that the convergence bound of FedRAC is immune to data heterogeneity under mild conditions, i.e., bounded level of heterogeneity and accurate policy evaluation. Empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains higher cumulative rewards and converges more rapidly in five experiments, including three classical RL environments and a highly heterogeneous autonomous driving scenario using the SUMO traffic simulator.

<title>TSRating: Rating Quality of Diverse Time Series Data by Meta-learning from LLM Judgment</title>

Abstract: High-quality time series (TS) data are essential for ensuring TS model performance, rendering research on rating TS data quality indispensable. Existing methods have shown promising rating accuracy within individual domains, primarily by extending data quality rating techniques such as influence functions and Shapley values to account for temporal characteristics. However, they neglect the fact that real-world TS data can span vastly different domains and exhibit distinct properties, hampering the accurate and efficient rating of diverse TS data. In this paper, we propose TSRating, a novel and unified framework for rating the quality of time series data crawled from diverse domains. TSRating is built on the assumption that LLMs inherit ample knowledge, acquired during their extensive pretraining, enabling them to comprehend and discern quality differences in diverse TS data. We verify this assumption by devising a series of prompts to elicit quality comparisons from LLMs for pairs of TS samples. We then fit a dedicated rating model, termed TSRater, to convert the LLMs' judgments into efficient quality predictions via TSRater's inference on future TS samples. To ensure cross-domain adaptability, we develop a meta-learning scheme to train TSRater on quality comparisons collected from nine distinct domains. To improve training efficiency, we employ signSGD for inner-loop updates, thus circumventing the demanding computation of hypergradients. Extensive experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets across three time series tasks, each using both conventional TS models and TS foundation models, demonstrate that TSRating outperforms baselines in terms of estimation accuracy, efficiency, and domain adaptability.

Abstract: Episodic memory enables humans to recall past experiences by associating semantic elements such as objects, locations, and time into coherent event representations. While large pretrained models have shown remarkable progress in modeling semantic memory, the mechanisms for forming associative structures that support episodic memory remain underexplored. Inspired by hippocampal CA3 dynamics and its role in associative memory, we propose the Latent Structured Hopfield Network (LSHN), a biologically inspired framework that integrates continuous Hopfield attractor dynamics into an autoencoder architecture. LSHN mimics the cortical-hippocampal pathway: a semantic encoder extracts compact latent representations, a latent Hopfield network performs associative refinement through attractor convergence, and a decoder reconstructs perceptual input. Unlike traditional Hopfield networks, our model is trained end-to-end with gradient descent, achieving scalable and robust memory retrieval. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a simulated episodic memory task demonstrate superior performance in recalling corrupted inputs under occlusion and noise, outperforming existing associative memory models. Our work provides a computational perspective on how semantic elements can be dynamically bound into episodic memory traces through biologically grounded attractor mechanisms.

arXiv:2506.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly complex neural network architectures have achieved phenomenal performance. However, these complex models require massive computational resources that consume substantial amounts of electricity, which highlights the potential environmental impact of such models. Previous studies have demonstrated that substantial redundancies exist in large pre-trained models. However, previous work has primarily focused on compressing models while retaining comparable model performance, and the direct impact on electricity consumption appears to have received relatively little attention. By quantifying the energy usage associated with both uncompressed and compressed models, we investigate compression as a means of reducing electricity consumption. We consider nine different pre-trained models, ranging in size from 8M parameters to 138M parameters. To establish a baseline, we first train each model without compression and record the electricity usage and time required during training, along with other relevant statistics. We then apply three compression techniques: Steganographic capacity reduction, pruning, and low-rank factorization. In each of the resulting cases, we again measure the electricity usage, training time, model accuracy, and so on. We find that pruning and low-rank factorization offer no significant improvements with respect to energy usage or other related statistics, while steganographic capacity reduction provides major benefits in almost every case. We discuss the significance of these findings.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively follow user instructions. To improve training efficiency and reduce data redundancy, recent works use LLM-based scoring functions, e.g., Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD), to select high-quality instruction-tuning data with scores above a threshold. While these data selection methods often lead to models that can match or even exceed the performance of models trained on the full datasets, we identify two key limitations: (i) they assess quality at the sample level, ignoring token-level informativeness; and (ii) they overlook the robustness of the scoring method, often selecting a sample due to superficial lexical features instead of its true quality. In this work, we propose Token-Selective HIeRarchical Data Selection for Instruction Tuning (T-SHIRT), a novel data selection framework that introduces a new scoring method to include only informative tokens in quality evaluation and also promotes robust and reliable samples whose neighbors also show high quality with less local inconsistencies. We demonstrate that models instruction-tuned on a curated dataset (only 5% of the original size) using T-SHIRT can outperform those trained on the entire large-scale dataset by up to 5.48 points on average across eight benchmarks. Across various LLMs and training set scales, our method consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art data selection techniques, while also remaining both cost-effective and highly efficient. For instance, by using GPT-2 for score computation, we are able to process a dataset of 52k samples using 40 minutes on a single GPU.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to expunge a designated forget set from a trained model without costly retraining, yet the existing techniques overlook two critical blind spots: "over-unlearning" that deteriorates retained data near the forget set, and post-hoc "relearning" attacks that aim to resurrect the forgotten knowledge. We first derive the over-unlearning metric OU@{\epsilon}, which represents the collateral damage to the nearby region of the forget set, where the over-unlearning mainly appears. Next, we expose an unforeseen relearning threat on MU, i.e., the Prototypical Relearning Attack, which exploits the per-class prototype of the forget class with just a few samples, and easily restores the pre-unlearning performance. To counter both blind spots, we introduce Spotter, a plug-and-play objective that combines (i) a masked knowledge-distillation penalty on the nearby region of forget set to suppress OU@{\epsilon}, and (ii) an intra-class dispersion loss that scatters forget-class embeddings, neutralizing prototypical relearning attacks. On CIFAR-10, as one of validations, Spotter reduces OU@{\epsilon}by below the 0.05X of the baseline, drives forget accuracy to 0%, preserves accuracy of the retain set within 1% of difference with the original, and denies the prototype-attack by keeping the forget set accuracy within <1%, without accessing retained data. It confirms that Spotter is a practical remedy of the unlearning's blind spots.

Abstract: We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.

Abstract: Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks, creating data samples by progressively denoising an initial random state. Traditionally, this initial state is sampled from a simple, fixed distribution like isotropic Gaussian, inherently lacking structure and a direct mechanism for external control. While recent efforts have explored ways to introduce controllability into the diffusion process, particularly at the initialization stage, they often rely on deterministic or heuristic approaches. These methods can be suboptimal, lack expressiveness, and are difficult to scale or integrate into more sophisticated optimization frameworks. In this paper, we introduce NoiseAR, a novel method for AutoRegressive Initial Noise Prior for Diffusion Models. Instead of a static, unstructured source, NoiseAR learns to generate a dynamic and controllable prior distribution for the initial noise. We formulate the generation of the initial noise prior's parameters as an autoregressive probabilistic modeling task over spatial patches or tokens. This approach enables NoiseAR to capture complex spatial dependencies and introduce learned structure into the initial state. Crucially, NoiseAR is designed to be conditional, allowing text prompts to directly influence the learned prior, thereby achieving fine-grained control over the diffusion initialization. Our experiments demonstrate that NoiseAR can generate initial noise priors that lead to improved sample quality and enhanced consistency with conditional inputs, offering a powerful, learned alternative to traditional random initialization. A key advantage of NoiseAR is its probabilistic formulation, which naturally supports seamless integration into probabilistic frameworks like Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning.

<title>Invariance Makes LLM Unlearning Resilient Even to Unanticipated Downstream Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning offers a promising solution to privacy and safety concerns in large language models (LLMs) by selectively removing targeted knowledge while preserving utility. However, current methods are highly sensitive to downstream fine-tuning, which can quickly recover forgotten information-even from unrelated tasks. To address this, we introduce invariance into unlearning for the first time, inspired by invariant risk minimization (IRM). Building on this principle, we propose invariant LLM unlearning (ILU), a regularization-based framework that enhances robustness. Notably, ILU generalizes well to diverse fine-tuning tasks, even when trained using a single dataset. A task vector analysis is also provided to further elucidate the rationale behind ILU's effectiveness. Extensive experiments on the WMDP and MUSE benchmark, reveal that ILU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods, including negative preference optimization (NPO) and representation misdirection for unlearning (RMU). Notably, ILU achieves superior unlearning robustness across diverse downstream fine-tuning scenarios (e.g., math, paraphrase detection, and sentiment analysis) while preserving the fine-tuning performance.

arXiv:2506.01348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative approach that incorporates a Distributionally Robust Learning (DRL) approach into Cox regression to enhance the robustness and accuracy of survival predictions. By formulating a DRL framework with a Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set, we develop a variant Cox model that is less sensitive to assumptions about the underlying data distribution and more resilient to model misspecification and data perturbations. By leveraging Wasserstein duality, we reformulate the original min-max DRL problem into a tractable regularized empirical risk minimization problem, which can be computed by exponential conic programming. We provide guarantees on the finite sample behavior of our DRL-Cox model. Moreover, through extensive simulations and real world case studies, we demonstrate that our regression model achieves superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness compared with traditional methods.

<title>Variational Adaptive Noise and Dropout towards Stable Recurrent Neural Networks</title>

arXiv:2506.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel stable learning theory for recurrent neural networks (RNNs), so-called variational adaptive noise and dropout (VAND). As stabilizing factors for RNNs, noise and dropout on the internal state of RNNs have been separately confirmed in previous studies. We reinterpret the optimization problem of RNNs as variational inference, showing that noise and dropout can be derived simultaneously by transforming the explicit regularization term arising in the optimization problem into implicit regularization. Their scale and ratio can also be adjusted appropriately to optimize the main objective of RNNs, respectively. In an imitation learning scenario with a mobile manipulator, only VAND is able to imitate sequential and periodic behaviors as instructed. https://youtu.be/UOho3Xr6A2w

<title>TAH-QUANT: Effective Activation Quantization in Pipeline Parallelism over Slow Network</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized training of large language models offers the opportunity to pool computational resources across geographically distributed participants but faces significant network communication bottlenecks, particularly in pipeline-parallel settings. While pipeline parallelism partitions model layers across devices to handle large-scale models, it necessitates frequent communication of intermediate activations, creating challenges when network bandwidth is limited. Existing activation compression methods, such as AQ-SGD, mitigate quantization-induced errors through error compensation but impose prohibitive memory overhead by requiring storage of previous activations. To address these issues, we introduce TAH-Quant (Tile-wise Adaptive Hadamard Quantization), a novel activation quantization framework designed specifically for pipeline parallelism. Our approach integrates fine-grained tile-wise quantization for precise control, entropy-guided token-level adaptive bit allocation for optimal bit usage, and a Hadamard-based transform with pivot element swapping to effectively suppress quantization outliers. We further provide a theoretical analysis, proving that pipeline parallel training equipped with TAH-Quant maintains a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, matching that of vanilla stochastic gradient descent. Extensive experiments on diverse LLM tasks demonstrate that TAH-Quant achieves aggressive activation quantization (3-4 bits) ratio, which provides up to 4.3$\times$ end-to-end speedup without compromising training convergence, matches state-of-the-art methods, incurs no extra memory overhead, and generalizes well across different training scenarios.

<title>Two-Stage Learning of Stabilizing Neural Controllers via Zubov Sampling and Iterative Domain Expansion</title>

arXiv:2506.01356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive empirical performance. However, obtaining stability guarantees and estimations of the region of attraction of these learned neural controllers is challenging due to the lack of stable and scalable training and verification algorithms. Although previous works in this area have achieved great success, much conservatism remains in their framework. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage training framework to jointly synthesize the controller and Lyapunov function for continuous-time systems. By leveraging a Zubov-inspired region of attraction characterization to directly estimate stability boundaries, we propose a novel training data sampling strategy and a domain updating mechanism that significantly reduces the conservatism in training. Moreover, unlike existing works on continuous-time systems that rely on an SMT solver to formally verify the Lyapunov condition, we extend state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN with the capability of performing automatic bound propagation through the Jacobian of dynamical systems and a novel verification scheme that avoids expensive bisection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct numerical experiments by synthesizing and verifying controllers on several challenging nonlinear systems across multiple dimensions. We show that our training can yield region of attractions with volume $5 - 1.5\cdot 10^{5}$ times larger compared to the baselines, and our verification on continuous systems can be up to $40-10000$ times faster compared to the traditional SMT solver dReal.

<title>RDB2G-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Automatic Graph Modeling of Relational Databases</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are composed of interconnected tables, where relationships between them are defined through foreign keys. Recent research on applying machine learning to RDBs has explored graph-based representations of RDBs, where rows of tables are modeled as nodes, and foreign key relationships are modeled as edges. RDB-to-graph modeling helps capture cross-table dependencies, ultimately leading to enhanced performance across diverse tasks. However, there are numerous ways to model RDBs as graphs, and performance varies significantly depending on the chosen graph model. In our analysis, applying a common heuristic rule for graph modeling leads to up to a 10% drop in performance compared to the best-performing graph model, which remains non-trivial to identify. To foster research on intelligent RDB-to-graph modeling, we introduce RDB2G-Bench, the first benchmark framework for evaluating such methods. We construct extensive datasets covering 5 real-world RDBs and 12 predictive tasks, resulting in around 50k graph-performance pairs for efficient and reproducible evaluations. Thanks to our precomputed datasets, we were able to benchmark 9 automatic RDB-to-graph modeling methods on the 12 tasks over 600x faster than on-the-fly evaluation, which requires repeated model training. Our analysis of the datasets and benchmark results reveals key structural patterns affecting graph model effectiveness, along with practical implications for effective graph modeling.

Abstract: Robust causal discovery in time series datasets depends on reliable benchmark datasets with known ground-truth causal relationships. However, such datasets remain scarce, and existing synthetic alternatives often overlook critical temporal properties inherent in real-world data, including nonstationarity driven by trends and seasonality, irregular sampling intervals, and the presence of unobserved confounders. To address these challenges, we introduce TimeGraph, a comprehensive suite of synthetic time-series benchmark datasets that systematically incorporates both linear and nonlinear dependencies while modeling key temporal characteristics such as trends, seasonal effects, and heterogeneous noise patterns. Each dataset is accompanied by a fully specified causal graph featuring varying densities and diverse noise distributions and is provided in two versions: one including unobserved confounders and one without, thereby offering extensive coverage of real-world complexity while preserving methodological neutrality. We further demonstrate the utility of TimeGraph through systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms including PCMCI+, LPCMCI, and FGES across a diverse array of configurations and metrics. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithmic performance under realistic temporal conditions, underscoring the need for robust synthetic benchmarks in the fair and transparent assessment of causal discovery methods. The complete TimeGraph suite, including dataset generation scripts, evaluation metrics, and recommended experimental protocols, is freely available to facilitate reproducible research and foster community-driven advancements in time-series causal discovery.

<title>Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.

<title>Incentivizing LLMs to Self-Verify Their Answers</title>

arXiv:2506.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks through both post-training and test-time scaling laws. While prevalent test-time scaling approaches are often realized by using external reward models to guide the model generation process, we find only marginal gains can be acquired when scaling a model post-trained on specific reasoning tasks. We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution discrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general reward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to self-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification within a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model can further scale its performance during inference time by verifying its generations, without the need for external verifiers. We train our self-verification models based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, demonstrating its capabilities across varying reasoning context lengths. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our models can not only improve post-training performance but also enable effective test-time scaling.

<title>Compiler Optimization via LLM Reasoning for Efficient Model Serving</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimization to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed REASONING COMPILER) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process, guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-aware transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.

<title>Modeling All-Atom Glycan Structures via Hierarchical Message Passing and Multi-Scale Pre-training</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the various properties of glycans with machine learning has shown some preliminary promise. However, previous methods mainly focused on modeling the backbone structure of glycans as graphs of monosaccharides (i.e., sugar units), while they neglected the atomic structures underlying each monosaccharide, which are actually important indicators of glycan properties. We fill this blank by introducing the GlycanAA model for All-Atom-wise Glycan modeling. GlycanAA models a glycan as a heterogeneous graph with monosaccharide nodes representing its global backbone structure and atom nodes representing its local atomic-level structures. Based on such a graph, GlycanAA performs hierarchical message passing to capture from local atomic-level interactions to global monosaccharide-level interactions. To further enhance model capability, we pre-train GlycanAA on a high-quality unlabeled glycan dataset, deriving the PreGlycanAA model. We design a multi-scale mask prediction algorithm to endow the model about different levels of dependencies in a glycan. Extensive benchmark results show the superiority of GlycanAA over existing glycan encoders and verify the further improvements achieved by PreGlycanAA. We maintain all resources at https://github.com/kasawa1234/GlycanAA

arXiv:2506.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model editing has become an important tool for addressing privacy, bias, and misinformation in large language models (LLMs) by enabling updates to knowledge without the need for retraining from scratch. However, existing editing techniques often target isolated facts, ignoring ripple effects on related knowledge, allowing edited facts to remain deducible and compromising broader contextual integrity. For example, changing Harry Potter's school from Hogwarts to Ilvermorny requires reassigning his house from Gryffindor to a suitable alternative while preserving Gryffindor's relationship with Hogwarts. In this work, we present a new model-editing setting, deep editing, to show: (1) how editing techniques fail to handle connected facts, evaluating how original knowledge sneaks through unchanged causal links, and (2) their impact on broader contextual knowledge. We introduce ThinkEval, a framework to systematically evaluate model- editing techniques by building model-specific knowledge graphs to analyze pre- and post-edit effects on fact persistence and catastrophic forgetting. We present KnowGIC, a benchmark created with ThinkEval, consisting of sequentially linked queries to measure these effects. We evaluate five editing techniques: AlphaEdit, RECT, ROME, MEMIT, and PRUNE across multiple LLMs. We find that these techniques struggle to balance indirect fact suppression with the preservation of related knowledge. Our dataset is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowGIC.

Abstract: The increasing scale of modern neural networks, exemplified by architectures from IBM (530 billion neurons) and Google (500 billion parameters), presents significant challenges in terms of computational cost and infrastructure requirements. As deep neural networks continue to grow, traditional training paradigms relying on monolithic GPU clusters become increasingly unsustainable. This paper proposes a distributed system architecture that partitions a neural network across multiple servers, each responsible for a subset of neurons. Neurons are classified as local or remote, with inter-server connections managed via a metadata-driven lookup mechanism. A Multi-Part Neural Network Execution Engine facilitates seamless execution and training across distributed partitions by dynamically resolving and invoking remote neurons using stored metadata. All servers share a unified model through a network file system (NFS), ensuring consistency during parallel updates. A Neuron Distributor module enables flexible partitioning strategies based on neuron count, percentage, identifiers, or network layers. This architecture enables cost-effective, scalable deployment of deep learning models on cloud infrastructure, reducing dependency on high-performance centralized compute resources.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Bayesian optimization problem (also referred to as the Bayesian setting of the Gaussian process bandit), where the learner seeks to minimize the regret under a function drawn from a known Gaussian process (GP). Under a Mat\'ern kernel with a certain degree of smoothness, we show that the Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret with high probability. Furthermore, our analysis yields $O(\sqrt{T \ln^4 T})$ regret under a squared exponential kernel. These results fill the gap between the existing regret upper bound for GP-UCB and the best-known bound provided by Scarlett (2018). The key idea in our proof is to capture the concentration behavior of the input sequence realized by GP-UCB, enabling a more refined analysis of the GP's information gain.

arXiv:2506.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become an essential framework for privacy-preserving machine learning. Existing DP learning methods, however, often have disparate impacts on model predictions, e.g., for minority groups. Gradient clipping, which is often used in DP learning, can suppress larger gradients from challenging samples. We show that this problem is amplified by adaptive clipping, which will often shrink the clipping bound to tiny values to match a well-fitting majority, while significantly reducing the accuracy for others. We propose bounded adaptive clipping, which introduces a tunable lower bound to prevent excessive gradient suppression. Our method improves the accuracy of the worst-performing class on average over 10 percentage points on skewed MNIST and Fashion MNIST compared to the unbounded adaptive clipping, and over 5 percentage points over constant clipping.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative error feedback framework designed to mitigate quantization noise in distributed graph filtering, where communications are constrained to quantized messages. It comes from error spectrum shaping techniques from state-space digital filters, and therefore establishes connections between quantized filtering processes over different domains. In contrast to existing error compensation methods, our framework quantitatively feeds back the quantization noise for exact compensation. We examine the framework under three key scenarios: (i) deterministic graph filtering, (ii) graph filtering over random graphs, and (iii) graph filtering with random node-asynchronous updates. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces the effect of quantization noise, and we provide closed-form solutions for the optimal error feedback coefficients. Moreover, this quantitative error feedback mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into communication-efficient decentralized optimization frameworks, enabling lower error floors. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, consistently showing that our method outperforms conventional quantization strategies in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

<title>SOC-DGL: Social Interaction Behavior Inspired Dual Graph Learning Framework for Drug-Target Interaction Identification</title>

Abstract: The identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) is crucial for drug discovery and repositioning, as it reveals potential uses of existing drugs, aiding in the acceleration of the drug development process and reducing associated costs. Despite the similarity information in DTI is important, most models are limited to mining direct similarity information within homogeneous graphs, overlooking the potential yet rich similarity information in heterogeneous graphs. Inspired by real-world social interaction behaviors, we propose SOC-DGL, which comprises two specialized modules: the Affinity-Driven Graph Learning (ADGL) module and the Equilibrium-Driven Graph Learning (EDGL) module. The ADGL module adopts a comprehensive social interaction strategy, leveraging an affinity-enhanced global drug-target graph to learn both global DTI and the individual similarity information of drugs and targets. In contrast, the EDGL module employs a higher-order social interaction strategy, amplifying the influence of even-hop neighbors through an even-polynomial graph filter grounded in balance theory, enabling the indirect mining of higher-order homogeneous information. This dual approach enables SOC-DGL to effectively and comprehensively capture similarity information across diverse interaction scales within the affinity matrices and drug-target association matrices, significantly enhancing the model's generalization capability and predictive accuracy in DTI tasks. To address the issue of imbalance in drug-target interaction datasets, this paper proposes an adjustable imbalance loss function that mitigates the impact of sample imbalance by adjusting the weight of negative samples and a parameter. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate significant accuracy improvements achieved by SOC-DGL, particularly in scenarios involving data imbalance and unseen drugs or targets.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches process data in a layer-by-layer way with intermediate (or latent) features. We aim at designing a general solution to optimize the latent manifolds to improve the performance on classification, segmentation, completion and/or reconstruction through probabilistic models. This paper proposes a variational inference model which leads to a clustered embedding. We introduce additional variables in the latent space, called \textbf{nebula anchors}, that guide the latent variables to form clusters during training. To prevent the anchors from clustering among themselves, we employ the variational constraint that enforces the latent features within an anchor to form a Gaussian distribution, resulting in a generative model we refer as Nebula Variational Coding (NVC). Since each latent feature can be labeled with the closest anchor, we also propose to apply metric learning in a self-supervised way to make the separation between clusters more explicit. As a consequence, the latent variables of our variational coder form clusters which adapt to the generated semantic of the training data, \textit{e.g.} the categorical labels of each sample. We demonstrate experimentally that it can be used within different architectures designed to solve different problems including text sequence, images, 3D point clouds and volumetric data, validating the advantage of our proposed method.

<title>Variance-Based Defense Against Blended Backdoor Attacks</title>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation, we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset, detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.

Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things environments increasingly rely on advanced Anomaly Detection and explanation techniques to rapidly detect and mitigate cyberincidents, thereby ensuring operational safety. The sequential nature of data collected from these environments has enabled improvements in Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by processing time windows rather than treating the data as tabular. However, conventional explanation methods often neglect this temporal structure, leading to imprecise or less actionable explanations. This work presents ShaTS (Shapley values for Time Series models), which is a model-agnostic explainable Artificial Intelligence method designed to enhance the precision of Shapley value explanations for time series models. ShaTS addresses the shortcomings of traditional approaches by incorporating an a priori feature grouping strategy that preserves temporal dependencies and produces both coherent and actionable insights. Experiments conducted on the SWaT dataset demonstrate that ShaTS accurately identifies critical time instants, precisely pinpoints the sensors, actuators, and processes affected by anomalies, and outperforms SHAP in terms of both explainability and resource efficiency, fulfilling the real-time requirements of industrial environments.

<title>Feature-aware Hypergraph Generation via Next-Scale Prediction</title>

Abstract: Hypergraphs generalize traditional graphs by allowing hyperedges to connect multiple nodes, making them well-suited for modeling complex structures with higher-order relationships, such as 3D meshes, molecular systems, and electronic circuits. While topology is central to hypergraph structure, many real-world applications also require node and hyperedge features. Existing hypergraph generation methods focus solely on topology, often overlooking feature modeling. In this work, we introduce FAHNES (feature-aware hypergraph generation via next-scale prediction), a hierarchical approach that jointly generates hypergraph topology and features. FAHNES builds a multi-scale representation through node coarsening, then learns to reconstruct finer levels via localized expansion and refinement, guided by a new node budget mechanism that controls cluster splitting. We evaluate FAHNES on synthetic hypergraphs, 3D meshes, and molecular datasets. FAHNES achieves competitive results in reconstructing topology and features, establishing a foundation for future research in featured hypergraph generative modeling.

Abstract: Understanding the interaction between different drugs (drug-drug interaction or DDI) is critical for ensuring patient safety and optimizing therapeutic outcomes. Existing DDI datasets primarily focus on textual information, overlooking multimodal data that reflect complex drug mechanisms. In this paper, we (1) introduce MUDI, a large-scale Multimodal biomedical dataset for Understanding pharmacodynamic Drug-drug Interactions, and (2) benchmark learning methods to study it. In brief, MUDI provides a comprehensive multimodal representation of drugs by combining pharmacological text, chemical formulas, molecular structure graphs, and images across 310,532 annotated drug pairs labeled as Synergism, Antagonism, or New Effect. Crucially, to effectively evaluate machine-learning based generalization, MUDI consists of unseen drug pairs in the test set. We evaluate benchmark models using both late fusion voting and intermediate fusion strategies. All data, annotations, evaluation scripts, and baselines are released under an open research license.

<title>Automatic Stage Lighting Control: Is it a Rule-Driven Process or Generative Task?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01482</link>

Abstract: Stage lighting plays an essential role in live music performances, influencing the engaging experience of both musicians and audiences. Given the high costs associated with hiring or training professional lighting engineers, Automatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has gained increasing attention. However, most existing approaches only classify music into limited categories and map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and monotonous outcomes that lack rationality. To address this issue, this paper presents an end-to-end solution that directly learns from experienced lighting engineers -- Skip-BART. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to conceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification problem. Our method modifies the BART model to take audio music as input and produce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip connection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within the frame grid.We validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an human evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional rule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap compared to real lighting engineers.Specifically, our method yields a p-value of 0.72 in a statistical comparison based on human evaluations with human lighting engineers, suggesting that the proposed approach closely matches human lighting engineering performance. To support further research, we have made our self-collected dataset, code, and trained model parameters available at https://github.com/RS2002/Skip-BART .

<title>Model-agnostic Mitigation Strategies of Data Imbalance for Regression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Data imbalance persists as a pervasive challenge in regression tasks, introducing bias in model performance and undermining predictive reliability. This is particularly detrimental in applications aimed at predicting rare events that fall outside the domain of the bulk of the training data. In this study, we review the current state-of-the-art regarding sampling-based methods and cost-sensitive learning. Additionally, we propose novel approaches to mitigate model bias. To better asses the importance of data, we introduce the density-distance and density-ratio relevance functions, which effectively integrate empirical frequency of data with domain-specific preferences, offering enhanced interpretability for end-users. Furthermore, we present advanced mitigation techniques (cSMOGN and crbSMOGN), which build upon and improve existing sampling methods. In a comprehensive quantitative evaluation, we benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 10 synthetic and 42 real-world datasets, using neural networks, XGBoosting trees and Random Forest models. Our analysis reveals that while most strategies improve performance on rare samples, they often degrade it on frequent ones. We demonstrate that constructing an ensemble of models -- one trained with imbalance mitigation and another without -- can significantly reduce these negative effects. The key findings underscore the superior performance of our novel crbSMOGN sampling technique with the density-ratio relevance function for neural networks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Confidence-Aware Self-Distillation for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Incomplete Modalities</title>

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human sentiment through multimodal data. In real-world scenarios, practical factors often lead to uncertain modality missingness. Existing methods for handling modality missingness are based on data reconstruction or common subspace projections. However, these methods neglect the confidence in multimodal combinations and impose constraints on intra-class representation, hindering the capture of modality-specific information and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that effectively incorporates multimodal probabilistic embeddings via a mixture of Student's $t$-distributions, enhancing its robustness by incorporating confidence and accommodating heavy-tailed properties. This strategy estimates joint distributions with uncertainty scores and reduces uncertainty in the student network by consistency distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a reparameterization representation module that facilitates CASD in robust multimodal learning by sampling embeddings from the joint distribution for the prediction module to calculate the task loss. As a result, the directional constraint from the loss minimization is alleviated by the sampled representation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Learning population dynamics involves recovering the underlying process that governs particle evolution, given evolutionary snapshots of samples at discrete time points. Recent methods frame this as an energy minimization problem in probability space and leverage the celebrated JKO scheme for efficient time discretization. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{iJKOnet}$, an approach that combines the JKO framework with inverse optimization techniques to learn population dynamics. Our method relies on a conventional $\textit{end-to-end}$ adversarial training procedure and does not require restrictive architectural choices, e.g., input-convex neural networks. We establish theoretical guarantees for our methodology and demonstrate improved performance over prior JKO-based methods.

Abstract: With the rise of large pre-trained foundation models for automatic speech recognition new challenges appear. While the performance of these models is good, runtime and cost of inference increases. One approach to make use of their strength while retaining efficiency is to distill their knowledge to smaller models during training. In this work, we explore different CTC-based distillation variants, focusing on blank token handling. We show that common approaches like blank elimination do not always work off the shelf. We explore new blank selection patterns as a potential sweet spot between standard knowledge distillation and blank elimination mechanisms. Through the introduction of a symmetric selection method, we are able to remove the CTC loss during knowledge distillation with minimal to no performance degradation. With this, we make the training independent from target labels, potentially allowing for distillation on untranscribed audio data.

<title>Beyond Diagonal Covariance: Flexible Posterior VAEs via Free-Form Injective Flows</title>

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models widely used for learning interpretable latent spaces, quantifying uncertainty, and compressing data for downstream generative tasks. VAEs typically rely on diagonal Gaussian posteriors due to computational constraints. Using arguments grounded in differential geometry, we demonstrate inherent limitations in the representational capacity of diagonal covariance VAEs, as illustrated by explicit low-dimensional examples. In response, we show that a regularized variant of the recently introduced Free-form Injective Flow (FIF) can be interpreted as a VAE featuring a highly flexible, implicitly defined posterior. Crucially, this regularization yields a posterior equivalent to a full Gaussian covariance distribution, yet maintains computational costs comparable to standard diagonal covariance VAEs. Experiments on image datasets validate our approach, demonstrating that incorporating full covariance substantially improves model likelihood.

<title>Alignment as Distribution Learning: Your Preference Model is Explicitly a Language Model</title>

arXiv:2506.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant paradigm for controlling the quality of outputs from large language models (LLMs). However, when viewed as `loss + regularization,' the standard RLHF objective lacks theoretical justification and incentivizes degenerate, deterministic solutions, an issue that variants such as Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) also inherit. In this paper, we rethink alignment by framing it as \emph{distribution learning} from pairwise preference feedback by explicitly modeling how information about the target language model bleeds through the preference data. This explicit modeling leads us to propose three principled learning objectives: preference maximum likelihood estimation, preference distillation, and reverse KL minimization. We theoretically show that all three approaches enjoy strong non-asymptotic $O(1/n)$ convergence to the target language model, naturally avoiding degeneracy and reward overfitting. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our distribution learning framework, especially preference distillation, consistently outperforms or matches the performances of RLHF and DPO across various tasks and models.

Abstract: Learning meaningful abstract models of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is crucial for improving generalization from limited data. In this work, we show how geometric priors can be imposed on the low-dimensional representation manifold of a learned transition model. We incorporate known symmetric structures via appropriate choices of the latent space and the associated group actions, which encode prior knowledge about invariances in the environment. In addition, our framework allows the embedding of additional unstructured information alongside these symmetries. We show experimentally that this leads to better predictions of the latent transition model than fully unstructured approaches, as well as better learning on downstream RL tasks, in environments with rotational and translational features, including in first-person views of 3D environments. Additionally, our experiments show that this leads to simpler and more disentangled representations. The full code is available on GitHub to ensure reproducibility.

<title>A Diffusion-Based Method for Learning the Multi-Outcome Distribution of Medical Treatments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01533</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medicine, treatments often influence multiple, interdependent outcomes, such as primary endpoints, complications, adverse events, or other secondary endpoints. Hence, to make optimal treatment decisions, clinicians are interested in learning the distribution of multi-dimensional treatment outcomes. However, the vast majority of machine learning methods for predicting treatment effects focus on single-outcome settings, despite the fact that medical data often include multiple, interdependent outcomes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based method called DIME to learn the joint distribution of multiple outcomes of medical treatments. We addresses three challenges relevant in medical practice: (i)it is tailored to learn the joint interventional distribution of multiple medical outcomes, which enables reliable decision-making with uncertainty quantification rather than relying solely on point estimates; (ii)it explicitly captures the dependence structure between outcomes; (iii)it can handle outcomes of mixed type, including binary, categorical, and continuous variables. In DIME, we take into account the fundamental problem of causal inference through causal masking. For training, our method decomposes the joint distribution into a series of conditional distributions with a customized conditional masking to account for the dependence structure across outcomes. For inference, our method auto-regressively generates predictions. This allows our method to move beyond point estimates of causal quantities and thus learn the joint interventional distribution. To the best of our knowledge, DIME is the first neural method tailored to learn the joint, multi-outcome distribution of medical treatments. Across various experiments, we demonstrate that our method effectively learns the joint distribution and captures shared information among multiple outcomes.

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges and benefits of a trainable destruction process in diffusion samplers -- diffusion-based generative models trained to sample an unnormalised density without access to data samples. Contrary to the majority of work that views diffusion samplers as approximations to an underlying continuous-time model, we view diffusion models as discrete-time policies trained to produce samples in very few generation steps. We propose to trade some of the elegance of the underlying theory for flexibility in the definition of the generative and destruction policies. In particular, we decouple the generation and destruction variances, enabling both transition kernels to be learned as unconstrained Gaussian densities. We show that, when the number of steps is limited, training both generation and destruction processes results in faster convergence and improved sampling quality on various benchmarks. Through a robust ablation study, we investigate the design choices necessary to facilitate stable training. Finally, we show the scalability of our approach through experiments on GAN latent space sampling for conditional image generation.

Abstract: We introduce Temporal Variational Implicit Neural Representations (TV-INRs), a probabilistic framework for modeling irregular multivariate time series that enables efficient individualized imputation and forecasting. By integrating implicit neural representations with latent variable models, TV-INRs learn distributions over time-continuous generator functions conditioned on signal-specific covariates. Unlike existing approaches that require extensive training, fine-tuning or meta-learning, our method achieves accurate individualized predictions through a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single TV-INRs instance, we can accurately solve diverse imputation and forecasting tasks, offering a computationally efficient and scalable solution for real-world applications. TV-INRs excel especially in low-data regimes, where it outperforms existing methods by an order of magnitude in mean squared error for imputation task.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithm selection is commonly used to predict the best solver from a portfolio per per-instance. In many real scenarios, instances arrive in a stream: new instances become available over time, while the number of class labels can also grow as new data distributions arrive downstream. As a result, the classification model needs to be periodically updated to reflect additional solvers without catastrophic forgetting of past data. In machine-learning (ML), this is referred to as Class Incremental Learning (CIL). While commonly addressed in ML settings, its relevance to algorithm-selection in optimisation has not been previously studied. Using a bin-packing dataset, we benchmark 8 continual learning methods with respect to their ability to withstand catastrophic forgetting. We find that rehearsal-based methods significantly outperform other CIL methods. While there is evidence of forgetting, the loss is small at around 7%. Hence, these methods appear to be a viable approach to continual learning in streaming optimisation scenarios.

Abstract: Hierarchical classification offers an approach to incorporate the concept of mistake severity by leveraging a structured, labeled hierarchy. However, decoding in such settings frequently relies on heuristic decision rules, which may not align with task-specific evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose a framework for the optimal decoding of an output probability distribution with respect to a target metric. We derive optimal decision rules for increasingly complex prediction settings, providing universal algorithms when candidates are limited to the set of nodes. In the most general case of predicting a subset of nodes, we focus on rules dedicated to the hierarchical $hF_{\beta}$ scores, tailored to hierarchical settings. To demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations, showcasing the superiority of our proposed optimal strategies, particularly in underdetermined scenarios. These results highlight the potential of our methods to enhance the performance and reliability of hierarchical classifiers in real-world applications.

Abstract: The softmax function is a fundamental building block of deep neural networks, commonly used to define output distributions in classification tasks or attention weights in transformer architectures. Despite its widespread use and proven effectiveness, its influence on learning dynamics and learned representations remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to optimize model behavior. In this paper, we study the pivotal role of the softmax function in shaping the model's representation. We introduce the concept of rank deficit bias - a phenomenon in which softmax-based deep networks find solutions of rank much lower than the number of classes. This bias depends on the softmax function's logits norm, which is implicitly influenced by hyperparameters or directly modified by softmax temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to exploit the softmax dynamics to learn compressed representations or to enhance their performance on out-of-distribution data. We validate our findings across diverse architectures and real-world datasets, highlighting the broad applicability of temperature tuning in improving model performance. Our work provides new insights into the mechanisms of softmax, enabling better control over representation learning in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Being able to solve a task in diverse ways makes agents more robust to task variations and less prone to local optima. In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.

Abstract: This paper introduces a topological framework for interpreting the internal representations of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We construct a simplicial tower, a sequence of simplicial complexes connected by simplicial maps, that captures how data topology evolves across network layers. Our approach enables bi-persistence analysis: layer persistence tracks topological features within each layer across scales, while MLP persistence reveals how these features transform through the network. We prove stability theorems for our topological descriptors and establish that linear separability in latent spaces is related to disconnected components in the nerve complexes. To make our framework practical, we develop a combinatorial algorithm for computing MLP persistence and introduce trajectory-based visualisations that track data flow through the network. Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical data demonstrate our method's ability to identify redundant layers, reveal critical topological transitions, and provide interpretable insights into how MLPs progressively organise data for classification.

Abstract: We introduce the attention-indexed model (AIM), a theoretical framework for analyzing learning in deep attention layers. Inspired by multi-index models, AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions over high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike prior tractable attention models, AIM allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance. AIM offers a solvable playground for understanding learning in modern attention architectures.

Abstract: Developing machine learning (ML) models requires a deep understanding of real-world problems, which are inherently multi-objective. In this paper, we present VirnyFlow, the first design space for responsible model development, designed to assist data scientists in building ML pipelines that are tailored to the specific context of their problem. Unlike conventional AutoML frameworks, VirnyFlow enables users to define customized optimization criteria, perform comprehensive experimentation across pipeline stages, and iteratively refine models in alignment with real-world constraints. Our system integrates evaluation protocol definition, multi-objective Bayesian optimization, cost-aware multi-armed bandits, query optimization, and distributed parallelism into a unified architecture. We show that VirnyFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML systems in both optimization quality and scalability across five real-world benchmarks, offering a flexible, efficient, and responsible alternative to black-box automation in ML development.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly embedded into society through high-stakes decision-making, selecting the right algorithm for a given task, audience, and sector presents a critical challenge, particularly in the context of fairness. Traditional assessments of model fairness have often framed fairness as an objective mathematical property, treating model selection as an optimization problem under idealized informational conditions. This overlooks model multiplicity as a consideration--that multiple models can deliver similar performance while exhibiting different fairness characteristics. Legal scholars have engaged this challenge through the concept of Less Discriminatory Algorithms (LDAs), which frames model selection as a civil rights obligation. In real-world deployment, this normative challenge is bounded by constraints on fairness experimentation, e.g., regulatory standards, institutional priorities, and resource capacity.
  Against these considerations, the paper revisits Lee and Floridi (2021)'s relational fairness approach using updated 2021 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, and proposes an expansion of the scope of the LDA search process. We argue that extending the LDA search horizontally, considering fairness across model families themselves, provides a lightweight complement, or alternative, to within-model hyperparameter optimization, when operationalizing fairness in non-experimental, resource constrained settings. Fairness metrics alone offer useful, but insufficient signals to accurately evaluate candidate LDAs. Rather, by using a horizontal LDA search approach with the relational trade-off framework, we demonstrate a responsible minimum viable LDA search on real-world lending outcomes. Organizations can modify this approach to systematically compare, evaluate, and select LDAs that optimize fairness and accuracy in a sector-based contextualized manner.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning has applications in recommendation systems, traffic forecasting, and social network analysis. Although multiple architectures have been introduced, progress in positional encoding for temporal graphs remains limited. Extending static Laplacian eigenvector approaches to temporal graphs through the supra-Laplacian has shown promise, but also poses key challenges: high eigendecomposition costs, limited theoretical understanding, and ambiguity about when and how to apply these encodings. In this paper, we address these issues by (1) offering a theoretical framework that connects supra-Laplacian encodings to per-time-slice encodings, highlighting the benefits of leveraging additional temporal connectivity, (2) introducing novel methods to reduce the computational overhead, achieving up to 56x faster runtimes while scaling to graphs with 50,000 active nodes, and (3) conducting an extensive experimental study to identify which models, tasks, and datasets benefit most from these encodings. Our findings reveal that while positional encodings can significantly boost performance in certain scenarios, their effectiveness varies across different models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies represented in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) offer powerful representational capabilities. While second-order optimization methods like Newton's method demonstrate faster convergence than first-order approaches, current RKHS-based policy optimization remains constrained to first-order techniques. This limitation stems primarily from the intractability of explicitly computing and inverting the infinite-dimensional Hessian operator in RKHS. We introduce Policy Newton in RKHS, the first second-order optimization framework specifically designed for RL policies represented in RKHS. Our approach circumvents direct computation of the inverse Hessian operator by optimizing a cubic regularized auxiliary objective function. Crucially, we leverage the Representer Theorem to transform this infinite-dimensional optimization into an equivalent, computationally tractable finite-dimensional problem whose dimensionality scales with the trajectory data volume. We establish theoretical guarantees proving convergence to a local optimum with a local quadratic convergence rate. Empirical evaluations on a toy financial asset allocation problem validate these theoretical properties, while experiments on standard RL benchmarks demonstrate that Policy Newton in RKHS achieves superior convergence speed and higher episodic rewards compared to established first-order RKHS approaches and parametric second-order methods. Our work bridges a critical gap between non-parametric policy representations and second-order optimization methods in reinforcement learning.

<title>PMNO: A novel physics guided multi-step neural operator predictor for partial differential equations</title>

Abstract: Neural operators, which aim to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, have been widely applied in the simulation and prediction of physical systems. However, the limited representational capacity of network architectures, combined with their heavy reliance on large-scale data, often hinder effective training and result in poor extrapolation performance. In this paper, inspired by traditional numerical methods, we propose a novel physics guided multi-step neural operator (PMNO) architecture to address these challenges in long-horizon prediction of complex physical systems. Distinct from general operator learning methods, the PMNO framework replaces the single-step input with multi-step historical data in the forward pass and introduces an implicit time-stepping scheme based on the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) during backpropagation. This design not only strengthens the model's extrapolation capacity but also facilitates more efficient and stable training with fewer data samples, especially for long-term predictions. Meanwhile, a causal training strategy is employed to circumvent the need for multi-stage training and to ensure efficient end-to-end optimization. The neural operator architecture possesses resolution-invariant properties, enabling the trained model to perform fast extrapolation on arbitrary spatial resolutions. We demonstrate the superior predictive performance of PMNO predictor across a diverse range of physical systems, including 2D linear system, modeling over irregular domain, complex-valued wave dynamics, and reaction-diffusion processes. Depending on the specific problem setting, various neural operator architectures, including FNO, DeepONet, and their variants, can be seamlessly integrated into the PMNO framework.

Abstract: Neural models learn representations of high-dimensional data on low-dimensional manifolds. Multiple factors, including stochasticities in the training process, model architectures, and additional inductive biases, may induce different representations, even when learning the same task on the same data. However, it has recently been shown that when a latent structure is shared between distinct latent spaces, relative distances between representations can be preserved, up to distortions. Building on this idea, we demonstrate that exploiting the differential-geometric structure of latent spaces of neural models, it is possible to capture precisely the transformations between representational spaces trained on similar data distributions. Specifically, we assume that distinct neural models parametrize approximately the same underlying manifold, and introduce a representation based on the pullback metric that captures the intrinsic structure of the latent space, while scaling efficiently to large models. We validate experimentally our method on model stitching and retrieval tasks, covering autoencoders and vision foundation discriminative models, across diverse architectures, datasets, and pretraining schemes.

<title>Contrastive Learning for Efficient Transaction Validation in UTXO-based Blockchains</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01614</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01614</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) approach for scalability of UTXO-based blockchains, such as Bitcoin. Prior approaches to UTXO set sharding struggle with distributing UTXOs effectively across validators, creating substantial communication overhead due to child-parent transaction dependencies. This overhead, which arises from the need to locate parent UTXOs, significantly hampers transaction processing speeds. Our solution uses ML to optimize not only UTXO set sharding but also the routing of incoming transactions, ensuring that transactions are directed to shards containing their parent UTXOs. At the heart of our approach is a framework that combines contrastive and unsupervised learning to create an embedding space for transaction outputs. This embedding allows the model to group transaction outputs based on spending relationships, making it possible to route transactions efficiently to the correct validation microservices. Trained on historical transaction data with triplet loss and online semi-hard negative mining, the model embeds parent-child spending patterns directly into its parameters, thus eliminating the need for costly, real-time parent transaction lookups. This significantly reduces cross-shard communication overhead, boosting throughput and scalability.

Abstract: We address the problem of Gaussian Process (GP) optimization in the presence of unknown and potentially varying adversarial perturbations. Unlike traditional robust optimization approaches that focus on maximizing performance under worst-case scenarios, we consider a robust satisficing objective, where the goal is to consistently achieve a predefined performance threshold $\tau$, even under adversarial conditions. We propose two novel algorithms based on distinct formulations of robust satisficing, and show that they are instances of a general robust satisficing framework. Further, each algorithm offers different guarantees depending on the nature of the adversary. Specifically, we derive two regret bounds: one that is sublinear over time, assuming certain conditions on the adversary and the satisficing threshold $\tau$, and another that scales with the perturbation magnitude but requires no assumptions on the adversary. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the established robust optimization methods in achieving the satisficing objective, particularly when the ambiguity set of the robust optimization framework is inaccurately specified.

<title>Gradient-Based Model Fingerprinting for LLM Similarity Detection and Family Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01631</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral software components in modern applications, unauthorized model derivations through fine-tuning, merging, and redistribution have emerged as critical software engineering challenges. Unlike traditional software where clone detection and license compliance are well-established, the LLM ecosystem lacks effective mechanisms to detect model lineage and enforce licensing agreements. This gap is particularly problematic when open-source model creators, such as Meta's LLaMA, require derivative works to maintain naming conventions for attribution, yet no technical means exist to verify compliance.
  To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for LLM similarity detection and family classification. Our approach extracts model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training data, watermarks, or specific model formats. TensorGuard supports the widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints through statistical analysis of gradient features. These fingerprints enable two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models. Experimental evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94% classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.

<title>Bidirectional Soft Actor-Critic: Leveraging Forward and Reverse KL Divergence for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, a state-of-the-art method in maximum entropy reinforcement learning, traditionally relies on minimizing reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for policy updates. However, this approach leads to an intractable optimal projection policy, necessitating gradient-based approximations that can suffer from instability and poor sample efficiency. This paper investigates the alternative use of forward KL divergence within SAC. We demonstrate that for Gaussian policies, forward KL divergence yields an explicit optimal projection policy -- corresponding to the mean and variance of the target Boltzmann distribution's action marginals. Building on the distinct advantages of both KL directions, we propose Bidirectional SAC, an algorithm that first initializes the policy using the explicit forward KL projection and then refines it by optimizing the reverse KL divergence. Comprehensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks show that Bidirectional SAC significantly outperforms standard SAC and other baselines, achieving up to a $30\%$ increase in episodic rewards, alongside enhanced sample efficiency.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE), an ensemble of specialized models equipped with a router that dynamically distributes each input to appropriate experts, has achieved successful results in the field of machine learning. However, theoretical understanding of this architecture is falling behind due to its inherent complexity. In this paper, we theoretically study the sample and runtime complexity of MoE following the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when learning a regression task with an underlying cluster structure of single index models. On the one hand, we prove that a vanilla neural network fails in detecting such a latent organization as it can only process the problem as a whole. This is intrinsically related to the concept of information exponent which is low for each cluster, but increases when we consider the entire task. On the other hand, we show that a MoE succeeds in dividing this problem into easier subproblems by leveraging the ability of each expert to weakly recover the simpler function corresponding to an individual cluster. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to explore the benefits of the MoE framework by examining its SGD dynamics in the context of nonlinear regression.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical applications requires safety guarantees. Provably safe reinforcement learning is an active field of research which aims to provide such guarantees using safeguards. These safeguards should be integrated during training to prevent a large sim-to-real gap. While there are several approaches for safeguarding sampling-based reinforcement learning, analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning often achieves superior performance and sample efficiency. However, there is no safeguarding approach for this learning paradigm yet. Our work addresses this gap by developing the first effective safeguard for analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning. We analyse existing, differentiable safeguards, adapt them through modified mappings and gradient formulations, and integrate them with a state-of-the-art learning algorithm and a differentiable simulation. We evaluate how different safeguards affect policy optimisation using numerical experiments on two classical control tasks. The results demonstrate safeguarded training without compromising performance.

Abstract: With the advancement of diffusion models, there is a growing demand for high-quality, controllable image generation, particularly through methods that utilize one or multiple control signals based on ControlNet. However, in current ControlNet training, each control is designed to influence all areas of an image, which can lead to conflicts when different control signals are expected to manage different parts of the image in practical applications. This issue is especially pronounced with edge-type control conditions, where regions lacking boundary information often represent low-frequency signals, referred to as silent control signals. When combining multiple ControlNets, these silent control signals can suppress the generation of textures in related areas, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this problem, we propose Minimal Impact ControlNet. Our approach mitigates conflicts through three key strategies: constructing a balanced dataset, combining and injecting feature signals in a balanced manner, and addressing the asymmetry in the score function's Jacobian matrix induced by ControlNet. These improvements enhance the compatibility of control signals, allowing for freer and more harmonious generation in areas with silent control signals.

<title>When Lower-Order Terms Dominate: Adaptive Expert Algorithms for Heavy-Tailed Losses</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem setting of prediction with expert advice with possibly heavy-tailed losses, i.e.\ the only assumption on the losses is an upper bound on their second moments, denoted by $\theta$. We develop adaptive algorithms that do not require any prior knowledge about the range or the second moment of the losses. Existing adaptive algorithms have what is typically considered a lower-order term in their regret guarantees. We show that this lower-order term, which is often the maximum of the losses, can actually dominate the regret bound in our setting. Specifically, we show that even with small constant $\theta$, this lower-order term can scale as $\sqrt{KT}$, where $K$ is the number of experts and $T$ is the time horizon. We propose adaptive algorithms with improved regret bounds that avoid the dependence on such a lower-order term and guarantee $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\theta T\log(K)})$ regret in the worst case, and $\mathcal{O}(\theta \log(KT)/\Delta_{\min})$ regret when the losses are sampled i.i.d.\ from some fixed distribution, where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the difference between the mean losses of the second best expert and the best expert. Additionally, when the loss function is the squared loss, our algorithm also guarantees improved regret bounds over prior results.

Abstract: Linear and quadratic optimization are crucial in numerous real-world applications, from training machine learning models to integer-linear optimization. Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, requiring solving many such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive learning, thereby pretraining MPNNs for enhanced performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.

Abstract: The problem of identifying geometric structure in data is a cornerstone of (unsupervised) learning. As a result, Geometric Representation Learning has been widely applied across scientific and engineering domains. In this work, we investigate the use of Geometric Representation Learning for the data-driven discovery of system dynamics from spatial-temporal data. We propose to encode similarity structure in such data in a spatial-temporal proximity graph, to which we apply a range of classical and deep learning-based manifold learning approaches to learn reduced order dynamics. We observe that while manifold learning is generally capable of recovering reduced order dynamics, the quality of the learned representations varies substantially across different algorithms and hyperparameter choices. This is indicative of high sensitivity to the inherent geometric assumptions of the respective approaches and suggests a need for careful hyperparameter tuning, which can be expensive in practise. To overcome these challenges, we propose a framework for Automated Manifold Learning, which selects a manifold learning approach and corresponding hyperparameter choices based on representative subsamples of the input graph. We demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to performance gains both in scalability and in the learned representations' accuracy in capturing local and global geometric features of the underlying system dynamics.

Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) enables clients to remove the influence of specific data from a collaboratively trained shared global model, addressing regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA. However, this unlearning process introduces a new privacy risk: A malicious server may exploit unlearning updates to reconstruct the data requested for removal, a form of Data Reconstruction Attack (DRA). While DRAs for machine unlearning have been studied extensively in centralized Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) settings, their applicability to FU remains unclear due to the decentralized, client-driven nature of FU. This work presents DRAUN, the first attack framework to reconstruct unlearned data in FU systems. DRAUN targets optimization-based unlearning methods, which are widely adopted for their efficiency. We theoretically demonstrate why existing DRAs targeting machine unlearning in MLaaS fail in FU and show how DRAUN overcomes these limitations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on four datasets and four model architectures, evaluating its performance against five popular unlearning methods, effectively demonstrating that state-of-the-art FU methods remain vulnerable to DRAs.

Abstract: This paper introduces FedGenGMM, a novel one-shot federated learning approach for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) tailored for unsupervised learning scenarios. In federated learning (FL), where multiple decentralized clients collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, significant challenges include statistical heterogeneity, high communication costs, and privacy concerns. FedGenGMM addresses these issues by allowing local GMM models, trained independently on client devices, to be aggregated through a single communication round. This approach leverages the generative property of GMMs, enabling the creation of a synthetic dataset on the server side to train a global model efficiently. Evaluation across diverse datasets covering image, tabular, and time series data demonstrates that FedGenGMM consistently achieves performance comparable to non-federated and iterative federated methods, even under significant data heterogeneity. Additionally, FedGenGMM significantly reduces communication overhead, maintains robust performance in anomaly detection tasks, and offers flexibility in local model complexities, making it particularly suitable for edge computing environments.

<title>Enhancing Customer Service Chatbots with Context-Aware NLU through Selective Attention and Multi-task Learning</title>

Abstract: Customer service chatbots are conversational systems aimed at addressing customer queries, often by directing them to automated workflows. A crucial aspect of this process is the classification of the customer's intent. Presently, most intent classification models for customer care utilise only customer query for intent prediction. This may result in low-accuracy models, which cannot handle ambiguous queries. An ambiguous query like "I didn't receive my package" could indicate a delayed order, or an order that was delivered but the customer failed to receive it. Resolution of each of these scenarios requires the execution of very different sequence of steps. Utilizing additional information, such as the customer's order delivery status, in the right manner can help identify the intent for such ambiguous queries. In this paper, we have introduced a context-aware NLU model that incorporates both, the customer query and contextual information from the customer's order status for predicting customer intent. A novel selective attention module is used to extract relevant context features. We have also proposed a multi-task learning paradigm for the effective utilization of different label types available in our training data. Our suggested method, Multi-Task Learning Contextual NLU with Selective Attention Weighted Context (MTL-CNLU-SAWC), yields a 4.8% increase in top 2 accuracy score over the baseline model which only uses user queries, and a 3.5% improvement over existing state-of-the-art models that combine query and context. We have deployed our model to production for Walmart's customer care domain. Accurate intent prediction through MTL-CNLU-SAWC helps to better direct customers to automated workflows, thereby significantly reducing escalations to human agents, leading to almost a million dollars in yearly savings for the company.

Abstract: High-quality datasets are fundamental to training and evaluating machine learning models, yet their creation-especially with accurate human annotations-remains a significant challenge. Many dataset paper submissions lack originality, diversity, or rigorous quality control, and these shortcomings are often overlooked during peer review. Submissions also frequently omit essential details about dataset construction and properties. While existing tools such as datasheets aim to promote transparency, they are largely descriptive and do not provide standardized, measurable methods for evaluating data quality. Similarly, metadata requirements at conferences promote accountability but are inconsistently enforced. To address these limitations, this position paper advocates for the integration of systematic, rubric-based evaluation metrics into the dataset review process-particularly as submission volumes continue to grow. We also explore scalable, cost-effective methods for synthetic data generation, including dedicated tools and LLM-as-a-judge approaches, to support more efficient evaluation. As a call to action, we introduce DataRubrics, a structured framework for assessing the quality of both human- and model-generated datasets. Leveraging recent advances in LLM-based evaluation, DataRubrics offers a reproducible, scalable, and actionable solution for dataset quality assessment, enabling both authors and reviewers to uphold higher standards in data-centric research. We also release code to support reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations at https://github.com/datarubrics/datarubrics.

Abstract: We study how training data contributes to the emergence of toxic behaviors in large-language models. Most prior work on reducing model toxicity adopts $reactive$ approaches, such as fine-tuning pre-trained (and potentially toxic) models to align them with human values. In contrast, we propose a $proactive$ approach$-$IF-Guide$-$which leverages influence functions to identify harmful tokens within any training data and suppress their impact during training. To this end, we first show that standard influence functions are ineffective at discovering harmful training records. We then present a novel adaptation that measures token-level attributions from training data to model toxicity, along with techniques for selecting toxic training documents and a learning objective that can be integrated into both pre-training and fine-tuning. Moreover, IF-Guide does not rely on human-preference data, which is typically required by existing alignment methods. In evaluation, we demonstrate that IF-Guide substantially reduces both explicit and implicit toxicity$-$by up to 10$\times$ compared to uncensored models, and up to 3$\times$ compared to baseline alignment methods, e.g., DPO and RAD$-$across both pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios. IF-Guide is computationally efficient: a billion-parameter model is $not$ $necessary$ for computing influence scores; a million-parameter model$-$with 7.5$\times$ fewer parameters$-$can effectively serve as a proxy for identifying harmful data.

<title>Efficient Learning of Balanced Signed Graphs via Sparse Linear Programming</title>

Abstract: Signed graphs are equipped with both positive and negative edge weights, encoding pairwise correlations as well as anti-correlations in data. A balanced signed graph is a signed graph with no cycles containing an odd number of negative edges. Laplacian of a balanced signed graph has eigenvectors that map via a simple linear transform to ones in a corresponding positive graph Laplacian, thus enabling reuse of spectral filtering tools designed for positive graphs. We propose an efficient method to learn a balanced signed graph Laplacian directly from data. Specifically, extending a previous linear programming (LP) based sparse inverse covariance estimation method called CLIME, we formulate a new LP problem for each Laplacian column $i$, where the linear constraints restrict weight signs of edges stemming from node $i$, so that nodes of same / different polarities are connected by positive / negative edges. Towards optimal model selection, we derive a suitable CLIME parameter $\rho$ based on a combination of the Hannan-Quinn information criterion and a minimum feasibility criterion. We solve the LP problem efficiently by tailoring a sparse LP method based on ADMM. We theoretically prove local solution convergence of our proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our balanced graph learning method outperforms competing methods and enables reuse of spectral filters, wavelets, and graph convolutional nets (GCN) constructed for positive graphs.

Abstract: As machine learning algorithms are shown to be an increasingly valuable tool, the demand for their access has grown accordingly. Oftentimes, it is infeasible to run inference with larger models without an accelerator, which may be unavailable in environments that have constraints such as energy consumption, security, or cost. To increase the availability of these models, we aim to im- prove the LLM inference speed on a CPU-only environment by modifying the cache architecture. To determine what improvements could be made, we conducted two experiments using Llama.cpp and the QWEN model: running various cache configurations and evaluating their performance, and outputting a trace of the memory footprint. Using these experiments, we investigate the memory access patterns and performance characteristics to identify potential optimizations.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of unsupervised pre-training paradigms, researchers have applied these approaches to DNA pre-training. However, we argue that these approaches alone yield suboptimal results because pure DNA sequences lack sufficient information, since their functions are regulated by genomic profiles like chromatin accessibility. Here, we demonstrate that supervised training for genomic profile prediction serves as a more effective alternative to pure sequence pre-training. Furthermore, considering the multi-species and multi-profile nature of genomic profile prediction, we introduce our $\textbf{S}$pecies-$\textbf{P}$rofile $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{C}$ollaborative $\textbf{E}$xperts (SPACE) that leverages Mixture of Experts (MoE) to better capture the relationships between DNA sequences across different species and genomic profiles, thereby learning more effective DNA representations. Through extensive experiments across various tasks, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing that DNA models trained with supervised genomic profiles serve as powerful DNA representation learners. The code is available at https://github.com/ZhuJiwei111/SPACE.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets encode rich visual and linguistic knowledge, making them a strong foundation for robotics. Rather than training robotic policies from scratch, recent approaches adapt VLMs into vision-language-action (VLA) models that enable natural language-driven perception and control. However, existing VLAs are typically massive--often with billions of parameters--leading to high training costs and limited real-world deployability. Moreover, they rely on academic and industrial datasets, overlooking the growing availability of community-collected data from affordable robotic platforms. In this work, we present SmolVLA, a small, efficient, and community-driven VLA that drastically reduces both training and inference costs, while retaining competitive performance. SmolVLA is designed to be trained on a single GPU and deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or even CPUs. To further improve responsiveness, we introduce an asynchronous inference stack decoupling perception and action prediction from action execution, allowing higher control rates with chunked action generation. Despite its compact size, SmolVLA achieves performance comparable to VLAs that are 10x larger. We evaluate SmolVLA on a range of both simulated as well as real-world robotic benchmarks and release all code, pretrained models, and training data.

Abstract: This competition hosted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/trojan-horse-hunt-in-space) is the first part of a series of follow-up competitions and hackathons related to the "Assurance for Space Domain AI Applications" project funded by the European Space Agency (https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/). The competition idea is based on one of the real-life AI security threats identified within the project -- the adversarial poisoning of continuously fine-tuned satellite telemetry forecasting models. The task is to develop methods for finding and reconstructing triggers (trojans) in advanced models for satellite telemetry forecasting used in safety-critical space operations. Participants are provided with 1) a large public dataset of real-life multivariate satellite telemetry (without triggers), 2) a reference model trained on the clean data, 3) a set of poisoned neural hierarchical interpolation (N-HiTS) models for time series forecasting trained on the dataset with injected triggers, and 4) Jupyter notebook with the training pipeline and baseline algorithm (the latter will be published in the last month of the competition). The main task of the competition is to reconstruct a set of 45 triggers (i.e., short multivariate time series segments) injected into the training data of the corresponding set of 45 poisoned models. The exact characteristics (i.e., shape, amplitude, and duration) of these triggers must be identified by participants. The popular Neural Cleanse method is adopted as a baseline, but it is not designed for time series analysis and new approaches are necessary for the task. The impact of the competition is not limited to the space domain, but also to many other safety-critical applications of advanced time series analysis where model poisoning may lead to serious consequences.

<title>Trade-offs in Data Memorization via Strong Data Processing Inequalities</title>

Abstract: Recent research demonstrated that training large language models involves memorization of a significant fraction of training data. Such memorization can lead to privacy violations when training on sensitive user data and thus motivates the study of data memorization's role in learning. In this work, we develop a general approach for proving lower bounds on excess data memorization, that relies on a new connection between strong data processing inequalities and data memorization. We then demonstrate that several simple and natural binary classification problems exhibit a trade-off between the number of samples available to a learning algorithm, and the amount of information about the training data that a learning algorithm needs to memorize to be accurate. In particular, $\Omega(d)$ bits of information about the training data need to be memorized when $O(1)$ $d$-dimensional examples are available, which then decays as the number of examples grows at a problem-specific rate. Further, our lower bounds are generally matched (up to logarithmic factors) by simple learning algorithms. We also extend our lower bounds to more general mixture-of-clusters models. Our definitions and results build on the work of Brown et al. (2021) and address several limitations of the lower bounds in their work.

<title>Unified Scaling Laws for Compressed Representations</title>

Abstract: Scaling laws have shaped recent advances in machine learning by enabling predictable scaling of model performance based on model size, computation, and data volume. Concurrently, the rise in computational cost for AI has motivated model compression techniques, notably quantization and sparsification, which have emerged to mitigate the steep computational demands associated with large-scale training and inference. This paper investigates the interplay between scaling laws and compression formats, exploring whether a unified scaling framework can accurately predict model performance when training occurs over various compressed representations, such as sparse, scalar-quantized, sparse-quantized or even vector-quantized formats. Our key contributions include validating a general scaling law formulation and showing that it is applicable both individually but also composably across compression types. Based on this, our main finding is demonstrating both theoretically and empirically that there exists a simple "capacity" metric -- based on the representation's ability to fit random Gaussian data -- which can robustly predict parameter efficiency across multiple compressed representations. On the practical side, we extend our formulation to directly compare the accuracy potential of different compressed formats, and to derive better algorithms for training over sparse-quantized formats.

Abstract: As a machine-learned potential, the neuroevolution potential (NEP) method features exceptional computational efficiency and has been successfully applied in materials science. Constructing high-quality training datasets is crucial for developing accurate NEP models. However, the preparation and screening of NEP training datasets remain a bottleneck for broader applications due to their time-consuming, labor-intensive, and resource-intensive nature. In this work, we have developed NepTrain and NepTrainKit, which are dedicated to initializing and managing training datasets to generate high-quality training sets while automating NEP model training. NepTrain is an open-source Python package that features a bond length filtering method to effectively identify and remove non-physical structures from molecular dynamics trajectories, thereby ensuring high-quality training datasets. NepTrainKit is a graphical user interface (GUI) software designed specifically for NEP training datasets, providing functionalities for data editing, visualization, and interactive exploration. It integrates key features such as outlier identification, farthest-point sampling, non-physical structure detection, and configuration type selection. The combination of these tools enables users to process datasets more efficiently and conveniently. Using $\rm CsPbI_3$ as a case study, we demonstrate the complete workflow for training NEP models with NepTrain and further validate the models through materials property predictions. We believe this toolkit will greatly benefit researchers working with machine learning interatomic potentials.

Abstract: Frugal Machine Learning (FML) refers to the practice of designing Machine Learning (ML) models that are efficient, cost-effective, and mindful of resource constraints. This field aims to achieve acceptable performance while minimizing the use of computational resources, time, energy, and data for both training and inference. FML strategies can be broadly categorized into input frugality, learning process frugality, and model frugality, each focusing on reducing resource consumption at different stages of the ML pipeline. This chapter explores recent advancements, applications, and open challenges in FML, emphasizing its importance for smart environments that incorporate edge computing and IoT devices, which often face strict limitations in bandwidth, energy, or latency. Technological enablers such as model compression, energy-efficient hardware, and data-efficient learning techniques are discussed, along with adaptive methods including parameter regularization, knowledge distillation, and dynamic architecture design that enable incremental model updates without full retraining. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive taxonomy of frugal methods, discusses case studies across diverse domains, and identifies future research directions to drive innovation in this evolving field.

<title>Learning to Explore: An In-Context Learning Approach for Pure Exploration</title>

arXiv:2506.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the active sequential hypothesis testing problem, also known as pure exploration, where the goal is to actively control a data collection process to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis underlying a decision problem. While relevant across multiple domains, devising adaptive exploration strategies remains challenging, particularly due to difficulties in encoding appropriate inductive biases. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods often underperform when relevant information structures are inadequately represented, whereas more complex methods, like Best Arm Identification (BAI) techniques, may be difficult to devise and typically rely on explicit modeling assumptions. To address these limitations, we introduce In-Context Pure Exploration (ICPE), an in-context learning approach that uses Transformers to learn exploration strategies directly from experience. ICPE combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to identify and exploit latent structure across related tasks, without requiring prior assumptions. Numerical results across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks highlight ICPE's capability to achieve robust performance performance in deterministic, stochastic, and structured settings. These results demonstrate ICPE's ability to match optimal instance-dependent algorithms using only deep learning techniques, making it a practical and general approach to data-efficient exploration.

Abstract: Modern single-cell datasets now comprise hundreds of millions of cells, presenting significant challenges for training deep learning models that require shuffled, memory-efficient data loading. While the AnnData format is the community standard for storing single-cell datasets, existing data loading solutions for AnnData are often inadequate: some require loading all data into memory, others convert to dense formats that increase storage demands, and many are hampered by slow random disk access. We present scDataset, a PyTorch IterableDataset that operates directly on one or more AnnData files without the need for format conversion. The core innovation is a combination of block sampling and batched fetching, which together balance randomness and I/O efficiency. On the Tahoe 100M dataset, scDataset achieves up to a 48$\times$ speed-up over AnnLoader, a 27$\times$ speed-up over HuggingFace Datasets, and an 18$\times$ speed-up over BioNeMo in single-core settings. These advances democratize large-scale single-cell model training for the broader research community.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated tremendous empirical success across numerous challenging domains. However, we lack a strong theoretical understanding of the statistical complexity of RL in environments with large state spaces, where function approximation is required for sample-efficient learning. This thesis addresses this gap by rigorously examining the statistical complexity of RL with function approximation from a learning theoretic perspective. Departing from a long history of prior work, we consider the weakest form of function approximation, called agnostic policy learning, in which the learner seeks to find the best policy in a given class $\Pi$, with no guarantee that $\Pi$ contains an optimal policy for the underlying task.
  We systematically explore agnostic policy learning along three key axes: environment access -- how a learner collects data from the environment; coverage conditions -- intrinsic properties of the underlying MDP measuring the expansiveness of state-occupancy measures for policies in the class $\Pi$, and representational conditions -- structural assumptions on the class $\Pi$ itself. Within this comprehensive framework, we (1) design new learning algorithms with theoretical guarantees and (2) characterize fundamental performance bounds of any algorithm. Our results reveal significant statistical separations that highlight the power and limitations of agnostic policy learning.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is critical for enabling timely clinical intervention and improving patient outcomes. In this work, we introduce CogniAlign, a multimodal architecture for Alzheimer's detection that integrates audio and textual modalities, two non-intrusive sources of information that offer complementary insights into cognitive health. Unlike prior approaches that fuse modalities at a coarse level, CogniAlign leverages a word-level temporal alignment strategy that synchronizes audio embeddings with corresponding textual tokens based on transcription timestamps. This alignment supports the development of token-level fusion techniques, enabling more precise cross-modal interactions. To fully exploit this alignment, we propose a Gated Cross-Attention Fusion mechanism, where audio features attend over textual representations, guided by the superior unimodal performance of the text modality. In addition, we incorporate prosodic cues, specifically interword pauses, by inserting pause tokens into the text and generating audio embeddings for silent intervals, further enriching both streams. We evaluate CogniAlign on the ADReSSo dataset, where it achieves an accuracy of 90.36%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. A detailed ablation study confirms the advantages of our alignment strategy, attention-based fusion, and prosodic modeling.

arXiv:2506.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing size of large language models (LLMs), full-parameter fine-tuning imposes substantial memory demands. To alleviate this, we propose a novel memory-efficient training paradigm called Momentum Low-rank compression (MLorc). By directly compressing and reconstructing momentum rather than gradients, MLorc avoids imposing a fixed-rank constraint on weight update matrices and better preserves the training dynamics of full-parameter fine-tuning, in contrast to existing low-rank approaches such as LoRA and GaLore. Empirically, MLorc consistently outperforms other memory-efficient training methods, matches or even exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning with a small rank (e.g., $r=4$), and generalizes well across different optimizers -- all while not compromising time or memory efficiency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for its convergence under reasonable assumptions.

arXiv:2506.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving data publication, including synthetic data sharing, often experiences trade-offs between privacy and utility. Synthetic data is generally more effective than data anonymization in balancing this trade-off, however, not without its own challenges. Synthetic data produced by generative models trained on source data may inadvertently reveal information about outliers. Techniques specifically designed for preserving privacy, such as introducing noise to satisfy differential privacy, often incur unpredictable and significant losses in utility. In this work we show that, with the right mechanism of synthetic data generation, we can achieve strong privacy protection without significant utility loss. Synthetic data generators producing contracting data patterns, such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), can enhance a differentially private data generator, leveraging the strengths of both. We prove in theory and through empirical demonstration that this SMOTE-DP technique can produce synthetic data that not only ensures robust privacy protection but maintains utility in downstream learning tasks.

Abstract: This work introduces a hybrid non-Euclidean optimization method which generalizes gradient norm clipping by combining steepest descent and conditional gradient approaches. The method achieves the best of both worlds by establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of ($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms for deep learning and demonstrate their properties on image classification and language modeling.

Abstract: Transformer based models have shown remarkable capabilities in sequence learning across a wide range of tasks, often performing well on specific task by leveraging input-output examples. Despite their empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this work, we investigate the layerwise behavior of Transformers to uncover the mechanisms underlying their multi-task generalization ability. Taking explorations on a typical sequence model, i.e, Hidden Markov Models, which are fundamental to many language tasks, we observe that: first, lower layers of Transformers focus on extracting feature representations, primarily influenced by neighboring tokens; second, on the upper layers, features become decoupled, exhibiting a high degree of time disentanglement. Building on these empirical insights, we provide theoretical analysis for the expressiveness power of Transformers. Our explicit constructions align closely with empirical observations, providing theoretical support for the Transformer's effectiveness and efficiency on sequence learning across diverse tasks.

Abstract: In this study, we compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum neural networks (NNs) as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of binary image classification. We use two distinct methodologies: using randomized NNs on dimensionality-reduced data, and applying CNNs to full image data. We evaluate these approaches on three data sets of increasing complexity: an artificial hypercube dataset, MNIST handwritten digits and real-world industrial images. We analyze correlations between classification accuracy and quantum model hyperparameters, including the number of trainable parameters, feature encoding methods, circuit layers, entangling gate type and structure, gate entangling power, and measurement operators. For random quantum NNs, we compare their performance against literature models. Classical and quantum/hybrid models achieved statistically equivalent classification accuracies across most datasets, with no approach demonstrating consistent superiority. We observe that quantum models show lower variance with respect to initial training parameters, suggesting better training stability. Among the hyperparameters analyzed, only the number of trainable parameters showed a positive correlation with the model performance. Around 94% of the best-performing quantum NNs had entangling gates, although for hybrid CNNs, models without entanglement performed equally well but took longer to converge. Cross-dataset performance analysis revealed limited transferability of quantum models between different classification tasks. Our study provides an industry perspective on quantum machine learning for practical image classification tasks, highlighting both current limitations and potential avenues for further research in quantum circuit design, entanglement utilization, and model transferability across varied applications.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the adoption of AI techniques to enhance electronic design automation. In particular, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in LLM-assisted hardware design generation, spanning applications from classical digital circuits to quantum computing. Despite substantial progress in this direction, the quality of LLM-generated hardware design still cannot meet the requirements for practical deployment. In this work, we identify three critical challenges hindering the development of LLM-assisted hardware design generation: 1) limited data availability, 2) varied data quality, 3) inadequate inference-time efficiency. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces a two-stage framework for AI-assisted hardware design by exploring decentralized training and personalized inference. In the first stage, we propose to harness private domain design sources through a hierarchical decentralized training mechanism that addresses data-sharing constraints. To mitigate the impact of low-quality data, we identify optimization opportunities in hardware generation tasks, using user-defined metrics for model aggregation. The second stage focuses on client personalization to enhance both speed and quality. We introduce a new metric, Trueput, to analyze LLM-assisted hardware generation efficiency. To optimize Trueput, we implement personalized inference-time acceleration and customized sampling strategies. Evaluating both classical and quantum benchmarks, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage framework can significantly improve the model capability for hardware design generation. As orthogonal enhancements to existing methods, our framework can achieve $33\% \sim 50\%$ semantic accuracy improvement and $2.3$ times speedup, depending on the difficulty of the generation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large-language models (LLMs) is driving a new wave of specialized hardware for inference. This paper presents the first workload-centric, cross-architectural performance study of commercial AI accelerators, spanning GPU-based chips, hybrid packages, and wafer-scale engines. We compare memory hierarchies, compute fabrics, and on-chip interconnects, and observe up to 3.7x performance variation across architectures as batch size and sequence length change. Four scaling techniques for trillion-parameter models are examined; expert parallelism offers an 8.4x parameter-to-compute advantage but incurs 2.1x higher latency variance than tensor parallelism. These findings provide quantitative guidance for matching workloads to accelerators and reveal architectural gaps that next-generation designs must address.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile, physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue. Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the field of physics.

Abstract: The large underlying assumption of climate models today relies on the basis of a "confident" initial condition, a reasonably plausible snapshot of the Earth for which all future predictions depend on. However, given the inherently chaotic nature of our system, this assumption is complicated by sensitive dependence, where small uncertainties in initial conditions can lead to exponentially diverging outcomes over time. This challenge is particularly salient at global spatial scales and over centennial timescales, where data gaps are not just common but expected. The source of uncertainty is two-fold: (1) sparse, noisy observations from satellites and ground stations, and (2) internal variability stemming from the simplifying approximations within the models themselves.
  In practice, data assimilation methods are used to reconcile this missing information by conditioning model states on partial observations. Our work builds on this idea but operates at the extreme end of sparsity. We propose a conditional data imputation framework that reconstructs full temperature fields from as little as 1% observational coverage. The method leverages a diffusion model guided by a prekriged mask, effectively inferring the full-state fields from minimal data points. We validate our framework over the Southern Great Plains, focusing on afternoon (12:00-6:00 PM) temperature fields during the summer months of 2018-2020. Across varying observational densities--from swath data to isolated in-situ sensors--our model achieves strong reconstruction accuracy, highlighting its potential to fill in critical data gaps in both historical reanalysis and real-time forecasting pipelines.

Abstract: Text embedding models enable semantic search, powering several NLP applications like Retrieval Augmented Generation by efficient information retrieval (IR). However, text embedding models are commonly studied in scenarios where the training data is static, thus limiting its applications to dynamic scenarios where new training data emerges over time. IR methods generally encode a huge corpus of documents to low-dimensional embeddings and store them in a database index. During retrieval, a semantic search over the corpus is performed and the document whose embedding is most similar to the query embedding is returned. When updating an embedding model with new training data, using the already indexed corpus is suboptimal due to the non-compatibility issue, since the model which was used to obtain the embeddings of the corpus has changed. While re-indexing of old corpus documents using the updated model enables compatibility, it requires much higher computation and time. Thus, it is critical to study how the already indexed corpus can still be effectively used without the need of re-indexing. In this work, we establish a continual learning benchmark with large-scale datasets and continually train dense retrieval embedding models on query-document pairs from new datasets in each task and observe forgetting on old tasks due to significant drift of embeddings. We employ embedding distillation on both query and document embeddings to maintain stability and propose a novel query drift compensation method during retrieval to project new model query embeddings to the old embedding space. This enables compatibility with previously indexed corpus embeddings extracted using the old model and thus reduces the forgetting. We show that the proposed method significantly improves performance without any re-indexing. Code is available at https://github.com/dipamgoswami/QDC.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) models suffer from a lack of interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel interpretability framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose previously uninterpretable dense embeddings from DPR models into distinct, interpretable latent concepts. We generate natural language descriptions for each latent concept, enabling human interpretations of both the dense embeddings and the query-document similarity scores of DPR models. We further introduce Concept-Level Sparse Retrieval (CL-SR), a retrieval framework that directly utilizes the extracted latent concepts as indexing units. CL-SR effectively combines the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the transparency and efficiency of sparse representations. We show that CL-SR achieves high index-space and computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance across vocabulary and semantic mismatches.

Abstract: The growing importance of intraday electricity trading in Europe calls for improved price forecasting and tailored decision-support tools. In this paper, we propose a novel generative neural network model to generate probabilistic path forecasts for intraday electricity prices and use them to construct effective trading strategies for Germany's continuous-time intraday market. Our method demonstrates competitive performance in terms of statistical evaluation metrics compared to two state-of-the-art statistical benchmark approaches. To further assess its economic value, we consider a realistic fixed-volume trading scenario and propose various strategies for placing market sell orders based on the path forecasts. Among the different trading strategies, the price paths generated by our generative model lead to higher profit gains than the benchmark methods. Our findings highlight the potential of generative machine learning tools in electricity price forecasting and underscore the importance of economic evaluation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for recommendation systems, but they often struggle under data sparsity and noise. To address these issues, we implemented LightGCL, a graph contrastive learning model that uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for robust graph augmentation, preserving semantic integrity without relying on stochastic or heuristic perturbations. LightGCL enables structural refinement and captures global collaborative signals, achieving significant gains over state-of-the-art models across benchmark datasets. Our experiments also demonstrate improved fairness and resilience to popularity bias, making it well-suited for real-world recommender systems.

Abstract: Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations that disrupt normal gene expression, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. High-dimensional microarray datasets pose challenges for classification models due to the "small n, large p" problem, resulting in overfitting. This study makes three different key contributions: 1) we propose a machine learning-based approach integrating the Feature Selection Without Re-placement (FSWOR) technique and a projection method to improve classification accuracy. 2) We apply the Kendall statistical test to identify the most significant genes from the brain cancer mi-croarray dataset (GSE50161), reducing the feature space from 54,675 to 20,890 genes.3) we apply machine learning models using k-fold cross validation techniques in which our model incorpo-rates ensemble classifiers with LDA projection and Na\"ive Bayes, achieving a test score of 96%, outperforming existing methods by 9.09%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-proach in high-dimensional gene expression analysis, improving classification accuracy while mitigating overfitting. This study contributes to cancer biomarker discovery, offering a robust computational method for analyzing microarray data.

Abstract: Educators teaching entry-level university engineering modules face the challenge of identifying which topics students find most difficult and how to support diverse student needs effectively. This study demonstrates a rigorous yet interpretable statistical approach -- hierarchical Bayesian modeling -- that leverages detailed student response data to quantify both skill difficulty and individual student abilities. Using a large-scale dataset from an undergraduate Statics course, we identified clear patterns of skill mastery and uncovered distinct student subgroups based on their learning trajectories. Our analysis reveals that certain concepts consistently present challenges, requiring targeted instructional support, while others are readily mastered and may benefit from enrichment activities. Importantly, the hierarchical Bayesian method provides educators with intuitive, reliable metrics without sacrificing predictive accuracy. This approach allows for data-informed decisions, enabling personalized teaching strategies to improve student engagement and success. By combining robust statistical methods with clear interpretability, this study equips educators with actionable insights to better support diverse learner populations.

<title>SafeCOMM: What about Safety Alignment in Fine-Tuned Telecom Large Language Models?</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for telecom tasks and datasets is a common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However, little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety. Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue for telecom-tuned LLMs using three representative datasets featured by the GenAINet initiative. We show that safety degradation persists even for structured and seemingly harmless datasets such as 3GPP standards and tabular records, indicating that telecom-specific data is not immune to safety erosion during fine-tuning. We further extend our analysis to publicly available Telecom LLMs trained via continual pre-training, revealing that safety alignment is often severely lacking, primarily due to the omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues in both fine-tuned and pre-trained models, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate three safety realignment defenses (SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, and SafeMERGE) using established red-teaming benchmarks. The results show that, across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety after harmful degradation without compromising downstream task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. In a nutshell, our work serves as a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning for real-world deployments of Telecom LLMs.

Abstract: This paper investigates how prompt engineering techniques impact both accuracy and confidence elicitation in Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to medical contexts. Using a stratified dataset of Persian board exam questions across multiple specialties, we evaluated five LLMs - GPT-4o, o3-mini, Llama-3.3-70b, Llama-3.1-8b, and DeepSeek-v3 - across 156 configurations. These configurations varied in temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt styles (Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and confidence scales (1-10, 1-100). We used AUC-ROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to evaluate alignment between confidence and actual performance. Chain-of-Thought prompts improved accuracy but also led to overconfidence, highlighting the need for calibration. Emotional prompting further inflated confidence, risking poor decisions. Smaller models like Llama-3.1-8b underperformed across all metrics, while proprietary models showed higher accuracy but still lacked calibrated confidence. These results suggest prompt engineering must address both accuracy and uncertainty to be effective in high-stakes medical tasks.

Abstract: Television networks face high financial risk when making programming decisions, often relying on limited historical data to forecast episodic viewership. This study introduces a machine learning framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) features from over 25000 television episodes with traditional viewership data to enhance predictive accuracy. By extracting emotional tone, cognitive complexity, and narrative structure from episode dialogue, we evaluate forecasting performance using SARIMAX, rolling XGBoost, and feature selection models. While prior viewership remains a strong baseline predictor, NLP features contribute meaningful improvements for some series. We also introduce a similarity scoring method based on Euclidean distance between aggregate dialogue vectors to compare shows by content. Tested across diverse genres, including Better Call Saul and Abbott Elementary, our framework reveals genre-specific performance and offers interpretable metrics for writers, executives, and marketers seeking data-driven insight into audience behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the ability to match human capabilities and behavior in many settings. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) further allows LLMs to generate diverse output depending on the contents of their RAG database. This motivates their use in the social sciences to study human behavior between individuals when large-scale experiments are infeasible. However, LLMs depend on complex, computationally expensive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce interacting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as an alternative to similar frameworks using LLMs. We compare a simplified model of GMMs to select experimental simulations of LLMs whose updating and response depend on feedback from other LLMs. We find that interacting GMMs capture important features of the dynamics in interacting LLMs, and we investigate key similarities and differences between interacting LLMs and GMMs. We conclude by discussing the benefits of Gaussian mixture models, potential modifications, and future research directions.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes decision-making -- such as allocating scarce resources like donor organs -- raises critical questions about their alignment with human moral values. We systematically evaluate the behavior of several prominent LLMs against human preferences in kidney allocation scenarios and show that LLMs: i) exhibit stark deviations from human values in prioritizing various attributes, and ii) in contrast to humans, LLMs rarely express indecision, opting for deterministic decisions even when alternative indecision mechanisms (e.g., coin flipping) are provided. Nonetheless, we show that low-rank supervised fine-tuning with few samples is often effective in improving both decision consistency and calibrating indecision modeling. These findings illustrate the necessity of explicit alignment strategies for LLMs in moral/ethical domains.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable advancements, yet hallucination, where models produce inaccurate or non-factual statements, remains a significant challenge for real-world deployment. Although current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space. Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is a crucial yet highly complex challenge in humanoid robotics, demanding precise, adaptable, and sample-efficient learning methods. As humanoid robots are usually designed to operate in human-centric environments and interact with everyday objects, mastering dexterous manipulation is critical for real-world deployment. Traditional approaches, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, have made significant strides, but they often struggle due to the unique challenges of real-world dexterous manipulation, including high-dimensional control, limited training data, and covariate shift. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these challenges and reviews existing learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation, spanning imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and hybrid approaches. A promising yet underexplored direction is interactive imitation learning, where human feedback actively refines a robot's behavior during training. While interactive imitation learning has shown success in various robotic tasks, its application to dexterous manipulation remains limited. To address this gap, we examine current interactive imitation learning techniques applied to other robotic tasks and discuss how these methods can be adapted to enhance dexterous manipulation. By synthesizing state-of-the-art research, this paper highlights key challenges, identifies gaps in current methodologies, and outlines potential directions for leveraging interactive imitation learning to improve dexterous robotic skills.

Abstract: Statistical inference in physics is often based on samples from a generator (sometimes referred to as a ``forward model") that emulate experimental data and depend on parameters of the underlying theory. Modern machine learning has supercharged this workflow to enable high-dimensional and unbinned analyses to utilize much more information than ever before. We propose a general framework for describing the integration of machine learning with generators called Generator Based Inference (GBI). A well-studied special case of this setup is Simulation Based Inference (SBI) where the generator is a physics-based simulator. In this work, we examine other methods within the GBI toolkit that use data-driven methods to build the generator. In particular, we focus on resonant anomaly detection, where the generator describing the background is learned from sidebands. We show how to perform machine learning-based parameter estimation in this context with data-derived generators. This transforms the statistical outputs of anomaly detection to be directly interpretable and the performance on the LHCO community benchmark dataset establishes a new state-of-the-art for anomaly detection sensitivity.

<title>Applying Large Language Models to Issue Classification: Revisiting with Extended Data and New Models</title>

Abstract: Effective prioritization of issue reports in software engineering helps to optimize resource allocation and information recovery. However, manual issue classification is laborious and lacks scalability. As an alternative, many open source software (OSS) projects employ automated processes for this task, yet this method often relies on large datasets for adequate training. Traditionally, machine learning techniques have been used for issue classification. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for addressing a range of software engineering challenges, including code and test generation, mapping new requirements to legacy software endpoints, and conducting code reviews. The following research investigates an automated approach to issue classification based on LLMs. By leveraging the capabilities of such models, we aim to develop a robust system for prioritizing issue reports, mitigating the necessity for extensive training data while also maintaining reliability in classification. In our research, we developed an LLM-based approach for accurately labeling issues by selecting two of the most prominent large language models. We then compared their performance across multiple datasets. Our findings show that GPT-4o achieved the best results in classifying issues from the NLBSE 2024 competition. Moreover, GPT-4o outperformed DeepSeek R1, achieving an F1 score 20% higher when both models were trained on the same dataset from the NLBSE 2023 competition, which was ten times larger than the NLBSE 2024 dataset. The fine-tuned GPT-4o model attained an average F1 score of 80.7%, while the fine-tuned DeepSeek R1 model achieved 59.33%. Increasing the dataset size did not improve the F1 score, reducing the dependence on massive datasets for building an efficient solution to issue classification.

We propose Geo-Sign, a method that leverages the properties of hyperbolic geometry to model the hierarchical structure inherent in sign language kinematics. By projecting skeletal features derived from Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCNs) into the Poincar\'e ball model, we aim to create more discriminative embeddings, particularly for fine-grained motions like finger articulations. We introduce a hyperbolic projection layer, a weighted Fr\'echet mean aggregation scheme, and a geometric contrastive loss operating directly in hyperbolic space. These components are integrated into an end-to-end translation framework as a regularisation function, to enhance the representations within the language model. This work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic geometry to improve skeletal representations for Sign Language Translation, improving on SOTA RGB methods while preserving privacy and improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) faces major challenges such as low bandwidth, high latency, mobility, and limited energy resources. Traditional routing protocols like RPL, which were designed for land-based networks, do not perform well in these underwater conditions. This paper introduces RL-RPL-UA, a new routing protocol that uses reinforcement learning to improve performance in underwater environments. Each node includes a lightweight RL agent that selects the best parent node based on local information such as packet delivery ratio, buffer level, link quality, and remaining energy. RL-RPL-UA keeps full compatibility with standard RPL messages and adds a dynamic objective function to support real-time decision-making. Simulations using Aqua-Sim show that RL-RPL-UA increases packet delivery by up to 9.2%, reduces energy use per packet by 14.8%, and extends network lifetime by 80 seconds compared to traditional methods. These results suggest that RL-RPL-UA is a promising and energy-efficient routing solution for underwater networks.

Abstract: Personalization is essential for question answering systems that are user-centric. Despite its importance, personalization in answer generation has been relatively underexplored. This is mainly due to lack of resources for training and evaluating personalized question answering systems. We address this gap by introducing LaMP-QA -- a benchmark designed for evaluating personalized long-form answer generation. The benchmark covers questions from three major categories: (1) Arts & Entertainment, (2) Lifestyle & Personal Development, and (3) Society & Culture, encompassing over 45 subcategories in total. To assess the quality and potential impact of the LaMP-QA benchmark for personalized question answering, we conduct comprehensive human and automatic evaluations, to compare multiple evaluation strategies for evaluating generated personalized responses and measure their alignment with human preferences. Furthermore, we benchmark a number of non-personalized and personalized approaches based on open-source and proprietary large language models (LLMs). Our results show that incorporating the personalized context provided leads to performance improvements of up to 39%. The benchmark is publicly released to support future research in this area.

Abstract: Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in sparse reward and reward-free environments, including class of methods known as intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and thus fail to produce robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in unconstrained, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed to capture robust autonomous exploration observed in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) motivates naturalistic behavior by tracking divergence between the agent's current world model and an ethological prior. We demonstrate that artificial embodied agents trained with 3M-Progress capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously-behaving larval zebrafish, introducing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.

Abstract: Dynamic, risk-based pricing can systematically exclude vulnerable consumer groups from essential resources such as health insurance and consumer credit. We show that a regulator can realign private incentives with social objectives through a learned, interpretable tax schedule. First, we provide a formal proposition that bounding each firm's \emph{local} demographic gap implicitly bounds the \emph{global} opt-out disparity, motivating firm-level penalties. Building on this insight we introduce \texttt{MarketSim} -- an open-source, scalable simulator of heterogeneous consumers and profit-maximizing firms -- and train a reinforcement learning (RL) social planner (SP) that selects a bracketed fairness-tax while remaining close to a simple linear prior via an $\mathcal{L}_1$ regularizer. The learned policy is thus both transparent and easily interpretable. In two empirically calibrated markets, i.e., U.S. health-insurance and consumer-credit, our planner simultaneously raises demand-fairness by up to $16\%$ relative to unregulated Free Market while outperforming a fixed linear schedule in terms of social welfare without explicit coordination. These results illustrate how AI-assisted regulation can convert a competitive social dilemma into a win-win equilibrium, providing a principled and practical framework for fairness-aware market oversight.

Abstract: Randomized dimensionality reduction is a widely-used algorithmic technique for speeding up large-scale Euclidean optimization problems. In this paper, we study dimension reduction for a variety of maximization problems, including max-matching, max-spanning tree, max TSP, as well as various measures for dataset diversity. For these problems, we show that the effect of dimension reduction is intimately tied to the \emph{doubling dimension} $\lambda_X$ of the underlying dataset $X$ -- a quantity measuring intrinsic dimensionality of point sets. Specifically, we prove that a target dimension of $O(\lambda_X)$ suffices to approximately preserve the value of any near-optimal solution,which we also show is necessary for some of these problems. This is in contrast to classical dimension reduction results, whose dependence increases with the dataset size $|X|$. We also provide empirical results validating the quality of solutions found in the projected space, as well as speedups due to dimensionality reduction.

<title>Minimax Rates for the Estimation of Eigenpairs of Weighted Laplace-Beltrami Operators on Manifolds</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating eigenpairs of elliptic differential operators from samples of a distribution $\rho$ supported on a manifold $M$. The operators discussed in the paper are relevant in unsupervised learning and in particular are obtained by taking suitable scaling limits of widely used graph Laplacians over data clouds. We study the minimax risk for this eigenpair estimation problem and explore the rates of approximation that can be achieved by commonly used graph Laplacians built from random data. More concretely, assuming that $\rho$ belongs to a certain family of distributions with controlled second derivatives, and assuming that the $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ where $\rho$ is supported has bounded geometry, we prove that the statistical minimax rate for approximating eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the $H^1(M)$-sense is $n^{-2/(d+4)}$, a rate that matches the minimax rate for a closely related density estimation problem. We then revisit the literature studying Laplacians over proximity graphs in the large data limit and prove that, under slightly stronger regularity assumptions on the data generating model, eigenpairs of graph Laplacians induce manifold agnostic estimators with an error of approximation that, up to logarithmic corrections, matches our lower bounds. Our analysis allows us to expand the existing literature on graph-based learning in at least two significant ways: 1) we consider stronger norms to measure the error of approximation than the ones that had been analyzed in the past; 2) our rates of convergence are uniform over a family of smooth distributions and do not just apply to densities with special symmetries, and, as a consequence of our lower bounds, are essentially sharp when the connectivity of the graph is sufficiently high.

Abstract: The independent chip model (ICM) forms a cornerstone of all modern poker tournament strategy. However, despite its prominence, the ICM's performance in the real world has not been sufficiently scrutinized, especially at a large scale. In this paper, we introduce our new dataset of poker tournaments, consisting of results of over ten thousand events. Then, using this dataset, we perform two experiments as part of a large-scale empirical validation of the ICM. First, we verify that the ICM performs more accurately than a baseline we propose. Second, we obtain empirical evidence of the ICM underestimating the performances of players with larger stacks while overestimating those who are short-stacked. Our contributions may be useful to future researchers developing new algorithms for estimating a player's value in poker tournaments.

<title>Overfitting has a limitation: a model-independent generalization error bound based on R\'enyi entropy</title>

Abstract: Will further scaling up of machine learning models continue to bring success? A significant challenge in answering this question lies in understanding generalization error, which is the impact of overfitting. Understanding generalization error behavior of increasingly large-scale machine learning models remains a significant area of investigation, as conventional analyses often link error bounds to model complexity, failing to fully explain the success of extremely large architectures. This research introduces a novel perspective by establishing a model-independent upper bound for generalization error applicable to algorithms whose outputs are determined solely by the data's histogram, such as empirical risk minimization or gradient-based methods. Crucially, this bound is shown to depend only on the R\'enyi entropy of the data-generating distribution, suggesting that a small generalization error can be maintained even with arbitrarily large models, provided the data quantity is sufficient relative to this entropy. This framework offers a direct explanation for the phenomenon where generalization performance degrades significantly upon injecting random noise into data, where the performance degrade is attributed to the consequent increase in the data distribution's R\'enyi entropy. Furthermore, we adapt the no-free-lunch theorem to be data-distribution-dependent, demonstrating that an amount of data corresponding to the R\'enyi entropy is indeed essential for successful learning, thereby highlighting the tightness of our proposed generalization bound.

Abstract: Transducer models have emerged as a promising choice for end-to-end ASR systems, offering a balanced trade-off between recognition accuracy, streaming capabilities, and inference speed in greedy decoding. However, beam search significantly slows down Transducers due to repeated evaluations of key network components, limiting practical applications. This paper introduces a universal method to accelerate beam search for Transducers, enabling the implementation of two optimized algorithms: ALSD++ and AES++. The proposed method utilizes batch operations, a tree-based hypothesis structure, novel blank scoring for enhanced shallow fusion, and CUDA graph execution for efficient GPU inference. This narrows the speed gap between beam and greedy modes to only 10-20% for the whole system, achieves 14-30% relative improvement in WER compared to greedy decoding, and improves shallow fusion for low-resource up to 11% compared to existing implementations. All the algorithms are open sourced.

<title>Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) excel in modeling complex, multi-typed relationships across diverse domains, yet their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first investigation into the susceptibility of HGNNs to existing graph backdoor attacks, revealing three critical issues: (1) high attack budget required for effective backdoor injection, (2) inefficient and unreliable backdoor activation, and (3) inaccurate attack effectiveness evaluation. To tackle these issues, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack (HGBA), the first backdoor attack specifically designed for HGNNs, introducing a novel relation-based trigger mechanism that establishes specific connections between a strategically selected trigger node and poisoned nodes via the backdoor metapath. HGBA achieves efficient and stealthy backdoor injection with minimal structural modifications and supports easy backdoor activation through two flexible strategies: Self-Node Attack and Indiscriminate Attack. Additionally, we improve the ASR measurement protocol, enabling a more accurate assessment of attack effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGBA far surpasses multiple state-of-the-art graph backdoor attacks in black-box settings, efficiently attacking HGNNs with low attack budgets. Ablation studies show that the strength of HBGA benefits from our trigger node selection method and backdoor metapath selection strategy. In addition, HGBA shows superior robustness against node feature perturbations and multiple types of existing graph backdoor defense mechanisms. Finally, extension experiments demonstrate that the relation-based trigger mechanism can effectively extend to tasks in homogeneous graph scenarios, thereby posing severe threats to broader security-critical domains.

<title>When GPT Spills the Tea: Comprehensive Assessment of Knowledge File Leakage in GPTs</title>

Abstract: Knowledge files have been widely used in large language model (LLM) agents, such as GPTs, to improve response quality. However, concerns about the potential leakage of knowledge files have grown significantly. Existing studies demonstrate that adversarial prompts can induce GPTs to leak knowledge file content. Yet, it remains uncertain whether additional leakage vectors exist, particularly given the complex data flows across clients, servers, and databases in GPTs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive risk assessment of knowledge file leakage, leveraging a novel workflow inspired by Data Security Posture Management (DSPM). Through the analysis of 651,022 GPT metadata, 11,820 flows, and 1,466 responses, we identify five leakage vectors: metadata, GPT initialization, retrieval, sandboxed execution environments, and prompts. These vectors enable adversaries to extract sensitive knowledge file data such as titles, content, types, and sizes. Notably, the activation of the built-in tool Code Interpreter leads to a privilege escalation vulnerability, enabling adversaries to directly download original knowledge files with a 95.95% success rate. Further analysis reveals that 28.80% of leaked files are copyrighted, including digital copies from major publishers and internal materials from a listed company. In the end, we provide actionable solutions for GPT builders and platform providers to secure the GPT data supply chain.

<title>Structuring Radiology Reports: Challenging LLMs with Lightweight Models</title>

Abstract: Radiology reports are critical for clinical decision-making but often lack a standardized format, limiting both human interpretability and machine learning (ML) applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%, GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular solubility is a cornerstone of early-stage drug discovery, yet conventional machine learning models face significant challenges due to limited labeled data and the high-dimensional nature of molecular descriptors. To address these issues, we propose LatMixSol, a novel latent space augmentation framework that combines autoencoder-based feature compression with guided interpolation to enrich training data. Our approach first encodes molecular descriptors into a low-dimensional latent space using a two-layer autoencoder. Spectral clustering is then applied to group chemically similar molecules, enabling targeted MixUp-style interpolation within clusters. Synthetic samples are generated by blending latent vectors of cluster members and decoding them back to the original feature space. Evaluated on the Huuskonen solubility benchmark, LatMixSol demonstrates consistent improvements across three of four gradient-boosted regressors (CatBoost, LightGBM, HistGradientBoosting), achieving RMSE reductions of 3.2-7.6% and R-squared increases of 0.5-1.5%. Notably, HistGradientBoosting shows the most significant enhancement with a 7.6% RMSE improvement. Our analysis confirms that cluster-guided latent space augmentation preserves chemical validity while expanding dataset diversity, offering a computationally efficient strategy to enhance predictive models in resource-constrained drug discovery pipelines.

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that transcends the traditional assumption of data lying in Euclidean space, enabling its application to data on Riemannian manifolds. The primary challenge addressed is the lack of vector space operations on such manifolds. Fletcher et al., in their work {\em Principal Geodesic Analysis for the Study of Nonlinear Statistics of Shape}, proposed Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a geometric approach to analyze data on Riemannian manifolds, particularly effective for structured datasets like medical images, where the manifold's intrinsic structure is apparent. However, PGA's applicability is limited when dealing with general datasets that lack an implicit local distance notion. In this work, we introduce a generalized framework, termed {\em Riemannian Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA)}, to extend PGA for any data endowed with a local distance structure. Specifically, we adapt the PCA methodology to Riemannian manifolds by equipping data tables with local metrics, enabling the incorporation of manifold geometry. This framework provides a unified approach for dimensionality reduction and statistical analysis directly on manifolds, opening new possibilities for datasets with region-specific or part-specific distance notions, ensuring respect for their intrinsic geometric properties.

Abstract: Natural disasters usually affect vast areas and devastate infrastructures. Performing a timely and efficient response is crucial to minimize the impact on affected communities, and data-driven approaches are the best choice. Visual question answering (VQA) models help management teams to achieve in-depth understanding of damages. However, recently published models do not possess the ability to answer open-ended questions and only select the best answer among a predefined list of answers. If we want to ask questions with new additional possible answers that do not exist in the predefined list, the model needs to be fin-tuned/retrained on a new collected and annotated dataset, which is a time-consuming procedure. In recent years, large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have earned significant attention. These models are trained on extensive datasets and demonstrate strong performance on both unimodal and multimodal vision/language downstream tasks, often without the need for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a VLM-based zero-shot VQA (ZeShot-VQA) method, and investigate the performance of on post-disaster FloodNet dataset. Since the proposed method takes advantage of zero-shot learning, it can be applied on new datasets without fine-tuning. In addition, ZeShot-VQA is able to process and generate answers that has been not seen during the training procedure, which demonstrates its flexibility.

Abstract: In the recent years, branch-and-cut algorithms have been the target of data-driven approaches designed to enhance the decision making in different phases of the algorithm such as branching, or the choice of cutting planes (cuts). In particular, for cutting plane selection two score functions have been proposed in the literature to evaluate the quality of a cut: branch-and-cut tree size and gap closed. In this paper, we present new sample complexity lower bounds, valid for both scores. We show that for a wide family of classes $\mathcal{F}$ that maps an instance to a cut, learning over an unknown distribution of the instances to minimize those scores requires at least (up to multiplicative constants) as many samples as learning from the same class function $\mathcal{F}$ any generic target function (using square loss). Our results also extend to the case of learning from a restricted set of cuts, namely those from the Simplex tableau. To the best of our knowledge, these constitute the first lower bounds for the learning-to-cut framework. We compare our bounds to known upper bounds in the case of neural networks and show they are nearly tight. We illustrate our results with a graph neural network selection evaluated on set covering and facility location integer programming models and we empirically show that the gap closed score is an effective proxy to minimize the branch-and-cut tree size. Although the gap closed score has been extensively used in the integer programming literature, this is the first principled analysis discussing both scores at the same time both theoretically and computationally.

Abstract: Varying coefficient models are popular for estimating nonlinear regression functions in functional data models. Their Bayesian variants have received limited attention in large data applications, primarily due to prohibitively slow posterior computations using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We introduce Bayesian data sketching for varying coefficient models to obviate computational challenges presented by large sample sizes. To address the challenges of analyzing large data, we compress the functional response vector and predictor matrix by a random linear transformation to achieve dimension reduction and conduct inference on the compressed data. Our approach distinguishes itself from several existing methods for analyzing large functional data in that it requires neither the development of new models or algorithms, nor any specialized computational hardware while delivering fully model-based Bayesian inference. Well-established methods and algorithms for varying coefficient regression models can be applied to the compressed data.

Abstract: This paper introduces SoundSculpt, a neural network designed to extract target sound fields from ambisonic recordings. SoundSculpt employs an ambisonic-in-ambisonic-out architecture and is conditioned on both spatial information (e.g., target direction obtained by pointing at an immersive video) and semantic embeddings (e.g., derived from image segmentation and captioning). Trained and evaluated on synthetic and real ambisonic mixtures, SoundSculpt demonstrates superior performance compared to various signal processing baselines. Our results further reveal that while spatial conditioning alone can be effective, the combination of spatial and semantic information is beneficial in scenarios where there are secondary sound sources spatially close to the target. Additionally, we compare two different semantic embeddings derived from a text description of the target sound using text encoders.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on the relationship between sleep and cognition, the connection between sleep microstructure and human performance across specific cognitive domains remains underexplored. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict executive functions, particularly cognitive adaptability and conceptual reasoning from physiological processes during a night's sleep. To address this, we introduce CogPSGFormer, a multi-scale convolutional-transformer model designed to process multi-modal polysomnographic data. This model integrates one-channel ECG and EEG signals along with extracted features, including EEG power bands and heart rate variability parameters, to capture complementary information across modalities. A thorough evaluation of the CogPSGFormer architecture was conducted to optimize the processing of extended sleep signals and identify the most effective configuration. The proposed framework was evaluated on 817 individuals from the STAGES dataset using cross-validation. The model achieved 80.3\% accuracy in classifying individuals into low vs. high cognitive performance groups on unseen data based on Penn Conditional Exclusion Test (PCET) scores. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our multi-scale feature extraction and multi-modal learning approach in leveraging sleep-derived signals for cognitive performance prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, our code is publicly accessible (https://github.com/boshrakh95/CogPSGFormer.git).

Abstract: With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) being increasingly used in safety-critical applications, how can an adversary manipulate the scene to cause harm? We introduce CLOAK, the first attack that leverages view-dependent Gaussian appearances - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial content visible only from specific viewpoints. We further demonstrate DAGGER, a targeted adversarial attack directly perturbing 3D Gaussians without access to underlying training data, deceiving multi-stage object detectors e.g., Faster R-CNN, through established methods such as projected gradient descent. These attacks highlight underexplored vulnerabilities in 3DGS, introducing a new potential threat to robotic learning for autonomous navigation and other safety-critical 3DGS applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces DLM-One, a score-distillation-based framework for one-step sequence generation with continuous diffusion language models (DLMs). DLM-One eliminates the need for iterative refinement by aligning the scores of a student model's outputs in the continuous token embedding space with the score function of a pretrained teacher DLM. We investigate whether DLM-One can achieve substantial gains in sampling efficiency for language modeling. Through comprehensive experiments on DiffuSeq -- a representative continuous DLM -- we show that DLM-One achieves up to ~500x speedup in inference time while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark text generation tasks used to evaluate the teacher models. We further analyze the method's empirical behavior across multiple datasets, providing initial insights into its generality and practical applicability. Our findings position one-step diffusion as a promising direction for efficient, high-quality language generation and broader adoption of continuous diffusion models operating in embedding space for natural language processing.

Abstract: Robots with multi-modal locomotion are an active research field due to their versatility in diverse environments. In this context, additional actuation can provide humanoid robots with aerial capabilities. Flying humanoid robots face challenges in modeling and control, particularly with aerodynamic forces. This paper addresses these challenges from a technological and scientific standpoint. The technological contribution includes the mechanical design of iRonCub-Mk1, a jet-powered humanoid robot, optimized for jet engine integration, and hardware modifications for wind tunnel experiments on humanoid robots for precise aerodynamic forces and surface pressure measurements. The scientific contribution offers a comprehensive approach to model and control aerodynamic forces using classical and learning techniques. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations calculate aerodynamic forces, validated through wind tunnel experiments on iRonCub-Mk1. An automated CFD framework expands the aerodynamic dataset, enabling the training of a Deep Neural Network and a linear regression model. These models are integrated into a simulator for designing aerodynamic-aware controllers, validated through flight simulations and balancing experiments on the iRonCub-Mk1 physical prototype.

Abstract: Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\% and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would likely erase the gap entirely.

Abstract: Complexity of Neural Networks is increasing rapidly due to the massive increase in model parameters. Specifically, in Large Language Models (LLMs), the number of model parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years, for example, from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT2 to 175 billion in GPT3. This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices where memory and processing power are very limited. In this work, we investigate reducing LLM complexity with special type of quantization, power of two (PoT), for linear layers weights and transformer tables. PoT not only provides memory reduction but more importantly provides significant computational reduction through converting multiplication to bit shifting. We obtained preliminary results of PoT quantization on Nano-GPT implementation using Shakespeare dataset. We then extended results to 124-M GPT-2 model. The PoT quantization results are shown to be very promising with cross entropy loss degradation $\approx$[1.3-0.88] with number of bits range [4-6] to represent power levels.

<title>Dyna-Think: Synergizing Reasoning, Acting, and World Model Simulation in AI Agents</title>

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification, goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

Abstract: We present the iNaturalist Sounds Dataset (iNatSounds), a collection of 230,000 audio files capturing sounds from over 5,500 species, contributed by more than 27,000 recordists worldwide. The dataset encompasses sounds from birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, and amphibians, with audio and species labels derived from observations submitted to iNaturalist, a global citizen science platform. Each recording in the dataset varies in length and includes a single species annotation. We benchmark multiple backbone architectures, comparing multiclass classification objectives with multilabel objectives. Despite weak labeling, we demonstrate that iNatSounds serves as a useful pretraining resource by benchmarking it on strongly labeled downstream evaluation datasets. The dataset is available as a single, freely accessible archive, promoting accessibility and research in this important domain. We envision models trained on this data powering next-generation public engagement applications, and assisting biologists, ecologists, and land use managers in processing large audio collections, thereby contributing to the understanding of species compositions in diverse soundscapes.

<title>Beyond Winning: Margin of Victory Relative to Expectation Unlocks Accurate Skill Ratings</title>

Abstract: Knowledge of accurate relative skills in any competitive system is essential, but foundational approaches such as ELO discard extremely relevant performance data by concentrating exclusively on binary outcomes. While margin of victory (MOV) extensions exist, they often lack a definitive method for incorporating this information. We introduce Margin of Victory Differential Analysis (MOVDA), a framework that enhances traditional rating systems by using the deviation between the true MOV and a $\textit{modeled expectation}$. MOVDA learns a domain-specific, non-linear function (a scaled hyperbolic tangent that captures saturation effects and home advantage) to predict expected MOV based on rating differentials. Crucially, the $\textit{difference}$ between the true and expected MOV provides a subtle and weighted signal for rating updates, highlighting informative deviations in all levels of contests. Extensive experiments on professional NBA basketball data (from 2013 to 2023, with 13,619 games) show that MOVDA significantly outperforms standard ELO and Bayesian baselines. MOVDA reduces Brier score prediction error by $1.54\%$ compared to TrueSkill, increases outcome accuracy by $0.58\%$, and most importantly accelerates rating convergence by $13.5\%$, while maintaining the computational efficiency of the original ELO updates. MOVDA offers a theoretically motivated, empirically superior, and computationally lean approach to integrating performance magnitude into skill rating for competitive environments like the NBA.

Abstract: While recent audio-visual models have demonstrated impressive performance, their robustness to distributional shifts at test-time remains not fully understood. Existing robustness benchmarks mainly focus on single modalities, making them insufficient for thoroughly assessing the robustness of audio-visual models. Motivated by real-world scenarios where shifts can occur $\textit{simultaneously}$ in both audio and visual modalities, we introduce $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the test-time robustness of audio-visual recognition models. $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ comprises four audio-visual benchmark datasets, $\texttt{AUDIOSET-2C}$, $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$, $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, and $\texttt{EPICKITCHENS-2C}$, each incorporating 75 bimodal audio-visual corruptions that are $\textit{co-occurring}$ and $\textit{correlated}$. Through extensive evaluations, we observe that state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual models exhibit declining robustness as corruption severity increases. Furthermore, online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$ and $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, offer minimal improvements in performance under bimodal corruptions. We further propose $\texttt{AV2C}$, a simple TTA approach enabling on-the-fly cross-modal fusion by penalizing high-entropy samples, which achieves improvements on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$. We hope that $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ will steer the development of more effective and robust audio-visual TTA approaches. Our code is available $\href{https://github.com/sarthaxxxxx/AV-C-Robustness-Benchmark}{here}$.

<title>Label-shift robust federated feature screening for high-dimensional classification</title>

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are important tools for high-dimensional classification of large datasets. To reduce computational costs and overcome the curse of dimensionality, feature screening plays a pivotal role in eliminating irrelevant features during data preprocessing. However, data heterogeneity, particularly label shifting across different clients, presents significant challenges for feature screening. This paper introduces a general framework that unifies existing screening methods and proposes a novel utility, label-shift robust federated feature screening (LR-FFS), along with its federated estimation procedure. The framework facilitates a uniform analysis of methods and systematically characterizes their behaviors under label shift conditions. Building upon this framework, LR-FFS leverages conditional distribution functions and expectations to address label shift without adding computational burdens and remains robust against model misspecification and outliers. Additionally, the federated procedure ensures computational efficiency and privacy protection while maintaining screening effectiveness comparable to centralized processing. We also provide a false discovery rate (FDR) control method for federated feature screening. Experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate LR-FFS's superior performance across diverse client environments, including those with varying class distributions, sample sizes, and missing categorical data.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs have made significant strides in efficiently mapping raw audio waveforms into discrete token representations, which are foundational for contemporary audio generative models. However, most existing codecs are optimized primarily for reconstruction quality, often at the expense of the downstream modelability of the encoded tokens. Motivated by the need to overcome this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{MagiCodec}$, a novel single-layer, streaming Transformer-based audio codec. MagiCodec is designed with a multistage training pipeline that incorporates Gaussian noise injection and latent regularization, explicitly targeting the enhancement of semantic expressiveness in the generated codes while preserving high reconstruction fidelity. We analytically derive the effect of noise injection in the frequency domain, demonstrating its efficacy in attenuating high-frequency components and fostering robust tokenization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that MagiCodec surpasses state-of-the-art codecs in both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks. Notably, the tokens produced by MagiCodec exhibit Zipf-like distributions, as observed in natural languages, thereby improving compatibility with language-model-based generative architectures. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Ereboas/MagiCodec.

<title>Accelerating Diffusion LLMs via Adaptive Parallel Decoding</title>

Abstract: The generation speed of LLMs are bottlenecked by autoregressive decoding, where tokens are predicted sequentially one by one. Alternatively, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion (LWD), a lightweight framework that enables any latent diffusion model to scale to ultra-high-resolution image generation (2K to 4K) for free. LWD introduces three key components: (1) a scale-consistent variational autoencoder objective that enhances the spectral fidelity of latent representations; (2) wavelet energy maps that identify and localize detail-rich spatial regions within the latent space; and (3) a time-dependent masking strategy that focuses denoising supervision on high-frequency components during training. LWD requires no architectural modifications and incurs no additional computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, it consistently improves perceptual quality and reduces FID in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, outperforming strong baseline models. These results highlight the effectiveness of frequency-aware, signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient approach for high-resolution generative modeling.

arXiv:2506.00446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in ranking settings with large ranking action spaces, which stems from an increase in both the number of unique actions and length of the ranking, is essential for assessing new recommender policies using only logged bandit data from previous versions. To address the high variance issues associated with existing estimators, we introduce two new assumptions: no direct effect on rankings and user behavior model on ranking embedding spaces. We then propose the generalized marginalized inverse propensity score (GMIPS) estimator with statistically desirable properties compared to existing ones. Finally, we demonstrate that the GMIPS achieves the lowest MSE. Notably, among GMIPS variants, the marginalized reward interaction IPS (MRIPS) incorporates a doubly marginalized importance weight based on a cascade behavior assumption on ranking embeddings. MRIPS effectively balances the trade-off between bias and variance, even as the ranking action spaces increase and the above assumptions may not hold, as evidenced by our experiments.

Abstract: Long user history is highly valuable signal for recommendation systems, but effectively incorporating it often comes with high cost in terms of data center power consumption and GPU. In this work, we chose offline embedding over end-to-end sequence length optimization methods to enable extremely long user sequence modeling as a cost-effective solution, and propose a new user embedding learning strategy, multi-slicing and summarization, that generates highly generalizable user representation of user's long-term stable interest. History length we encoded in this embedding is up to 70,000 and on average 40,000. This embedding, named as DV365, is proven highly incremental on top of advanced attentive user sequence models deployed in Instagram. Produced by a single upstream foundational model, it is launched in 15 different models across Instagram and Threads with significant impact, and has been production battle-proven for >1 year since our first launch.

Abstract: Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making in environments where olfactory cues are essential. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of robotic olfaction, offering a scalable solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes, making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft, and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue, with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can be tested ``in the wild''. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors, which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at https://github.com/ristea/xmad-bench/.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful framework for seismic wavefield modeling, yet they typically require time-consuming retraining when applied to different velocity models. Moreover, their training can suffer from slow convergence due to the complexity of of the wavefield solution. To address these challenges, we introduce a latent diffusion-based strategy for rapid and effective PINN initialization. First, we train multiple PINNs to represent frequency-domain scattered wavefields for various velocity models, then flatten each trained network's parameters into a one-dimensional vector, creating a comprehensive parameter dataset. Next, we employ an autoencoder to learn latent representations of these parameter vectors, capturing essential patterns across diverse PINN's parameters. We then train a conditional diffusion model to store the distribution of these latent vectors, with the corresponding velocity models serving as conditions. Once trained, this diffusion model can generate latent vectors corresponding to new velocity models, which are subsequently decoded by the autoencoder into complete PINN parameters. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly accelerates training and maintains high accuracy across in-distribution and out-of-distribution velocity scenarios.

While efforts to improve LVLM efficiency are growing, existing methods lack comprehensive evaluation across diverse backbones, benchmarks, and metrics. In this work, we systematically evaluate mainstream acceleration techniques for LVLMs, categorized into token and parameter compression. We introduce EffiVLM-Bench, a unified framework for assessing not only absolute performance but also generalization and loyalty, while exploring Pareto-optimal trade-offs. Our extensive experiments and in-depth analyses offer insights into optimal strategies for accelerating LVLMs. We open-source code and recipes for EffiVLM-Bench to foster future research.

Abstract: Multi-hop questions still stump large language models (LLMs), which struggle to link information across multiple reasoning steps. We introduce Auto-Patch, a novel method that dynamically patches hidden states during inference to enhance multi-hop reasoning in LLMs. Building on the PatchScopes framework, Auto-Patch selectively modifies internal representations using a learned classifier. Evaluated on the MuSiQue dataset, Auto-Patch improves the solve rate from 18.45\% (baseline) to 23.63~$\pm$~0.7\% (3 runs), narrowing the gap to Chain-of-Thought prompting (27.44\%). Our results highlight the potential of dynamic hidden state interventions for advancing complex reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Existing attacks against multimodal language models (MLLMs) primarily communicate instructions through text accompanied by adversarial images. In contrast, we exploit the capabilities of MLLMs to interpret non-textual instructions, specifically, adversarial images or audio generated by our novel method, Con Instruction. We optimize these adversarial examples to align closely with target instructions in the embedding space, revealing the detrimental implications of MLLMs' sophisticated understanding. Unlike prior work, our method does not require training data or preprocessing of textual instructions. While these non-textual adversarial examples can effectively bypass MLLM safety mechanisms, their combination with various text inputs substantially amplifies attack success. We further introduce a new Attack Response Categorization (ARC) framework, which evaluates both the quality of the model's response and its relevance to the malicious instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that Con Instruction effectively bypasses safety mechanisms in multiple vision- and audio-language models, including LLaVA-v1.5, InternVL, Qwen-VL, and Qwen-Audio, evaluated on two standard benchmarks: AdvBench and SafeBench. Specifically, our method achieves the highest attack success rates, reaching 81.3% and 86.6% on LLaVA-v1.5 (13B). On the defense side, we explore various countermeasures against our attacks and uncover a substantial performance gap among existing techniques. Our implementation is made publicly available.

Abstract: Score matching is a vital tool for learning the distribution of data with applications across many areas including diffusion processes, energy based modelling, and graphical model estimation. Despite all these applications, little work explores its use when data is incomplete. We address this by adapting score matching (and its major extensions) to work with missing data in a flexible setting where data can be partially missing over any subset of the coordinates. We provide two separate score matching variations for general use, an importance weighting (IW) approach, and a variational approach. We provide finite sample bounds for our IW approach in finite domain settings and show it to have especially strong performance in small sample lower dimensional cases. Complementing this, we show our variational approach to be strongest in more complex high-dimensional settings which we demonstrate on graphical model estimation tasks on both real and simulated data.

Abstract: Many core problems in robotics can be framed as constrained optimization problems. Often on these problems, the robotic system has uncertainty, or it would be advantageous to identify multiple high quality feasible solutions. To enable this, we present two novel frameworks for applying principles of constrained optimization to the new variational inference algorithm Stein variational gradient descent. Our general framework supports multiple types of constrained optimizers and can handle arbitrary constraints. We demonstrate on a variety of problems that we are able to learn to approximate distributions without violating constraints. Specifically, we show that we can build distributions of: robot motion plans that exactly avoid collisions, robot arm joint angles on the SE(3) manifold with exact table placement constraints, and object poses from point clouds with table placement constraints.

Abstract: Anti-analysis techniques, particularly packing, challenge malware analysts, making packer identification fundamental. Existing packer identifiers have significant limitations: signature-based methods lack flexibility and struggle against dynamic evasion, while Machine Learning approaches require extensive training data, limiting scalability and adaptability. Consequently, achieving accurate and adaptable packer identification remains an open problem. This paper presents PackHero, a scalable and efficient methodology for identifying packers using a novel static approach. PackHero employs a Graph Matching Network and clustering to match and group Call Graphs from programs packed with known packers. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of malware and benign samples packed with various packers, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability across varying sample sizes. PackHero achieves a macro-average F1-score of 93.7% with just 10 samples per packer, improving to 98.3% with 100 samples. Notably, PackHero requires fewer samples to achieve stable performance compared to other Machine Learning-based tools. Overall, PackHero matches the performance of State-of-the-art signature-based tools, outperforming them in handling Virtualization-based packers such as Themida/Winlicense, with a recall of 100%.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is genetically complex, complicating robust classification from genomic data. METHODS: We developed a transformer-based ensemble model (TrUE-Net) using Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation in AD classification from whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We combined a transformer that preserves single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sequence structure with a concurrent random forest using flattened genotypes. An uncertainty threshold separated samples into an uncertain (high-variance) group and a more certain (low-variance) group. RESULTS: We analyzed 1050 individuals, holding out half for testing. Overall accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.6514 and 0.6636, respectively. Excluding the uncertain group improved accuracy from 0.6263 to 0.7287 (10.24% increase) and F1 from 0.5843 to 0.8205 (23.62% increase). DISCUSSION: Monte Carlo Dropout-driven uncertainty helps identify ambiguous cases that may require further clinical evaluation, thus improving reliability in AD genomic classification.

Abstract: Ontologies are pivotal for structuring knowledge bases to enhance question answering (QA) systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, traditional ontology creation relies on manual efforts by domain experts, a process that is time intensive, error prone, and impractical for large, dynamic knowledge domains. This paper introduces OntoRAG, an automated pipeline designed to derive ontologies from unstructured knowledge bases, with a focus on electrical relay documents. OntoRAG integrates advanced techniques, including web scraping, PDF parsing, hybrid chunking, information extraction, knowledge graph construction, and ontology creation, to transform unstructured data into a queryable ontology. By leveraging LLMs and graph based methods, OntoRAG enhances global sensemaking capabilities, outperforming conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG approaches in comprehensiveness and diversity. Experimental results demonstrate OntoRAGs effectiveness, achieving a comprehensiveness win rate of 85% against vector RAG and 75% against GraphRAGs best configuration. This work addresses the critical challenge of automating ontology creation, advancing the vision of the semantic web.

<title>Thinking Out of the Box: Hybrid SAT Solving by Unconstrained Continuous Optimization</title>

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem lies at the core of many applications in combinatorial optimization, software verification, cryptography, and machine learning. While state-of-the-art solvers have demonstrated high efficiency in handling conjunctive normal form (CNF) formulas, numerous applications require non-CNF (hybrid) constraints, such as XOR, cardinality, and Not-All-Equal constraints. Recent work leverages polynomial representations to represent such hybrid constraints, but it relies on box constraints that can limit the use of powerful unconstrained optimizers. In this paper, we propose unconstrained continuous optimization formulations for hybrid SAT solving by penalty terms. We provide theoretical insights into when these penalty terms are necessary and demonstrate empirically that unconstrained optimizers (e.g., Adam) can enhance SAT solving on hybrid benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of combining continuous optimization and machine-learning-based methods for effective hybrid SAT solving.

Abstract: Neural audio autoencoders create compact latent representations that preserve perceptually important information, serving as the foundation for both modern audio compression systems and generation approaches like next-token prediction and latent diffusion. Despite their prevalence, most audio processing operations, such as spatial and spectral up-sampling, still inefficiently operate on raw waveforms or spectral representations rather than directly on these compressed representations. We propose a framework that performs audio processing operations entirely within an autoencoder's latent space, eliminating the need to decode to raw audio formats. Our approach dramatically simplifies training by operating solely in the latent domain, with a latent L1 reconstruction term, augmented by a single latent adversarial discriminator. This contrasts sharply with raw-audio methods that typically require complex combinations of multi-scale losses and discriminators. Through experiments in bandwidth extension and mono-to-stereo up-mixing, we demonstrate computational efficiency gains of up to 100x while maintaining quality comparable to post-processing on raw audio. This work establishes a more efficient paradigm for audio processing pipelines that already incorporate autoencoders, enabling significantly faster and more resource-efficient workflows across various audio tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3) recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test 3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors, highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings.

Abstract: Vector-Quantized Generative Models (VQGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for image generation. However, the key component of VQGMs -- the codebook of discrete tokens -- is still not well understood, e.g., which tokens are critical to generate an image of a certain concept? This paper introduces Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX), a novel approach for interpreting VQGMs by identifying concept-specific token combinations. Our framework employs two methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token importance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation method that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens. Experimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear explanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines across multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX is useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangTianze009/CORTEX.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

<title>From Argumentative Text to Argument Knowledge Graph: A New Framework for Structured Argumentation</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features. We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference over arguments and the relations between them.

Abstract: We present Common Inpainted Objects In-N-Out of Context (COinCO), a novel dataset addressing the scarcity of out-of-context examples in existing vision datasets. By systematically replacing objects in COCO images through diffusion-based inpainting, we create 97,722 unique images featuring both contextually coherent and inconsistent scenes, enabling effective context learning. Each inpainted object is meticulously verified and categorized as in- or out-of-context through a multimodal large language model assessment. Our analysis reveals significant patterns in semantic priors that influence inpainting success across object categories. We demonstrate three key tasks enabled by COinCO: (1) training context classifiers that effectively determine whether existing objects belong in their context; (2) a novel Objects-from-Context prediction task that determines which new objects naturally belong in given scenes at both instance and clique levels, and (3) context-enhanced fake detection on state-of-the-art methods without fine-tuning. COinCO provides a controlled testbed with contextual variations, establishing a foundation for advancing context-aware visual understanding in computer vision and image forensics. Our code and data are at: https://github.com/YangTianze009/COinCO.

Abstract: Defects are ubiquitous in solids and strongly influence materials' mechanical and functional properties. However, non-destructive characterization and quantification of defects, especially when multiple types coexist, remain a long-standing challenge. Here we introduce DefectNet, a foundation machine learning model that predicts the chemical identity and concentration of substitutional point defects with multiple coexisting elements directly from vibrational spectra, specifically phonon density-of-states (PDoS). Trained on over 16,000 simulated spectra from 2,000 semiconductors, DefectNet employs a tailored attention mechanism to identify up to six distinct defect elements at concentrations ranging from 0.2% to 25%. The model generalizes well to unseen crystals across 56 elements and can be fine-tuned on experimental data. Validation using inelastic scattering measurements of SiGe alloys and MgB$_2$ superconductor demonstrates its accuracy and transferability. Our work establishes vibrational spectroscopy as a viable, non-destructive probe for point defect quantification in bulk materials, and highlights the promise of foundation models in data-driven defect engineering.

<title>Alignment Revisited: Are Large Language Models Consistent in Stated and Revealed Preferences?</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need to align their behaviors with human values. A critical, yet understudied, issue is the potential divergence between an LLM's stated preferences (its reported alignment with general principles) and its revealed preferences (inferred from decisions in contextualized scenarios). Such deviations raise fundamental concerns for the interpretability, trustworthiness, reasoning transparency, and ethical deployment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications. This work formally defines and proposes a method to measure this preference deviation. We investigate how LLMs may activate different guiding principles in specific contexts, leading to choices that diverge from previously stated general principles. Our approach involves crafting a rich dataset of well-designed prompts as a series of forced binary choices and presenting them to LLMs. We compare LLM responses to general principle prompts stated preference with LLM responses to contextualized prompts revealed preference, using metrics like KL divergence to quantify the deviation. We repeat the analysis across different categories of preferences and on four mainstream LLMs and find that a minor change in prompt format can often pivot the preferred choice regardless of the preference categories and LLMs in the test. This prevalent phenomenon highlights the lack of understanding and control of the LLM decision-making competence. Our study will be crucial for integrating LLMs into services, especially those that interact directly with humans, where morality, fairness, and social responsibilities are crucial dimensions. Furthermore, identifying or being aware of such deviation will be critically important as LLMs are increasingly envisioned for autonomous agentic tasks where continuous human evaluation of all LLMs' intermediary decision-making steps is impossible.

Abstract: This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&amp;A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) aims to describe the semantic contexts of general sounds, including acoustic events and scenes, by leveraging effective acoustic features. To enhance performance, an AAC method, EnCLAP, employed discrete tokens from EnCodec as an effective input for fine-tuning a language model BART. However, EnCodec is designed to reconstruct waveforms rather than capture the semantic contexts of general sounds, which AAC should describe. To address this issue, we propose CLAP-ART, an AAC method that utilizes ``semantic-rich and discrete'' tokens as input. CLAP-ART computes semantic-rich discrete tokens from pre-trained audio representations through vector quantization. We experimentally confirmed that CLAP-ART outperforms baseline EnCLAP on two AAC benchmarks, indicating that semantic-rich discrete tokens derived from semantically rich AR are beneficial for AAC.

Abstract: Tabular-image multimodal learning, which integrates structured tabular data with imaging data, holds great promise for a variety of tasks, especially in medical applications. Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs, underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.

Abstract: The linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework offers a principled foundation for reinforcement learning (RL) with strong theoretical guarantees and sample efficiency. However, its restrictive assumption-that both transition dynamics and reward functions are linear in the same feature space-limits its applicability in real-world domains, where rewards often exhibit nonlinear or discrete structures. Motivated by applications such as healthcare and e-commerce, where data is scarce and reward signals can be binary or count-valued, we propose the Generalized Linear MDP (GLMDP) framework-an extension of the linear MDP framework-that models rewards using generalized linear models (GLMs) while maintaining linear transition dynamics. We establish the Bellman completeness of GLMDPs with respect to a new function class that accommodates nonlinear rewards and develop two offline RL algorithms: Generalized Pessimistic Value Iteration (GPEVI) and a semi-supervised variant (SS-GPEVI) that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled trajectories. Our algorithms achieve theoretical guarantees on policy suboptimality and demonstrate improved sample efficiency in settings where reward labels are expensive or limited.

<title>HERGC: Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion for Multimodal Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs) by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Breaker: Removing Shortcut Cues with User Clustering for Single-slot Recommendation System</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00828</link>

Abstract: In a single-slot recommendation system, users are only exposed to one item at a time, and the system cannot collect user feedback on multiple items simultaneously. Therefore, only pointwise modeling solutions can be adopted, focusing solely on modeling the likelihood of clicks or conversions for items by users to learn user-item preferences, without the ability to capture the ranking information among different items directly. However, since user-side information is often much more abundant than item-side information, the model can quickly learn the differences in user intrinsic tendencies, which are independent of the items they are exposed to. This can cause these intrinsic tendencies to become a shortcut bias for the model, leading to insufficient mining of the most concerned user-item preferences. To solve this challenge, we introduce the Breaker model. Breaker integrates an auxiliary task of user representation clustering with a multi-tower structure for cluster-specific preference modeling. By clustering user representations, we ensure that users within each cluster exhibit similar characteristics, which increases the complexity of the pointwise recommendation task on the user side. This forces the multi-tower structure with cluster-driven parameter learning to better model user-item preferences, ultimately eliminating shortcut biases related to user intrinsic tendencies. In terms of training, we propose a delayed parameter update mechanism to enhance training stability and convergence, enabling end-to-end joint training of the auxiliary clustering and classification tasks. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the baselines. It has already been deployed and is actively serving tens of millions of users daily on Meituan, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms for services.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios, particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available at https://github.com/kzjkzj666/CompKE.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural path guiding method to aid with Monte Carlo (MC) integration in rendering. Existing neural methods utilize distribution representations that are either fast or expressive, but not both. We propose a simple, but effective, representation that is sufficiently expressive and reasonably fast. Specifically, we break down the 2D distribution over the directional domain into two 1D probability distribution functions (PDF). We propose to model each 1D PDF using a neural network that estimates the distribution at a set of discrete coordinates. The PDF at an arbitrary location can then be evaluated and sampled through interpolation. To train the network, we maximize the similarity of the learned and target distributions. To reduce the variance of the gradient during optimizations and estimate the normalization factor, we propose to cache the incoming radiance using an additional network. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is better than the existing methods, particularly in challenging scenes with complex light transport.

Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt. GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union, Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models, BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks. The dataset and model are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP

Abstract: Density ratio estimation (DRE) is a paramount task in machine learning, for its broad applications across multiple domains, such as covariate shift adaptation, causal inference, independence tests and beyond. Parametric methods for estimating the density ratio possibly lead to biased results if models are misspecified, while conventional non-parametric methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality when the dimension of data is large. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for DRE based on the projection pursuit (PP) approximation. The proposed method leverages PP to mitigate the impact of high dimensionality while retaining the model flexibility needed for the accuracy of DRE. We establish the consistency and the convergence rate for the proposed estimator. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing alternatives in various applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various software engineering tasks; however, their effectiveness in code migration, adapting code to run in different environments, remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we introduce CODEMENV: Code Migration Across Environment, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' abilities in code migration scenarios. CODEMENV consists of 922 examples spanning 19 Python and Java packages, and covers three core tasks: (1) identifying functions incompatible with specific versions, (2) detecting changes in function definitions, and (3) adapting code to target environments. Experimental evaluation with seven LLMs on CODEMENV yields an average pass@1 rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4O achieving the highest score at 43.84%. Key findings include: (i) LLMs tend to be more proficient with newer function versions, which aids in migrating legacy code, and (ii) LLMs sometimes exhibit logical inconsistencies by identifying function changes irrelevant to the intended migration environment. The datasets are available at https://github.com/xdshen-ai/Benchmark-of-Code-Migration.

Abstract: The construction industry faces significant challenges in optimizing equipment utilization, as underused machinery leads to increased operational costs and project delays. Accurate and timely monitoring of equipment activity is therefore key to identifying idle periods and improving overall efficiency. This paper presents the Edge-IMI framework for detecting idle construction machinery, specifically designed for integration with surveillance camera systems. The proposed solution consists of three components: object detection, tracking, and idle state identification, which are tailored for execution on resource-constrained, CPU-based edge computing devices. The performance of Edge-IMI is evaluated using a combined dataset derived from the ACID and MOCS benchmarks. Experimental results confirm that the object detector achieves an F1 score of 71.75%, indicating robust real-world detection capabilities. The logistic regression-based idle identification module reliably distinguishes between active and idle machinery with minimal false positives. Integrating all three modules, Edge-IMI enables efficient on-site inference, reducing reliance on high-bandwidth cloud services and costly hardware accelerators. We also evaluate the performance of object detection models on Raspberry Pi 5 and an Intel NUC platforms, as example edge computing platforms. We assess the feasibility of real-time processing and the impact of model optimization techniques.

Abstract: Designing protein sequences that fold into a target 3D structure, known as protein inverse folding, is a fundamental challenge in protein engineering. While recent deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance by recovering native sequences, they often overlook the one-to-many nature of the problem: multiple diverse sequences can fold into the same structure. This motivates the need for a generative model capable of designing diverse sequences while preserving structural consistency. To address this trade-off, we introduce ProtInvTree, the first reward-guided tree-search framework for protein inverse folding. ProtInvTree reformulates sequence generation as a deliberate, step-wise decision-making process, enabling the exploration of multiple design paths and exploitation of promising candidates through self-evaluation, lookahead, and backtracking. We propose a two-stage focus-and-grounding action mechanism that decouples position selection and residue generation. To efficiently evaluate intermediate states, we introduce a jumpy denoising strategy that avoids full rollouts. Built upon pretrained protein language models, ProtInvTree supports flexible test-time scaling by expanding the search depth and breadth without retraining. Empirically, ProtInvTree outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, generating structurally consistent yet diverse sequences, including those far from the native ground truth.

<title>Reconstruction and Prediction of Volterra Integral Equations Driven by Gaussian Noise</title>

Abstract: Integral equations are widely used in fields such as applied modeling, medical imaging, and system identification, providing a powerful framework for solving deterministic problems. While parameter identification for differential equations has been extensively studied, the focus on integral equations, particularly stochastic Volterra integral equations, remains limited. This research addresses the parameter identification problem, also known as the equation reconstruction problem, in Volterra integral equations driven by Gaussian noise. We propose an improved deep neural networks framework for estimating unknown parameters in the drift term of these equations. The network represents the primary variables and their integrals, enhancing parameter estimation accuracy by incorporating inter-output relationships into the loss function. Additionally, the framework extends beyond parameter identification to predict the system's behavior outside the integration interval. Prediction accuracy is validated by comparing predicted and true trajectories using a 95% confidence interval. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep neural networks framework in both parameter identification and prediction tasks, showing robust performance under varying noise levels and providing accurate solutions for modeling stochastic systems.

<title>Bridging the Gap: From Ad-hoc to Proactive Search in Conversations</title>

Abstract: Proactive search in conversations (PSC) aims to reduce user effort in formulating explicit queries by proactively retrieving useful relevant information given conversational context. Previous work in PSC either directly uses this context as input to off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or further fine-tunes them on PSC data. However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data. Extensive experiments on two PSC datasets show that Conv2Query significantly improves ad-hoc retrievers' performance, both when used directly and after fine-tuning on PSC.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

Abstract: We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors: (1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3) LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors. On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally, while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

Abstract: Identification of a person is central in forensic science, security, and healthcare. Methods such as iris scanning and genomic profiling are more accurate but expensive, time-consuming, and more difficult to implement. This study focuses on the relationship between the fingerprint patterns and the ABO blood group as a biometric identification tool. A total of 200 subjects were included in the study, and fingerprint types (loops, whorls, and arches) and blood groups were compared. Associations were evaluated with statistical tests, including chi-square and Pearson correlation. The study found that the loops were the most common fingerprint pattern and the O+ blood group was the most prevalent. Even though there was some associative pattern, there was no statistically significant difference in the fingerprint patterns of different blood groups. Overall, the results indicate that blood group data do not significantly improve personal identification when used in conjunction with fingerprinting. Although the study shows weak correlation, it may emphasize the efforts of multi-modal based biometric systems in enhancing the current biometric systems. Future studies may focus on larger and more diverse samples, and possibly machine learning and additional biometrics to improve identification methods. This study addresses an element of the ever-changing nature of the fields of forensic science and biometric identification, highlighting the importance of resilient analytical methods for personal identification.

Abstract: The Fourier representation for the uniform distribution over the Boolean cube has found numerous applications in algorithms and complexity analysis. Notably, in learning theory, learnability of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) under uniform as well as product distributions has been established through such representations. This paper makes five main contributions. First, it introduces a generalized Fourier expansion that can be used with any distribution $D$ through the representation of the distribution as a Bayesian network (BN). Second, it shows that the main algorithmic tools for learning with the Fourier representation, that use membership queries to approximate functions by recovering their heavy Fourier coefficients, can be used with slight modifications with the generalized expansion. These results hold for any distribution. Third, it analyzes the $L_1$ spectral norm of conjunctions under the new expansion, showing that it is bounded for a class of distributions which can be represented by difference bounded tree BN, where a parent node in the BN representation can change the conditional expectation of a child node by at most $\alpha<0.5$. Lower bounds are presented to show that such constraints are necessary. The fourth contribution uses these results to show the learnability of DNF with membership queries under difference bounded tree BN. The final contribution is to develop an algorithm for learning difference-bounded tree BN distributions, thus extending the DNF learnability result to cases where the distribution is not known in advance.

In this paper we propose a new diffusion posterior SMC sampler achieving improved statistical efficiencies, particularly under outlier conditions or highly informative likelihoods. The key idea is to construct an observation path that correlates with the diffusion model and to design the sampler to leverage this correlation for more efficient sampling. Empirical results conclude the efficiency.

Abstract: Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers optimized for general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference time, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable "hypertokens" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant that trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We show that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to use hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by 20-60\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time transaction monitoring framework that integrates graph-based modeling, narrative field embedding, and generative explanation to support automated financial compliance. The system constructs dynamic transaction graphs, extracts structural and contextual features, and classifies suspicious behavior using a graph neural network. A retrieval-augmented generation module generates natural language explanations aligned with regulatory clauses for each flagged transaction. Experiments conducted on a simulated stream of financial data show that the proposed method achieves superior results, with 98.2% F1-score, 97.8% precision, and 97.0% recall. Expert evaluation further confirms the quality and interpretability of generated justifications. The findings demonstrate the potential of combining graph intelligence and generative models to support explainable, audit-ready compliance in high-risk financial environments.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models are often trained in a setting where the number of parameters exceeds the number of training samples. To understand the implicit bias of gradient descent in such overparameterized models, prior work has studied diagonal linear neural networks in the regression setting. These studies have shown that, when initialized with small weights, gradient descent tends to favor solutions with minimal $\ell^1$-norm - an effect known as implicit regularization. In this paper, we investigate implicit regularization in diagonal linear neural networks of depth $D\ge 2$ for overparameterized linear regression problems. We focus on analyzing the approximation error between the limit point of gradient flow trajectories and the solution to the $\ell^1$-minimization problem. By deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the approximation error, we precisely characterize how the approximation error depends on the scale of initialization $\alpha$. Our results reveal a qualitative difference between depths: for $D \ge 3$, the error decreases linearly with $\alpha$, whereas for $D=2$, it decreases at rate $\alpha^{1-\varrho}$, where the parameter $\varrho \in [0,1)$ can be explicitly characterized. Interestingly, this parameter is closely linked to so-called null space property constants studied in the sparse recovery literature. We demonstrate the asymptotic tightness of our bounds through explicit examples. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and suggest that deeper networks, i.e., $D \ge 3$, may lead to better generalization, particularly for realistic initialization scales.

Abstract: System-generated logs are typically converted into categorical log templates through parsing. These templates are crucial for generating actionable insights in various downstream tasks. However, existing parsers often fail to capture fine-grained template details, leading to suboptimal accuracy and reduced utility in downstream tasks requiring precise pattern identification. We propose a character-level log parser utilizing a novel neural architecture that aggregates character embeddings. Our approach estimates a sequence of binary-coded decimals to achieve highly granular log templates extraction. Our low-resource character-level parser, tested on revised Loghub-2k and a manually annotated industrial dataset, matches LLM-based parsers in accuracy while outperforming semantic parsers in efficiency.

<title>Nearly-Linear Time Private Hypothesis Selection with the Optimal Approximation Factor</title>

Abstract: Estimating the density of a distribution from its samples is a fundamental problem in statistics. Hypothesis selection addresses the setting where, in addition to a sample set, we are given $n$ candidate distributions -- referred to as hypotheses -- and the goal is to determine which one best describes the underlying data distribution. This problem is known to be solvable very efficiently, requiring roughly $O(\log n)$ samples and running in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time. The quality of the output is measured via the total variation distance to the unknown distribution, and the approximation factor of the algorithm determines how large this distance is compared to the optimal distance achieved by the best candidate hypothesis. It is known that $\alpha = 3$ is the optimal approximation factor for this problem. We study hypothesis selection under the constraint of differential privacy. We propose a differentially private algorithm in the central model that runs in nearly-linear time with respect to the number of hypotheses, achieves the optimal approximation factor, and incurs only a modest increase in sample complexity, which remains polylogarithmic in $n$. This resolves an open question posed by [Bun, Kamath, Steinke, Wu, NeurIPS 2019]. Prior to our work, existing upper bounds required quadratic time.

Abstract: Leveraging high degrees of unstructured sparsity is a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of deep neural network DNN accelerators - particularly important for emerging Edge-AI applications. We introduce VUSA, a systolic-array architecture that virtually grows based on the present sparsity to perform larger matrix multiplications with the same number of physical multiply-accumulate MAC units. The proposed architecture achieves saving by 37% and 68% in area and power efficiency, respectively, at the same peak-performance, compared to a baseline systolic array architecture in a commercial 16-nm technology. Still, the proposed architecture supports acceleration for any DNN with any sparsity - even no sparsity at all. Thus, the proposed architecture is application-independent, making it viable for general-purpose AI acceleration.

Abstract: Fatigue-induced crack growth is a leading cause of structural failure across critical industries such as aerospace, civil engineering, automotive, and energy. Accurate prediction of stress intensity factors (SIFs) -- the key parameters governing crack propagation in linear elastic fracture mechanics -- is essential for assessing fatigue life and ensuring structural integrity. While machine learning (ML) has shown great promise in SIF prediction, its advancement has been severely limited by the lack of rich, transparent, well-organized, and high-quality datasets.
  To address this gap, we introduce SIFBench, an open-source, large-scale benchmark database designed to support ML-based SIF prediction. SIFBench contains over 5 million different crack and component geometries derived from high-fidelity finite element simulations across 37 distinct scenarios, and provides a unified Python interface for seamless data access and customization. We report baseline results using a range of popular ML models -- including random forests, support vector machines, feedforward neural networks, and Fourier neural operators -- alongside comprehensive evaluation metrics and template code for model training, validation, and assessment. By offering a standardized and scalable resource, SIFBench substantially lowers the entry barrier and fosters the development and application of ML methods in damage tolerance design and predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Despite progress in the rapidly developing field of geometric deep learning, performing statistical analysis on geometric data--where each observation is a shape such as a curve, graph, or surface--remains challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of shape spaces, which are defined as equivalence classes under invariance groups. Building machine learning frameworks that incorporate such invariances, notably to shape parametrization, is often crucial to ensure generalizability of the trained models to new observations. This work proposes SVarM to exploit varifold representations of shapes as measures and their duality with test functions $h:\mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$. This method provides a general framework akin to linear support vector machines but operating instead over the infinite-dimensional space of varifolds. We develop classification and regression models on shape datasets by introducing a neural network-based representation of the trainable test function $h$. This approach demonstrates strong performance and robustness across various shape graph and surface datasets, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.

<title>Incorporating Hierarchical Semantics in Sparse Autoencoder Architectures</title>

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (and, in particular, sparse autoencoders) attempts to learn a set of human-understandable concepts that can explain variation on an abstract space. A basic limitation of this approach is that it neither exploits nor represents the semantic relationships between the learned concepts. In this paper, we introduce a modified SAE architecture that explicitly models a semantic hierarchy of concepts. Application of this architecture to the internal representations of large language models shows both that semantic hierarchy can be learned, and that doing so improves both reconstruction and interpretability. Additionally, the architecture leads to significant improvements in computational efficiency.

Abstract: As large language models increasingly gain popularity in real-world applications, processing extremely long contexts, often exceeding the model's pre-trained context limits, has emerged as a critical challenge. While existing approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second, it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves over 50% and 27% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH, demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally, REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving both efficiency and superior performance.

Abstract: Despite its improvements in coding performance compared to traditional codecs, Learned Image Compression (LIC) suffers from large computational costs for storage and deployment. Model quantization offers an effective solution to reduce the computational complexity of LIC models. However, most existing works perform fixed-precision quantization which suffers from sub-optimal utilization of resources due to the varying sensitivity to quantization of different layers of a neural network. In this paper, we propose a Flexible Mixed Precision Quantization (FMPQ) method that assigns different bit-widths to different layers of the quantized network using the fractional change in rate-distortion loss as the bit-assignment criterion. We also introduce an adaptive search algorithm which reduces the time-complexity of searching for the desired distribution of quantization bit-widths given a fixed model size. Evaluation of our method shows improved BD-Rate performance under similar model size constraints compared to other works on quantization of LIC models. We have made the source code available at gitlab.com/viper-purdue/fmpq.

Abstract: We study parameterizations of stabilizing nonlinear policies for learning-based control. We propose a structure based on a nonlinear version of the Youla-Ku\v{c}era parameterization combined with robust neural networks such as the recurrent equilibrium network (REN). The resulting parameterizations are unconstrained, and hence can be searched over with first-order optimization methods, while always ensuring closed-loop stability by construction. We study the combination of (a) nonlinear dynamics, (b) partial observation, and (c) incremental closed-loop stability requirements (contraction and Lipschitzness). We find that with any two of these three difficulties, a contracting and Lipschitz Youla parameter always leads to contracting and Lipschitz closed loops. However, if all three hold, then incremental stability can be lost with exogenous disturbances. Instead, a weaker condition is maintained, which we call d-tube contraction and Lipschitzness. We further obtain converse results showing that the proposed parameterization covers all contracting and Lipschitz closed loops for certain classes of nonlinear systems. Numerical experiments illustrate the utility of our parameterization when learning controllers with built-in stability certificates for: i) ``economic'' rewards without stabilizing effects; ii) short training horizons; and iii) uncertain systems.

<title>Visual Sparse Steering: Improving Zero-shot Image Classification with Sparsity Guided Steering Vectors</title>

Abstract: Steering vision foundation models at inference time without retraining or access to large labeled datasets is a desirable yet challenging objective, particularly in dynamic or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we introduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that guides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features learned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data. Specifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on CUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet. We further propose VS2++, a retrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features using pseudo-labeled neighbors at inference time. With oracle positive/negative sets, VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over CLIP zero-shot of up to 21.44% on CIFAR-100, 7.08% on CUB-200, and 20.47% on Tiny-ImageNet. Interestingly, VS2 and VS2++ raise per-class accuracy by up to 25% and 38%, respectively, showing that sparse steering benefits specific classes by disambiguating visually or taxonomically proximate categories rather than providing a uniform boost. Finally, to better align the sparse features learned through the SAE reconstruction task with those relevant for downstream performance, we propose Prototype-Aligned Sparse Steering (PASS). By incorporating a prototype-alignment loss during SAE training, using labels only during training while remaining fully test-time unsupervised, PASS consistently, though modestly, outperforms VS2, achieving a 6.12% gain over VS2 only on CIFAR-100 with ViT-B/32.

Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order statistics. On the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a slight improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals are incorporated into Praat TextGrids using a point tier, and they are also output as a table for researchers to analyze separately as diagnostics or to incorporate uncertainty into their analyses.

Abstract: Despite tremendous advancements of machine learning models and algorithms in various application domains, they are known to be vulnerable to subtle, natural or intentionally crafted perturbations in future input data, known as adversarial attacks. While numerous adversarial learning methods have been proposed, fundamental questions about their statistical optimality in robust loss remain largely unanswered. In particular, the minimax rate of convergence and the construction of rate-optimal estimators under future $X$-attacks are yet to be worked out.
  In this paper, we address this issue in the context of nonparametric regression, under suitable assumptions on the smoothness of the regression function and the geometric structure of the input perturbation set. We first establish the minimax rate of convergence under adversarial $L_q$-risks with $1 \leq q \leq \infty$ and propose a piecewise local polynomial estimator that achieves the minimax optimality. The established minimax rate elucidates how the smoothness level and perturbation magnitude affect the fundamental limit of adversarial learning under future $X$-attacks. Furthermore, we construct a data-driven adaptive estimator that is shown to achieve, within a logarithmic factor, the optimal rate across a broad scale of nonparametric and adversarial classes.

Abstract: CleanS2S is a framework for human-like speech-to-speech interaction that advances conversational AI through single-file implementation and proactive dialogue capabilities. Our system integrates automatic speech recognition, large language models, and text-to-speech synthesis into a unified pipeline with real-time interruption handling, achieving low transition latency through full-duplex websocket connections and non-blocking I/O. Beyond conventional chatbot paradigms, we pioneer a proactive interaction mechanism, which combines memory systems with Subjective Action Judgement module, enabling five human-like response strategies: interruption, refusal, deflection, silence, and standard response. The memory module dynamically aggregates historical, and contextual data to inform interaction decisions. This approach breaks the rigid turn-based convention by allowing system-initiated dialog control and context-aware response selection. And we propose Action Judgement SFT that assesses input streams for responses strategies. The framework's single-file implementation with atomic configurations offers researchers unprecedented transparency and extensibility for interaction agents. The code of CleanS2S is released at \https://github.com/opendilab/CleanS2S.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning abilities, prompting the exploration of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) to extend the promise to decision domains. Due to involving more complex dynamics and temporal correlations, existing ICRL approaches may face challenges in learning from suboptimal trajectories and achieving precise in-context inference. In the paper, we propose \textbf{S}calable \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{Q}-\textbf{L}earning (\textbf{SICQL}), an innovative framework that harnesses dynamic programming and world modeling to steer ICRL toward efficient reward maximization and task generalization, while retaining the scalability and stability of supervised pretraining. We design a prompt-based multi-head transformer architecture that simultaneously predicts optimal policies and in-context value functions using separate heads. We pretrain a generalized world model to capture task-relevant information, enabling the construction of a compact prompt that facilitates fast and precise in-context inference. During training, we perform iterative policy improvement by fitting a state value function to an upper-expectile of the Q-function, and distill the in-context value functions into policy extraction using advantage-weighted regression. Extensive experiments across a range of discrete and continuous environments show consistent performance gains over various types of baselines, especially when learning from suboptimal data.

Abstract: A recent rise in online content expressing concerns with public health initiatives has contributed to already stalled uptake of preemptive measures globally. Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content, what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it. To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly, automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency before and after significant events.

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering $T$ trajectories of length $H$, each generated by one of $K$ unknown ergodic Markov chains over a finite state space of size $S$. The goal is to accurately group trajectories according to their underlying generative model. We begin by deriving an instance-dependent, high-probability lower bound on the clustering error rate, governed by the weighted KL divergence between the transition kernels of the chains. We then present a novel two-stage clustering algorithm. In Stage~I, we apply spectral clustering using a new injective Euclidean embedding for ergodic Markov chains -- a contribution of independent interest that enables sharp concentration results. Stage~II refines the initial clusters via a single step of likelihood-based reassignment. Our method achieves a near-optimal clustering error with high probability, under the conditions $H = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} (S^2 \vee \pi_{\min}^{-1}))$ and $TH = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} S^2 )$, where $\pi_{\min}$ is the minimum stationary probability of a state across the $K$ chains and $\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}$ is the minimum pseudo-spectral gap. These requirements provide significant improvements, if not at least comparable, to the state-of-the-art guarantee (Kausik et al., 2023), and moreover, our algorithm offers a key practical advantage: unlike existing approach, it requires no prior knowledge of model-specific quantities (e.g., separation between kernels or visitation probabilities). We conclude by discussing the inherent gap between our upper and lower bounds, providing insights into the unique structure of this clustering problem.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long chains of thought (CoTs). Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Qwen3-4B on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum ($k$ up to $256$), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher $k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$ performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23. Our code is available at https://github.com/TianHongZXY/RLVR-Decomposed.

Abstract: The integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in particular electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain --the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of 66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer interface with multiple modalities. All data, tools, and acquisition protocols are openly shared to foster open science in cognitive computing.

Abstract: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist represents a paradigm shift in scientific discovery, with large language models (LLMs) taking the lead as the primary executor in the entire scientific workflow from idea generation to experiment implementation. Recent AI Scientist studies demonstrate sufficient capabilities for independent scientific discovery, with the generated research reports gaining acceptance at the ICLR 2025 workshop and ACL 2025, arguing that a human-level AI Scientist, capable of uncovering phenomena previously unknown to humans, may be imminent. Despite this substantial progress, AI Scientist has yet to produce a groundbreaking achievement in the domain of computer science on par with automated scientific tools. Based on extensive quantitative evidence from existing benchmarks in complex engineering tasks and a systematic evaluation assess 28 research papers generated by five advanced AI Scientist systems, we argue that \textbf{the fundamental bottleneck for AI Scientists lies in their capability to execute the requisite verification procedures.} Current AI Scientist systems lack the execution capabilities needed to execute rigorous experiments and produce high-quality scientific papers. To better illustrate the root cause of this \textbf{implementation gap}, we provide an in-depth discussion on the fundamental limitations of AI Scientist. This position paper aims to call for the participants in the community to bridge the implementation gap.

Abstract: Low Altitude Economy (LAE) networks own transformative potential in urban mobility, emergency response, and aerial logistics. However, these networks face significant challenges in spectrum management, interference mitigation, and real-time coordination across dynamic and resource-constrained environments. After addressing these challenges, this study explores three core elements for enabling intelligent LAE networks as follows machine learning-based spectrum sensing and coexistence, artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized resource allocation and trajectory planning, and testbed-driven validation and standardization. We highlight how federated and reinforcement learning techniques support decentralized, adaptive decision-making under mobility and energy constraints. In addition, we discuss the role of real-world platforms such as AERPAW in bridging the gap between simulation and deployment and enabling iterative system refinement under realistic conditions. This study aims to provide a forward-looking roadmap toward developing efficient and interoperable AI-driven LAE ecosystems.

Abstract: As malware continues to become more complex and harder to detect, Malware Analysis needs to continue to evolve to stay one step ahead. One promising key area approach focuses on using system calls and API Calls, the core communication between user applications and the operating system and their kernels. These calls provide valuable insight into how software or programs behaves, making them an useful tool for spotting suspicious or harmful activity of programs and software. This chapter takes a deep down look at how system calls are used in malware detection and classification, covering techniques like static and dynamic analysis, as well as sandboxing. By combining these methods with advanced techniques like machine learning, statistical analysis, and anomaly detection, researchers can analyze system call patterns to tell the difference between normal and malicious behavior. The chapter also explores how these techniques are applied across different systems, including Windows, Linux, and Android, while also looking at the ways sophisticated malware tries to evade detection.

<title>Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/RAIF.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains, where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text poses emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4), raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external costly models at inference time. We leverage adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are used to distill anonymization, adversarial inference, and utility evaluation capabilities into SLMs via supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn to both anonymize text and critique their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy. These results show the effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework in training SLMs as efficient anonymizers. To facilitate further research, we release the full dataset used in our experiments.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that integrating multimodal data fusion techniques for imaging and genetic features is beneficial for the etiological analysis and predictive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are several critical flaws in current deep learning methods. Firstly, there has been insufficient discussion and exploration regarding the selection and encoding of genetic information. Secondly, due to the significantly superior classification value of AD imaging features compared to genetic features, many studies in multimodal fusion emphasize the strengths of imaging features, actively mitigating the influence of weaker features, thereby diminishing the learning of the unique value of genetic features. To address this issue, this study proposes the dynamic multimodal role-swapping network (GenDMR). In GenDMR, we develop a novel approach to encode the spatial organization of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enhancing the representation of their genomic context. Additionally, to adaptively quantify the disease risk of SNPs and brain region, we propose a multi-instance attention module to enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a dominant modality selection module and a contrastive self-distillation module, combining them to achieve a dynamic teacher-student role exchange mechanism based on dominant and auxiliary modalities for bidirectional co-updating of different modal data. Finally, GenDMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ADNI public dataset and visualizes attention to different SNPs, focusing on confirming 12 potential high-risk genes related to AD, including the most classic APOE and recently highlighted significant risk genes. This demonstrates GenDMR's interpretable analytical capability in exploring AD genetic features, providing new insights and perspectives for the development of multimodal data fusion techniques.

Abstract: Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully scaled to billion-scale large text-to-image datasets. However, training such models entails a high training cost, limiting some applications and research usage. To reduce the cost, one promising direction is the incorporation of pre-trained models. The existing method of utilizing pre-trained models for a generator significantly reduced the training cost compared with the other large-scale GANs, but we found the model loses the diversity of generation for a given prompt by a large margin. To build an efficient and high-fidelity text-to-image GAN without compromise, we propose to use two specialized discriminators with Slicing Adversarial Networks (SANs) adapted for text-to-image tasks. Our proposed model, called SCAD, shows a notable enhancement in diversity for a given prompt with better sample fidelity. We also propose to use a metric called Per-Prompt Diversity (PPD) to evaluate the diversity of text-to-image models quantitatively. SCAD achieved a zero-shot FID competitive with the latest large-scale GANs at two orders of magnitude less training cost.

Abstract: This paper introduces SpiceMixer, a genetic algorithm developed to synthesize novel analog circuits by evolving SPICE netlists. Unlike conventional methods, SpiceMixer operates directly on netlist lines, enabling compatibility with any component or subcircuit type and supporting general-purpose genetic operations. By using a normalized netlist format, the algorithm enhances the effectiveness of its genetic operators: crossover, mutation, and pruning. We show that SpiceMixer achieves superior performance in synthesizing standard cells (inverter, two-input NAND, and latch) and in designing an analog classifier circuit for the Iris dataset, reaching an accuracy of 89% on the test set. Across all evaluated tasks, SpiceMixer consistently outperforms existing synthesis methods.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have become an important tool for a wide range of applications, from computer vision to natural language processing. However, the computational complexity of DNN inference poses a significant challenge, particularly for processing on resource-constrained edge devices. One promising approach to address this challenge is the exploitation of sparsity in DNN operator weights.
  In this work, we present FlexiSAGA, an architecturally configurable and dataflow-flexible AI hardware accelerator for the sparse and dense processing of general matrix multiplications (GEMMs). FlexiSAGA supports seven different sparse and dense dataflows, enabling efficient processing of resource intensive DNN operators. Additionally, we propose a DNN pruning method specifically tailored towards the FlexiSAGA architecture, allowing for near-optimal processing of dense and sparse convolution and fully-connected operators, facilitating a DNN/HW co-design flow. Our results show a whole DNN sparse-over-dense inference speedup ranging from 1.41 up to 4.28, outperforming commercial and literature-reported accelerator platforms.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal models have shown remarkable versatility in real-world applications. However, their rapid development encounters two critical data challenges. First, the training process requires large-scale datasets, leading to substantial storage and computational costs. Second, these data are typically web-crawled with inevitable noise, i.e., partially mismatched pairs, severely degrading model performance. To these ends, we propose Multi-modal dataset Distillation in the Wild, i.e., MDW, the first framework to distill noisy multi-modal datasets into compact clean ones for effective and efficient model training. Specifically, MDW introduces learnable fine-grained correspondences during distillation and adaptively optimizes distilled data to emphasize correspondence-discriminative regions, thereby enhancing distilled data's information density and efficacy. Moreover, to capture robust cross-modal correspondence prior knowledge from real data, MDW proposes dual-track collaborative learning to avoid the risky data noise, alleviating information loss with certifiable noise tolerance. Extensive experiments validate MDW's theoretical and empirical efficacy with remarkable scalability, surpassing prior methods by over 15% across various compression ratios, highlighting its appealing practicality for applications with diverse efficacy and resource needs.

Abstract: Word sense analysis is an essential analysis work for interpreting the linguistic and social backgrounds. The word sense change detection is a task of identifying and interpreting shifts in word meanings over time. This paper proposes MMD-Sense-Analysis, a novel approach that leverages Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to select semantically meaningful variables and quantify changes across time periods. This method enables both the identification of words undergoing sense shifts and the explanation of their evolution over multiple historical periods. To my knowledge, this is the first application of MMD to word sense change detection. Empirical assessment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Understanding behavior requires datasets that capture humans while carrying out complex tasks. The kitchen is an excellent environment for assessing human motor and cognitive function, as many complex actions are naturally exhibited in kitchens from chopping to cleaning. Here, we introduce the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset, collected in a noninvasive motion capture platform inside a kitchen environment. Nine static RGB-D cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs) and one head-mounted HoloLens~2 headset were used to capture 3D hand, body, and eye movements. The EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset is a multi-view action dataset with synchronized exocentric, egocentric, depth, IMUs, eye gaze, body and hand kinematics spanning 29.7 hours of 16 subjects cooking four different recipes. Action sequences were densely annotated with 33.78 action segments per minute. Leveraging this multi-modal dataset, we propose four benchmarks to advance behavior understanding and modeling through 1) a vision-language benchmark, 2) a semantic text-to-motion generation benchmark, 3) a multi-modal action recognition benchmark, 4) a pose-based action segmentation benchmark. We expect the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset to pave the way for better methods as well as insights to understand the nature of ecologically-valid human behavior.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with dysarthric speech due to high inter-speaker variability and slow speaking rates. To address this, we explore dysarthric-to-healthy speech conversion for improved ASR performance. Our approach extends the Rhythm and Voice (RnV) conversion framework by introducing a syllable-based rhythm modeling method suited for dysarthric speech. We assess its impact on ASR by training LF-MMI models and fine-tuning Whisper on converted speech. Experiments on the Torgo corpus reveal that LF-MMI achieves significant word error rate reductions, especially for more severe cases of dysarthria, while fine-tuning Whisper on converted data has minimal effect on its performance. These results highlight the potential of unsupervised rhythm and voice conversion for dysarthric ASR. Code available at: https://github.com/idiap/RnV

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.

Abstract: Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer via imagination-based analogy mapping.

Abstract: The development of AI agents based on large, open-domain language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of general-purpose AI assistants that can support human in tasks such as writing, coding, graphic design, and scientific research. A major challenge with such agents is that, by necessity, they are trained by observing relatively short-term interactions with humans. Such models can fail to generalize to long-term interactions, for example, interactions where a user has repeatedly corrected mistakes on the part of the agent. In this work, we argue that these challenges can be overcome by explicitly modeling humans' social intelligence, that is, their ability to build and maintain long-term relationships with other agents whose behavior cannot always be predicted. By mathematically modeling the strategies humans use to communicate and reason about one another over long periods of time, we may be able to derive new game theoretic objectives against which LLMs and future AI agents may be optimized.

Abstract: Temporal alignment of multiple signals through time warping is crucial in many fields, such as classification within speech recognition or robot motion learning. Almost all related works are limited to data in Euclidean space. Although an attempt was made in 2011 to adapt this concept to unit quaternions, a general extension to Riemannian manifolds remains absent. Given its importance for numerous applications in robotics and beyond, we introduce Riemannian Time Warping~(RTW). This novel approach efficiently aligns multiple signals by considering the geometric structure of the Riemannian manifold in which the data is embedded. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including tests with an LBR iiwa robot, demonstrate that RTW consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both averaging and classification tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have gained traction in home energy management systems. However, their adoption by energy management companies remains limited due to the black-box nature of DRL, which fails to provide transparent decision-making feedback. To address this, explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) techniques have emerged, aiming to make DRL decisions more transparent. Among these, soft differential decision tree (DDT) distillation provides a promising approach due to the clear decision rules they are based on, which can be efficiently computed. However, achieving high performance often requires deep, and completely full, trees, which reduces interpretability. To overcome this, we propose a novel asymmetric soft DDT construction method. Unlike traditional soft DDTs, our approach adaptively constructs trees by expanding nodes only when necessary. This improves the efficient use of decision nodes, which require a predetermined depth to construct full symmetric trees, enhancing both interpretability and performance. We demonstrate the potential of asymmetric DDTs to provide transparent, efficient, and high-performing decision-making in home energy management systems.

Abstract: We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1 136 multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling transparent evaluation and supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231 foundational frameworks, standards, reports and recommendation documents from seven authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and adaptation potential of the model, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (ranging from 0.5 B to 671 B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies typically around 55--70\%, highlighting ESGenius's challenging nature for LLMs in interdisciplinary contexts. However, models employing RAG show significant performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example, "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B" improves from 63.82\% (zero-shot) to 80.46\% with RAG. These results underscore the necessity of grounding responses in authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our knowledge, ESGenius is the first benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant enhancement technologies that focuses on ESG and sustainability topics.

Abstract: Despite substantial research into the biological basis of memory, the precise mechanisms by which experiences are encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain remain incompletely understood. A growing body of evidence supports the engram theory, which posits that sparse populations of neurons undergo lasting physical and biochemical changes to support long-term memory. Yet, a comprehensive computational framework that integrates biological findings with mechanistic models remains elusive. This work synthesizes insights from cellular neuroscience and computational modeling to address key challenges in engram research: how engram neurons are identified and manipulated; how synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to stable memory traces; and how sparsity promotes efficient, interference-resistant representations. Relevant computational approaches -- such as sparse regularization, engram gating, and biologically inspired architectures like Sparse Distributed Memory and spiking neural networks -- are also examined. Together, these findings suggest that memory efficiency, capacity, and stability emerge from the interaction of plasticity and sparsity constraints. By integrating neurobiological and computational perspectives, this paper provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for engram research and proposes a roadmap for future inquiry into the mechanisms underlying memory, with implications for the diagnosis and treatment of memory-related disorders.

Abstract: As AI regulations around the world intensify their focus on system safety, contestability has become a mandatory, yet ill-defined, safeguard. In XAI, "contestability" remains an empty promise: no formal definition exists, no algorithm guarantees it, and practitioners lack concrete guidance to satisfy regulatory requirements. Grounded in a systematic literature review, this paper presents the first rigorous formal definition of contestability in explainable AI, directly aligned with stakeholder requirements and regulatory mandates. We introduce a modular framework of by-design and post-hoc mechanisms spanning human-centered interfaces, technical architectures, legal processes, and organizational workflows. To operationalize our framework, we propose the Contestability Assessment Scale, a composite metric built on more than twenty quantitative criteria. Through multiple case studies across diverse application domains, we reveal where state-of-the-art systems fall short and show how our framework drives targeted improvements. By converting contestability from regulatory theory into a practical framework, our work equips practitioners with the tools to embed genuine recourse and accountability into AI systems.

Abstract: Efficiently compiling quantum operations remains a major bottleneck in scaling quantum computing. Today's state-of-the-art methods achieve low compilation error by combining search algorithms with gradient-based parameter optimization, but they incur long runtimes and require multiple calls to quantum hardware or expensive classical simulations, making their scaling prohibitive. Recently, machine-learning models have emerged as an alternative, though they are currently restricted to discrete gate sets. Here, we introduce a multimodal denoising diffusion model that simultaneously generates a circuit's structure and its continuous parameters for compiling a target unitary. It leverages two independent diffusion processes, one for discrete gate selection and one for parameter prediction. We benchmark the model over different experiments, analyzing the method's accuracy across varying qubit counts, circuit depths, and proportions of parameterized gates. Finally, by exploiting its rapid circuit generation, we create large datasets of circuits for particular operations and use these to extract valuable heuristics that can help us discover new insights into quantum circuit synthesis.

<title>Geometry Meets Incentives: Sample-Efficient Incentivized Exploration with Linear Contexts</title>

Abstract: In the incentivized exploration model, a principal aims to explore and learn over time by interacting with a sequence of self-interested agents. It has been recently understood that the main challenge in designing incentive-compatible algorithms for this problem is to gather a moderate amount of initial data, after which one can obtain near-optimal regret via posterior sampling. With high-dimensional contexts, however, this \emph{initial exploration} phase requires exponential sample complexity in some cases, which prevents efficient learning unless initial data can be acquired exogenously. We show that these barriers to exploration disappear under mild geometric conditions on the set of available actions, in which case incentive-compatibility does not preclude regret-optimality. Namely, we consider the linear bandit model with actions in the Euclidean unit ball, and give an incentive-compatible exploration algorithm with sample complexity that scales polynomially with the dimension and other parameters.

<title>A Descriptive and Normative Theory of Human Beliefs in RLHF</title>

Abstract: Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.

<title>Signature Maximum Mean Discrepancy Two-Sample Statistical Tests</title>

Abstract: Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a widely used concept in machine learning research which has gained popularity in recent years as a highly effective tool for comparing (finite-dimensional) distributions. Since it is designed as a kernel-based method, the MMD can be extended to path space valued distributions using the signature kernel. The resulting signature MMD (sig-MMD) can be used to define a metric between distributions on path space. Similarly to the original use case of the MMD as a test statistic within a two-sample testing framework, the sig-MMD can be applied to determine if two sets of paths are drawn from the same stochastic process. This work is dedicated to understanding the possibilities and challenges associated with applying the sig-MMD as a statistical tool in practice. We introduce and explain the sig-MMD, and provide easily accessible and verifiable examples for its practical use. We present examples that can lead to Type 2 errors in the hypothesis test, falsely indicating that samples have been drawn from the same underlying process (which generally occurs in a limited data setting). We then present techniques to mitigate the occurrence of this type of error.

Abstract: The control of spatio-temporally chaos is challenging because of high dimensionality and unpredictability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) discovers optimal control policies by interacting with the system, typically requiring observations of the full physical state.In practice, sensors often provide only partial and noisy measurements (observations) of the system. The objective of this paper is to develop a framework that enables the control of chaotic systems with partial and noisy observability. The proposed method, data-assimilated model-informed reinforcement learning (DA-MIRL), integrates (i) low-order models to approximate high-dimensional dynamics; (ii) sequential data assimilation to correct the model prediction when observations become available; and (iii) an off-policy actor-critic RL algorithm to adaptively learn an optimal control strategy based on the corrected state estimates. We test DA-MIRL on the spatiotemporally chaotic solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We estimate the full state of the environment with (i) a physics-based model, here, a coarse-grained model; and (ii) a data-driven model, here, the control-aware echo state network, which is proposed in this paper. We show that DA-MIRL successfully estimates and suppresses the chaotic dynamics of the environment in real time from partial observations and approximate models. This work opens opportunities for the control of partially observable chaotic systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various tasks, yet concerns about their safety and security have emerged. In particular, they pose risks in generating harmful content and vulnerability to jailbreaking attacks. To analyze and monitor machine learning models, model-based analysis has demonstrated notable potential in stateful deep neural networks, yet suffers from scalability issues when extending to LLMs due to their vast feature spaces. In this paper, we propose ReGA, a model-based analysis framework with representation-guided abstraction, to safeguard LLMs against harmful prompts and generations. By leveraging safety-critical representations, which are low-dimensional directions emerging in hidden states that indicate safety-related concepts, ReGA effectively addresses the scalability issue when constructing the abstract model for safety modeling. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that ReGA performs sufficiently well in distinguishing between safe and harmful inputs, achieving an AUROC of 0.975 at the prompt level and 0.985 at the conversation level. Additionally, ReGA exhibits robustness to real-world attacks and generalization across different safety perspectives, outperforming existing safeguard paradigms in terms of interpretability and scalability. Overall, ReGA serves as an efficient and scalable solution to enhance LLM safety by integrating representation engineering with model-based abstraction, paving the way for new paradigms to utilize software insights for AI safety.

Abstract: We study the challenging problem of unsupervised multi-object segmentation on single images. Existing methods, which rely on image reconstruction objectives to learn objectness or leverage pretrained image features to group similar pixels, often succeed only in segmenting simple synthetic objects or discovering a limited number of real-world objects. In this paper, we introduce unMORE, a novel two-stage pipeline designed to identify many complex objects in real-world images. The key to our approach involves explicitly learning three levels of carefully defined object-centric representations in the first stage. Subsequently, our multi-object reasoning module utilizes these learned object priors to discover multiple objects in the second stage. Notably, this reasoning module is entirely network-free and does not require human labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that unMORE significantly outperforms all existing unsupervised methods across 6 real-world benchmark datasets, including the challenging COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art object segmentation results. Remarkably, our method excels in crowded images where all baselines collapse.

<title>An adaptive data sampling strategy for stabilizing dynamical systems via controller inference</title>

Abstract: Learning stabilizing controllers from data is an important task in engineering applications; however, collecting informative data is challenging because unstable systems often lead to rapidly growing or erratic trajectories. In this work, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme that generates data while simultaneously stabilizing the system to avoid instabilities during the data collection. Under mild assumptions, the approach provably generates data sets that are informative for stabilization and have minimal size. The numerical experiments demonstrate that controller inference with the novel adaptive sampling approach learns controllers with up to one order of magnitude fewer data samples than unguided data generation. The results show that the proposed approach opens the door to stabilizing systems in edge cases and limit states where instabilities often occur and data collection is inherently difficult.

<title>Fodor and Pylyshyn's Legacy - Still No Human-like Systematic Compositionality in Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Strong meta-learning capabilities for systematic compositionality are emerging as an important skill for navigating the complex and changing tasks of today's world. However, in presenting models for robust adaptation to novel environments, it is important to refrain from making unsupported claims about the performance of meta-learning systems that ultimately do not stand up to scrutiny. While Fodor and Pylyshyn famously posited that neural networks inherently lack this capacity as they are unable to model compositional representations or structure-sensitive operations, and thus are not a viable model of the human mind, Lake and Baroni recently presented meta-learning as a pathway to compositionality. In this position paper, we critically revisit this claim and highlight limitations in the proposed meta-learning framework for compositionality. Our analysis shows that modern neural meta-learning systems can only perform such tasks, if at all, under a very narrow and restricted definition of a meta-learning setup. We therefore claim that `Fodor and Pylyshyn's legacy' persists, and to date, there is no human-like systematic compositionality learned in neural networks.

Abstract: Discrete speech units (DSUs) are derived from clustering the features of self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). DSUs offer significant advantages for on-device streaming speech applications due to their rich phonetic information, high transmission efficiency, and seamless integration with large language models. However, conventional DSU-based approaches are impractical as they require full-length speech input and computationally expensive S3Ms. In this work, we reduce both the attention window and the model size while preserving the effectiveness of DSUs. Our results demonstrate that we can reduce floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 50% with only a relative increase of 6.5% in character error rate (CER) on the ML-SUPERB 1h dataset. These findings highlight the potential of DSUs for real-time speech processing in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on instruction-following tasks by integrating pretrained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often struggle to ground fine-grained visual concepts in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose MoDA (Modulation Adapter), a lightweight yet effective module designed to refine pre-aligned visual features through instruction-guided modulation. Our approach follows the standard LLaVA training protocol, consisting of a two-stage process: (1) aligning image features to the LLMs input space via a frozen vision encoder and adapter layers, and (2) refining those features using the MoDA adapter during the instructional tuning stage. MoDA employs a Transformer-based cross-attention mechanism to generate a modulation mask over the aligned visual tokens, thereby emphasizing semantically relevant embedding dimensions based on the language instruction. The modulated features are then passed to the LLM for autoregressive language generation. Our experimental evaluation shows that MoDA improves visual grounding and generates more contextually appropriate responses, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general-purpose enhancement for image-based MLLMs.

Abstract: The characterization of Hamiltonians and other components of open quantum dynamical systems plays a crucial role in quantum computing and other applications. Scientific machine learning techniques have been applied to this problem in a variety of ways, including by modeling with deep neural networks. However, the majority of mathematical models describing open quantum systems are linear, and the natural nonlinearities in learnable models have not been incorporated using physical principles. We present a data-driven model for open quantum systems that includes learnable, thermodynamically consistent terms. The trained model is interpretable, as it directly estimates the system Hamiltonian and linear components of coupling to the environment. We validate the model on synthetic two and three-level data, as well as experimental two-level data collected from a quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose SineKAN, the NQS ansatz based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \sk wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the 1D Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the SineKAN model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state ans\"atze, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFCN), when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm.

This leverages ideas from (1) controlled equilibrium dynamics, which gradually transport between two path measures, and (2) optimization in $\infty$-dimensional probability space endowed with a Wasserstein metric, which can be used to evolve a density curve under the specified likelihood. The resulting algorithms are theoretically grounded and can be integrated seamlessly with neural networks for learning the target trajectory ensembles, without access to data.

Abstract: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning not only enhances large language model performance but also provides critical insights into decision-making processes, marking it as a useful tool for monitoring model intent and planning. By proactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or harmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with deploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the appearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or regulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a specific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT presentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes obfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the undesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT monitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization to latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide an extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of specific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to substitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying method by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can learn to steganographically encode its reasoning. We further demonstrate that models can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to an overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in training, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the class which it can apply to held-out testing strings.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation. Among this family of models, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) achieve the strongest performance but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack key inference-time efficiency features--most notably, KV caching. In this work, we introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms, enabling smooth interpolation between their perplexities while overcoming their respective limitations. Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on standard language modeling benchmarks. Crucially, we are the **first to introduce KV caching for MDMs** while preserving parallel generation, significantly improving inference efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, our method achieves up to **65x** faster inference than standard MDMs and **4x** faster inference than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page: [http://s-sahoo.github.io/Eso-LMs](http://s-sahoo.github.io/Eso-LMs)

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images from natural language prompts. However, they often fail to produce semantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations that contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual contradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled associations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware prompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a sequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the semantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while ensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify contradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original intent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information with the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic control and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual contradictions. Experiments across a variety of challenging prompts show substantial improvements in alignment to the textual prompt.

<title>Should Decision-Makers Reveal Classifiers in Online Strategic Classification?</title>

Abstract: Strategic classification addresses a learning problem where a decision-maker implements a classifier over agents who may manipulate their features in order to receive favorable predictions. In the standard model of online strategic classification, in each round, the decision-maker implements and publicly reveals a classifier, after which agents perfectly best respond based on this knowledge. However, in practice, whether to disclose the classifier is often debated -- some decision-makers believe that hiding the classifier can prevent misclassification errors caused by manipulation.
  In this paper, we formally examine how limiting the agents' access to the current classifier affects the decision-maker's performance. Specifically, we consider an extended online strategic classification setting where agents lack direct knowledge about the current classifier and instead manipulate based on a weighted average of historically implemented classifiers. Our main result shows that in this setting, the decision-maker incurs $(1-\gamma)^{-1}$ or $k_{\text{in}}$ times more mistakes compared to the full-knowledge setting, where $k_{\text{in}}$ is the maximum in-degree of the manipulation graph (representing how many distinct feature vectors can be manipulated to appear as a single one), and $\gamma$ is the discount factor indicating agents' memory of past classifiers. Our results demonstrate how withholding access to the classifier can backfire and degrade the decision-maker's performance in online strategic classification.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Emerging economies, particularly the MINT countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and T\"urkiye), are gaining influence in global stock markets, although they remain susceptible to the economic conditions of developed countries like the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). This interconnectedness and sensitivity of financial markets make understanding these relationships crucial for investors and policymakers to predict stock price movements accurately. To this end, we examined the main stock market indices of G7 and MINT countries from 2012 to 2024, using a recent graph neural network (GNN) algorithm called multivariate time series forecasting with graph neural network (MTGNN). This method allows for considering complex spatio-temporal connections in multivariate time series. In the implementations, MTGNN revealed that the US and Canada are the most influential G7 countries regarding stock indices in the forecasting process, and Indonesia and T\"urkiye are the most influential MINT countries. Additionally, our results showed that MTGNN outperformed traditional methods in forecasting the prices of stock market indices for MINT and G7 countries. Consequently, the study offers valuable insights into economic blocks' markets and presents a compelling empirical approach to analyzing global stock market dynamics using MTGNN.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering (MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically, on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs, outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

Abstract: Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks. WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro, there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena, highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

<title>DRAG: Distilling RAG for SLMs from LLMs to Transfer Knowledge and Mitigate Hallucination via Evidence and Graph-based Distillation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have proven highly effective for tasks requiring factual consistency and robust knowledge retrieval. However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.

Abstract: Prior methods for controlling image generation are limited in their ability to be taught new tasks. In contrast, vision-language models, or VLMs, can learn tasks in-context and produce the correct outputs for a given input. We propose a dual-process distillation scheme that allows feed-forward image generators to learn new tasks from deliberative VLMs. Our scheme uses a VLM to rate the generated images and backpropagates this gradient to update the weights of the image generator. Our general framework enables a wide variety of new control tasks through the same text-and-image based interface. We showcase a handful of applications of this technique for different types of control signals, such as commonsense inferences and visual prompts. With our method, users can implement multimodal controls for properties such as color palette, line weight, horizon position, and relative depth within a matter of minutes.

Abstract: Our fast-paced digital economy shaped by global competition requires increased data-driven decision-making based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The benefits of deep learning (DL) are manifold, but it comes with limitations that have, so far, interfered with widespread industry adoption. This paper explains why DL, despite its popularity, has difficulties speeding up its adoption within business analytics. It is shown that the adoption of deep learning is not only affected by computational complexity, lacking big data architecture, lack of transparency (black-box), skill shortage, and leadership commitment, but also by the fact that DL does not outperform traditional ML models in the case of structured datasets with fixed-length feature vectors. Deep learning should be regarded as a powerful addition to the existing body of ML models instead of a one size fits all solution. The results strongly suggest that gradient boosting can be seen as the go-to model for predictions on structured datasets within business analytics. In addition to the empirical study based on three industry use cases, the paper offers a comprehensive discussion of those results, practical implications, and a roadmap for future research.

Abstract: The realization that AI-driven decision-making is indispensable in today's fast-paced and ultra-competitive marketplace has raised interest in industrial machine learning (ML) applications significantly. The current demand for analytics experts vastly exceeds the supply. One solution to this problem is to increase the user-friendliness of ML frameworks to make them more accessible for the non-expert. Automated machine learning (AutoML) is an attempt to solve the problem of expertise by providing fully automated off-the-shelf solutions for model choice and hyperparameter tuning. This paper analyzed the potential of AutoML for applications within business analytics, which could help to increase the adoption rate of ML across all industries. The H2O AutoML framework was benchmarked against a manually tuned stacked ML model on three real-world datasets. The manually tuned ML model could reach a performance advantage in all three case studies used in the experiment. Nevertheless, the H2O AutoML package proved to be quite potent. It is fast, easy to use, and delivers reliable results, which come close to a professionally tuned ML model. The H2O AutoML framework in its current capacity is a valuable tool to support fast prototyping with the potential to shorten development and deployment cycles. It can also bridge the existing gap between supply and demand for ML experts and is a big step towards automated decisions in business analytics. Finally, AutoML has the potential to foster human empowerment in a world that is rapidly becoming more automated and digital.

<title>Conflict-Aware Pseudo Labeling via Optimal Transport for Entity Alignment</title>

Abstract: Entity alignment aims to discover unique equivalent entity pairs with the same meaning across different knowledge graphs (KGs). Existing models have focused on projecting KGs into a latent embedding space so that inherent semantics between entities can be captured for entity alignment. However, the adverse impacts of alignment conflicts have been largely overlooked during training, thereby limiting the entity alignment performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Conflict-aware Pseudo Labeling via Optimal Transport model (CPL-OT) for entity alignment. The key idea is to iteratively pseudo-label alignment pairs empowered with conflict-aware optimal transport (OT) modeling to boost the precision of entity alignment. CPL-OT is composed of two key components -- entity embedding learning with global-local aggregation and iterative conflict-aware pseudo labeling -- that mutually reinforce each other. To mitigate alignment conflicts during pseudo labeling, we propose to use optimal transport as an effective means to warrant one-to-one entity alignment between two KGs with the minimal overall transport cost. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of CPL-OT over state-of-the-art baselines under both settings with and without prior alignment seeds.

Abstract: Learning distributed representations, or embeddings, that encode the relational similarity patterns among objects is a relevant task in machine learning. A popular method to learn the embedding matrices $X, Y$ is optimizing a loss function of the term ${\rm SoftMax}(XY^T)$. The complexity required to calculate this term, however, runs quadratically with the problem size, making it a computationally heavy solution. In this article, we propose a linear-time heuristic approximation to compute the normalization constants of ${\rm SoftMax}(XY^T)$ for embedding vectors with bounded norms. We show on some pre-trained embedding datasets that the proposed estimation method achieves higher or comparable accuracy with competing methods. From this result, we design an efficient and task-agnostic algorithm that learns the embeddings by optimizing the cross entropy between the softmax and a set of probability distributions given as inputs. The proposed algorithm is interpretable and easily adapted to arbitrary embedding problems. We consider a few use cases and observe similar or higher performances and a lower computational time than similar ``2Vec'' algorithms.

Abstract: Over the last decades, deep neural networks based-models became the dominant paradigm in machine learning. Further, the use of artificial neural networks in symbolic learning has been seen as increasingly relevant recently. To study the capabilities of neural networks in the symbolic AI domain, researchers have explored the ability of deep neural networks to learn mathematical constructions, such as addition and multiplication, logic inference, such as theorem provers, and even the execution of computer programs. The latter is known to be too complex a task for neural networks. Therefore, the results were not always successful, and often required the introduction of biased elements in the learning process, in addition to restricting the scope of possible programs to be executed. In this work, we will analyze the ability of neural networks to learn how to execute programs as a whole. To do so, we propose a different approach. Instead of using an imperative programming language, with complex structures, we use the Lambda Calculus ({\lambda}-Calculus), a simple, but Turing-Complete mathematical formalism, which serves as the basis for modern functional programming languages and is at the heart of computability theory. We will introduce the use of integrated neural learning and lambda calculi formalization. Finally, we explore execution of a program in {\lambda}-Calculus is based on reductions, we will show that it is enough to learn how to perform these reductions so that we can execute any program.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by frequently changing motor symptoms, necessitating continuous symptom monitoring for more targeted treatment. Classical time series classification and deep learning techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in monitoring PD symptoms using wearable accelerometer data due to complex PD movement patterns and the small size of available datasets. We investigate InceptionTime and RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) as they are promising for PD symptom monitoring. InceptionTime's high learning capacity is well-suited to modeling complex movement patterns, while ROCKET is suited to small datasets. With random search methodology, we identify the highest-scoring InceptionTime architecture and compare its performance to ROCKET with a ridge classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on wrist motion data from PD patients. Our findings indicate that all approaches can learn to estimate tremor severity and bradykinesia presence with moderate performance but encounter challenges in detecting dyskinesia. Among the presented approaches, ROCKET demonstrates higher scores in identifying dyskinesia, whereas InceptionTime exhibits slightly better performance in tremor and bradykinesia estimation. Notably, both methods outperform the multi-layer perceptron. In conclusion, InceptionTime can classify complex wrist motion time series and holds potential for continuous symptom monitoring in PD with further development.

Abstract: In supervised learning, decision trees are valued for their interpretability and performance. While greedy decision tree algorithms like CART remain widely used due to their computational efficiency, they often produce sub-optimal solutions with respect to a regularized training loss. Conversely, optimal decision tree methods can find better solutions but are computationally intensive and typically limited to shallow trees or binary features. We present Dynamic Programming Decision Trees (DPDT), a framework that bridges the gap between greedy and optimal approaches. DPDT relies on a Markov Decision Process formulation combined with heuristic split generation to construct near-optimal decision trees with significantly reduced computational complexity. Our approach dynamically limits the set of admissible splits at each node while directly optimizing the tree regularized training loss. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DPDT can minimize regularized training losses at least as well as CART. Our empirical study shows on multiple datasets that DPDT achieves near-optimal loss with orders of magnitude fewer operations than existing optimal solvers. More importantly, extensive benchmarking suggests statistically significant improvements of DPDT over both CART and optimal decision trees in terms of generalization to unseen data. We demonstrate DPDT practicality through applications to boosting, where it consistently outperforms baselines. Our framework provides a promising direction for developing efficient, near-optimal decision tree algorithms that scale to practical applications.

Abstract: The capability of generalization is a cornerstone for the success of modern learning systems. For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes AdvDIFFormer, a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of online sequence learning for decision making under uncertainty in non-stationary, partially observable environments. The proposed algorithm, Distributed Hebbian Temporal Memory (DHTM), is based on the factor graph formalism and a multi-component neuron model. DHTM aims to capture sequential data relationships and make cumulative predictions about future observations, forming Successor Features (SFs). Inspired by neurophysiological models of the neocortex, the algorithm uses distributed representations, sparse transition matrices, and local Hebbian-like learning rules to overcome the instability and slow learning of traditional temporal memory algorithms such as RNN and HMM. Experimental results show that DHTM outperforms LSTM, RWKV and a biologically inspired HMM-like algorithm, CSCG, on non-stationary data sets. Our results suggest that DHTM is a promising approach to address the challenges of online sequence learning and planning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) often represent conflicts between features, arising naturally during training as the network learns to integrate diverse and potentially disagreeing inputs to better predict the target variable. Despite their relevance to the ``reasoning'' processes of these models, the properties and implications of conflicts for understanding and explaining ANNs remain underexplored. In this paper, we develop a rigorous theory of conflicts in ANNs and demonstrate their impact on ANN explainability through two case studies. In the first case study, we use our theory of conflicts to inspire the design of a novel feature attribution method, which we call Conflict-Aware Feature-wise Explanations (CAFE). CAFE separates the positive and negative influences of features and biases, enabling more faithful explanations for models applied to tabular data. In the second case study, we take preliminary steps towards understanding the role of conflicts in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Through our experiments, we identify potentially useful connections between model conflicts and different kinds of distributional shifts in tabular and image data. Overall, our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for conflicts in the development of more reliable explanation methods for AI systems, which are crucial for the beneficial use of these systems in the society.

Abstract: Dataset distillation offers a potential means to enhance data efficiency in deep learning. Recent studies have shown its ability to counteract backdoor risks present in original training samples. In this study, we delve into the theoretical aspects of backdoor attacks and dataset distillation based on kernel methods. We introduce two new theory-driven trigger pattern generation methods specialized for dataset distillation. Following a comprehensive set of analyses and experiments, we show that our optimization-based trigger design framework informs effective backdoor attacks on dataset distillation. Notably, datasets poisoned by our designed trigger prove resilient against conventional backdoor attack detection and mitigation methods. Our empirical results validate that the triggers developed using our approaches are proficient at executing resilient backdoor attacks.

Abstract: In this work, we study the properties of sampling sets on families of large graphs by leveraging the theory of graphons and graph limits. To this end, we extend to graphon signals the notion of removable and uniqueness sets, which was developed originally for the analysis of signals on graphs. We state the formal definition of a $\Lambda-$removable set and conditions under which a bandlimited graphon signal can be represented in a unique way when its samples are obtained from the complement of a given $\Lambda-$removable set in the graphon. By leveraging such results we show that graphon representations of graphs and graph signals can be used as a common framework to compare sampling sets between graphs with different numbers of nodes and edges, and different node labelings. Additionally, given a sequence of graphs that converges to a graphon, we show that the sequences of sampling sets whose graphon representation is identical in $[0,1]$ are convergent as well. We exploit the convergence results to provide an algorithm that obtains approximately close to optimal sampling sets. Performing a set of numerical experiments, we evaluate the quality of these sampling sets. Our results open the door for the efficient computation of optimal sampling sets in graphs of large size.

Abstract: Federated clustering, an essential extension of centralized clustering for federated scenarios, enables multiple data-holding clients to collaboratively group data while keeping their data locally. In centralized scenarios, clustering driven by representation learning has made significant advancements in handling high-dimensional complex data. However, the combination of federated clustering and representation learning remains underexplored. To bridge this, we first tailor a cluster-contrastive model for learning clustering-friendly representations. Then, we harness this model as the foundation for proposing a new federated clustering method, named cluster-contrastive federated clustering (CCFC). Benefiting from representation learning, the clustering performance of CCFC even double those of the best baseline methods in some cases. Compared to the most related baseline, the benefit results in substantial NMI score improvements of up to 0.4155 on the most conspicuous case. Moreover, CCFC also shows superior performance in handling device failures from a practical viewpoint.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized various domains, offering predictive capabilities in several areas. However, with the increasing accessibility of ML tools, many practitioners, lacking deep ML expertise, adopt a "push the button" approach, utilizing user-friendly interfaces without a thorough understanding of underlying algorithms. While this approach provides convenience, it raises concerns about the reliability of outcomes, leading to challenges such as incorrect performance evaluation. This paper addresses a critical issue in ML, known as data leakage, where unintended information contaminates the training data, impacting model performance evaluation. Users, due to a lack of understanding, may inadvertently overlook crucial steps, leading to optimistic performance estimates that may not hold in real-world scenarios. The discrepancy between evaluated and actual performance on new data is a significant concern. In particular, this paper categorizes data leakage in ML, discussing how certain conditions can propagate through the ML workflow. Furthermore, it explores the connection between data leakage and the specific task being addressed, investigates its occurrence in Transfer Learning, and compares standard inductive ML with transductive ML frameworks. The conclusion summarizes key findings, emphasizing the importance of addressing data leakage for robust and reliable ML applications.

Abstract: Recent developments in generative modeling have utilized score-based methods coupled with stochastic differential equations to sample from complex probability distributions. However, these and other performant sampling methods generally require gradients of the target probability distribution, which can be unavailable or computationally prohibitive in many scientific and engineering applications. Here, we introduce ensembles within score-based sampling methods to develop gradient-free approximate sampling techniques that leverage the collective dynamics of particle ensembles to compute approximate reverse diffusion drifts. We introduce the underlying methodology, emphasizing its relationship with generative diffusion models and the previously introduced F\"ollmer sampler. We demonstrate the efficacy of the ensemble strategies through various examples, ranging from low- to medium-dimensionality sampling problems, including multi-modal and highly non-Gaussian probability distributions, and provide comparisons to traditional methods like the No-U-Turn Sampler. Additionally, we showcase these strategies in the context of a high-dimensional Bayesian inversion problem within the geophysical sciences. Our findings highlight the potential of ensemble strategies for modeling complex probability distributions in situations where gradients are unavailable.

Abstract: Pretraining on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown great power in facilitating various downstream tasks. As pretraining generally requires huge amount of data and computational resources, the pretrained GNNs are high-value Intellectual Properties (IP) of the legitimate owner. However, adversaries may illegally copy and deploy the pretrained GNN models for their downstream tasks. Though initial efforts have been made to watermark GNN classifiers for IP protection, these methods require the target classification task for watermarking, and thus are not applicable to self-supervised pretraining of GNN models. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework named PreGIP to watermark the pretraining of GNN encoder for IP protection while maintain the high-quality of the embedding space. PreGIP incorporates a task-free watermarking loss to watermark the embedding space of pretrained GNN encoder. A finetuning-resistant watermark injection is further deployed. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of {\method} in IP protection and maintaining high-performance for downstream tasks.

Abstract: In many classification applications, the prediction of a deep neural network (DNN) based classifier needs to be accompanied by some confidence indication. Two popular approaches for that aim are: 1) Calibration: modifies the classifier's softmax values such that the maximal value better estimates the correctness probability; and 2) Conformal Prediction (CP): produces a prediction set of candidate labels that contains the true label with a user-specified probability, guaranteeing marginal coverage but not, e.g., per class coverage. In practice, both types of indications are desirable, yet, so far the interplay between them has not been investigated. Focusing on the ubiquitous Temperature Scaling (TS) calibration, we start this paper with an extensive empirical study of its effect on prominent CP methods. We show that while TS calibration improves the class-conditional coverage of adaptive CP methods, surprisingly, it negatively affects their prediction set sizes. Motivated by this behavior, we explore the effect of TS on CP beyond its calibration application and reveal an intriguing trend under which it allows to trade prediction set size and conditional coverage of adaptive CP methods. Then, we establish a mathematical theory that explains the entire non-monotonic trend. Finally, based on our experiments and theory, we offer simple guidelines for practitioners to effectively combine adaptive CP with calibration, aligned with user-defined goals.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the promise of coupling machine learning methods and physical domain-specific insights for solving scientific problems based on partial differential equations (PDEs). However, being data-intensive, these methods still require a large amount of PDE data. This reintroduces the need for expensive numerical PDE solutions, partially undermining the original goal of avoiding these expensive simulations. In this work, seeking data efficiency, we design unsupervised pretraining for PDE operator learning. To reduce the need for training data with heavy simulation costs, we mine unlabeled PDE data without simulated solutions, and we pretrain neural operators with physics-inspired reconstruction-based proxy tasks. To improve out-of-distribution performance, we further assist neural operators in flexibly leveraging a similarity-based method that learns in-context examples, without incurring extra training costs or designs. Extensive empirical evaluations on a diverse set of PDEs demonstrate that our method is highly data-efficient, more generalizable, and even outperforms conventional vision-pretrained models. We provide our code at https://github.com/delta-lab-ai/data_efficient_nopt.

Abstract: Data standardization is a crucial part of the data science life cycle. While tools like Pandas offer robust functionalities, their complexity and the manual effort required for customizing code to diverse column types pose significant challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language understanding and code generation, it still demands expert-level programming knowledge and continuous interaction for prompt refinement. To solve these challenges, our key idea is to propose a Python library with declarative, unified APIs for standardizing different column types, simplifying the LLM's code generation with concise API calls. We first propose Dataprep.Clean, a component of the Dataprep Python Library, significantly reduces the coding complexity by enabling the standardization of specific column types with a single line of code. Then, we introduce the CleanAgent framework integrating Dataprep.Clean and LLM-based agents to automate the data standardization process. With CleanAgent, data scientists only need to provide their requirements once, allowing for a hands-free process. To demonstrate the practical utility of CleanAgent, we developed a user-friendly web application, allowing users to interact with it using real-world datasets.

Abstract: Signature kernels, inner products of path signatures, underpin several machine learning algorithms for multivariate time series analysis. For bounded variation paths, signature kernels were recently shown to solve a Goursat PDE. However, existing PDE solvers only use increments as input data, leading to first order approximation errors. These approaches become computationally intractable for highly oscillatory input paths, as they have to be resolved at a fine enough scale to accurately recover their signature kernel, resulting in significant time and memory complexities. In this paper, we extend the analysis to rough paths, and show, leveraging the framework of smooth rough paths, that the resulting rough signature kernels can be approximated by a novel system of PDEs whose coefficients involve higher order iterated integrals of the input rough paths. We show that this system of PDEs admits a unique solution and establish quantitative error bounds yielding a higher order approximation to rough signature kernels.

Abstract: Convection (thunderstorm) develops rapidly within hours and is highly destructive, posing a significant challenge for nowcasting and resulting in substantial losses to nature and society. After the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, convection nowcasting has experienced rapid advancements, with its performance surpassing that of physics-based numerical weather prediction and other conventional approaches. However, the lead time and coverage of it still leave much to be desired and hardly meet the needs of disaster emergency response. Here, we propose deep diffusion models of satellite (DDMS) to establish an AI-based convection nowcasting system. Specifically, DDMS employs diffusion processes to effectively simulate complicated spatiotemporal evolution patterns of convective clouds, significantly improving the forecast lead time. Additionally, it combines geostationary satellite brightness temperature data and domain knowledge from meteorological experts, thereby achieving planetary-scale forecast coverage. During long-term tests and objective validation based on the FengYun-4A satellite, our system achieves, for the first time, effective convection nowcasting up to 4 hours, with broad coverage (about 20,000,000 km$^2$), remarkable accuracy, and high resolution (15 minutes; 4 km). Its performance reaches a new height in convection nowcasting compared to the existing models. In terms of application, our system is highly transferable with the potential to collaborate with multiple satellites for global convection nowcasting. Furthermore, our results highlight the remarkable capabilities of diffusion models in convective clouds forecasting, as well as the significant value of geostationary satellite data when empowered by AI technologies.

Abstract: In this study, we consider the infinitely many-armed bandit problems in a rested rotting setting, where the mean reward of an arm may decrease with each pull, while otherwise, it remains unchanged. We explore two scenarios regarding the rotting of rewards: one in which the cumulative amount of rotting is bounded by $V_T$, referred to as the slow-rotting case, and the other in which the cumulative number of rotting instances is bounded by $S_T$, referred to as the abrupt-rotting case. To address the challenge posed by rotting rewards, we introduce an algorithm that utilizes UCB with an adaptive sliding window, designed to manage the bias and variance trade-off arising due to rotting rewards. Our proposed algorithm achieves tight regret bounds for both slow and abrupt rotting scenarios. Lastly, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using numerical experiments.

<title>Bypassing Skip-Gram Negative Sampling: Dimension Regularization as a More Efficient Alternative for Graph Embeddings</title>

Abstract: A wide range of graph embedding objectives decompose into two components: one that enforces similarity, attracting the embeddings of nodes that are perceived as similar, and another that enforces dissimilarity, repelling the embeddings of nodes that are perceived as dissimilar. Without repulsion, the embeddings would collapse into trivial solutions. Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) is a popular and efficient repulsion approach that prevents collapse by repelling each node from a sample of dissimilar nodes. In this work, we show that when repulsion is most needed and the embeddings approach collapse, SGNS node-wise repulsion is, in the aggregate, an approximate re-centering of the node embedding dimensions. Such dimension operations are more scalable than node operations and produce a simpler geometric interpretation of the repulsion. Our theoretical result establishes dimension regularization as an effective and more efficient, compared to skip-gram node contrast, approach to enforcing dissimilarity among embeddings of nodes. We use this result to propose a flexible algorithm augmentation framework that improves the scalability of any existing algorithm using SGNS. The framework prioritizes node attraction and replaces SGNS with dimension regularization. We instantiate this generic framework for LINE and node2vec and show that the augmented algorithms preserve downstream link-prediction performance while reducing GPU memory usage by up to 33.3% and training time by 23.4%. Moreover, we show that completely removing repulsion (a special case of our augmentation framework) in LINE reduces training time by 70.9% on average, while increasing link prediction performance, especially for graphs that are globally sparse but locally dense. In general, however, repulsion is needed, and dimension regularization provides an efficient alternative to SGNS.

<title>How to set AdamW's weight decay as you scale model and dataset size</title>

Abstract: The scaling of the optimal AdamW weight decay hyperparameter with model and dataset size is critical as we seek to build larger models, but is poorly understood. We show that weights learned by AdamW can be understood as an exponential moving average (EMA) of recent updates. This gives critical insights for how to set the weight decay in AdamW, and how the weight decay should scale with model and dataset size. In particular, the key hyperparameter for an exponential moving average is the EMA timescale. Intuitively, the EMA timescale can be understood as the number of recent iterations the EMA averages over. We find that the optimal timescale, measured in epochs, is roughly constant as we change model and dataset size. Moreover, given a learning rate, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EMA timescale to the weight decay hyperparameter. Thus, if the optimal EMA timescale is constant, that implies that as the dataset size increases, the optimal weight decay should fall and as the model size increases, the optimal weight decay should increase (if we follow the muP recommendation for scaling the learning rate). We validate these scaling rules on ResNet-18 and Vision Transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and on NanoGPT pre-training on OpenWebText. Finally, we found that as training progresses, muP's learning rate scaling breaks down for AdamW unless weight decay is scaled appropriately.

This method falls within the realm of adaptive sub-gradient techniques, yet the underlying geometric principles guiding its performance have remained shrouded in mystery, and have long confounded researchers. In this paper, we introduce GeoAdaLer (Geometric Adaptive Learner), a novel adaptive learning method for stochastic gradient descent optimization, which draws from the geometric properties of the optimization landscape. Beyond emerging as a formidable contender, the proposed method extends the concept of adaptive learning by introducing a geometrically inclined approach that enhances the interpretability and effectiveness in complex optimization scenarios

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel conformal prediction method for time-series, which we call Kernel-based Optimally Weighted Conformal Prediction Intervals (KOWCPI). Specifically, KOWCPI adapts the classic Reweighted Nadaraya-Watson (RNW) estimator for quantile regression on dependent data and learns optimal data-adaptive weights. Theoretically, we tackle the challenge of establishing a conditional coverage guarantee for non-exchangeable data under strong mixing conditions on the non-conformity scores. We demonstrate the superior performance of KOWCPI on real and synthetic time-series data against state-of-the-art methods, where KOWCPI achieves narrower confidence intervals without losing coverage.

Abstract: With the emergence of diffusion models as a frontline generative model, many researchers have proposed molecule generation techniques with conditional diffusion models. However, the unavoidable discreteness of a molecule makes it difficult for a diffusion model to connect raw data with highly complex conditions like natural language. To address this, here we present a novel latent diffusion model dubbed LDMol for text-conditioned molecule generation. By recognizing that the suitable latent space design is the key to the diffusion model performance, we employ a contrastive learning strategy to extract novel feature space from text data that embeds the unique characteristics of the molecule structure. Experiments show that LDMol outperforms the existing autoregressive baselines on the text-to-molecule generation benchmark, being one of the first diffusion models that outperforms autoregressive models in textual data generation with a better choice of the latent domain. Furthermore, we show that LDMol can be applied to downstream tasks such as molecule-to-text retrieval and text-guided molecule editing, demonstrating its versatility as a diffusion model.

Abstract: The calibration of constitutive models from full-field data has recently gained increasing interest due to improvements in full-field measurement capabilities. In addition to the experimental characterization of novel materials, continuous structural health monitoring is another application that is of great interest. However, monitoring is usually associated with severe time constraints, difficult to meet with standard numerical approaches. Therefore, parametric physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for constitutive model calibration from full-field displacement data are investigated. In an offline stage, a parametric PINN can be trained to learn a parameterized solution of the underlying partial differential equation. In the subsequent online stage, the parametric PINN then acts as a surrogate for the parameters-to-state map in calibration. We test the proposed approach for the deterministic least-squares calibration of a linear elastic as well as a hyperelastic constitutive model from noisy synthetic displacement data. We further carry out Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty. A proper statistical evaluation of the results underlines the high accuracy of the deterministic calibration and that the estimated uncertainty is valid. Finally, we consider experimental data and show that the results are in good agreement with a finite element method-based calibration. Due to the fast evaluation of PINNs, calibration can be performed in near real-time. This advantage is particularly evident in many-query applications such as Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference.

Abstract: The Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) is a probabilistic framework in which an agent learns a stochastic policy and flow functions to sample objects proportionally to an unnormalized reward function. A number of recent works explored connections between GFlowNets and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) RL, which modifies the standard objective of RL agents by learning an entropy-regularized objective. However, the relationship between GFlowNets and standard RL remains largely unexplored, despite the inherent similarities in their sequential decision-making nature. While GFlowNets can discover diverse solutions through specialized flow-matching objectives, connecting them can simplify their implementation through established RL principles and improve RL's diverse solution discovery capabilities. In this paper, we bridge this gap by revealing a fundamental connection between GFlowNets and one RL's most basic components -- policy evaluation. Surprisingly, we find that the value function obtained from evaluating a uniform policy is closely associated with the flow functions in GFlowNets through the lens of flow iteration under certain structural conditions. Building upon these insights, we introduce a rectified random policy evaluation (RPE) algorithm, which achieves the same reward-matching effect as GFlowNets based on simply evaluating a fixed random policy in these cases, offering a new perspective. Empirical results across extensive benchmarks demonstrate that RPE achieves competitive results compared to previous approaches, shedding light on the previously overlooked connection between (non-MaxEnt) RL and GFlowNets.

Abstract: The past few years have seen remarkable progress in the decoding of speech from brain activity, primarily driven by large single-subject datasets. However, due to individual variation, such as anatomy, and differences in task design and scanning hardware, leveraging data across subjects and datasets remains challenging. In turn, the field has not benefited from the growing number of open neural data repositories to exploit large-scale deep learning. To address this, we develop neuroscience-informed self-supervised objectives, together with an architecture, for learning from heterogeneous brain recordings. Scaling to nearly 400 hours of MEG data and 900 subjects, our approach shows generalisation across participants, datasets, tasks, and even to novel subjects. It achieves improvements of 15-27% over state-of-the-art models and matches surgical decoding performance with non-invasive data. These advances unlock the potential for scaling speech decoding models beyond the current frontier.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to Explainable AI (XAI) that combines contrastive explanations with differential privacy for clustering algorithms. Focusing on k-median and k-means problems, we calculate contrastive explanations as the utility difference between original clustering and clustering with a centroid fixed to a specific data point. This method provides personalized insights into centroid placement. Our key contribution is demonstrating that these differentially private explanations achieve essentially the same utility bounds as non-private explanations. Experiments across various datasets show that our approach offers meaningful, privacy-preserving, and individually relevant explanations without significantly compromising clustering utility. This work advances privacy-aware machine learning by balancing data protection, explanation quality, and personalization in clustering tasks.

Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.

Abstract: The impressive multimodal capabilities demonstrated by OpenAI's GPT-4 have generated significant interest in the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Visual instruction tuning of MLLMs with machine-generated instruction-following data has shown to enhance zero-shot capabilities across various tasks. However, there has been limited exploration into controlling the quality of the instruction data.Current methodologies for data selection in MLLMs often rely on single, unreliable scores or use downstream tasks for selection, which is time-consuming and can lead to potential overfitting on the chosen evaluation datasets. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel data selection methodology that utilizes image-text correlation and model perplexity to evaluate and select data of varying quality. This approach leverages the distinct distribution of these two attributes, mapping data quality into a two-dimensional space that allows for the selection of data based on their location within this distribution. By utilizing this space, we can analyze the impact of task type settings, used as prompts, on data quality. Additionally, this space can be used to construct multi-stage subsets of varying quality to facilitate curriculum learning. Our research includes comprehensive experiments conducted on various datasets. The results emphasize substantial enhancements in five commonly assessed capabilities compared to using the complete dataset. Our codes, data, and models are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EHIT-31B4

Abstract: We study the gradient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) in the over-parameterized setting, where a general GMM with $n>1$ components learns from data that are generated by a single ground truth Gaussian distribution. While results for the special case of 2-Gaussian mixtures are well-known, a general global convergence analysis for arbitrary $n$ remains unresolved and faces several new technical barriers since the convergence becomes sub-linear and non-monotonic. To address these challenges, we construct a novel likelihood-based convergence analysis framework and rigorously prove that gradient EM converges globally with a sublinear rate $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. This is the first global convergence result for Gaussian mixtures with more than $2$ components. The sublinear convergence rate is due to the algorithmic nature of learning over-parameterized GMM with gradient EM. We also identify a new emerging technical challenge for learning general over-parameterized GMM: the existence of bad local regions that can trap gradient EM for an exponential number of steps.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Conditional Probability (NCP), an operator-theoretic approach to learning conditional distributions with a focus on statistical inference tasks. NCP can be used to build conditional confidence regions and extract key statistics such as conditional quantiles, mean, and covariance. It offers streamlined learning via a single unconditional training phase, allowing efficient inference without the need for retraining even when conditioning changes. By leveraging the approximation capabilities of neural networks, NCP efficiently handles a wide variety of com- plex probability distributions. We provide theoretical guarantees that ensure both optimization consistency and statistical accuracy. In experiments, we show that NCP with a 2-hidden-layer network matches or outperforms leading methods. This demonstrates that a a minimalistic architecture with a theoretically grounded loss can achieve competitive results, even in the face of more complex architectures.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a text embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on a well-established time series classification benchmark. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging text embedding models to encode time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.

Abstract: We investigate the differential privacy (DP) guarantees under the hidden state assumption (HSA) for multi-convex problems. Recent analyses of privacy loss under the hidden state assumption have relied on strong assumptions such as convexity, thereby limiting their applicability to practical problems. In this paper, we introduce the Differential Privacy Mini-Batch Block Coordinate Descent (DP-MBCD) algorithm, accompanied by the privacy loss accounting methods under the hidden state assumption. Our proposed methods apply to a broad range of classical non-convex problems which are or can be converted to multi-convex problems, such as matrix factorization and neural network training. In addition to a tighter bound for privacy loss, our theoretical analysis is also compatible with proximal gradient descent and adaptive calibrated noise scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents FlashNorm, which is an exact but faster implementation of RMSNorm followed by linear layers. RMSNorm is used by many LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, and OpenELM. FlashNorm also speeds up Layer Normalization and its recently proposed replacement Dynamic Tanh (DyT) arXiv:2503.10622. FlashNorm also reduces the number of parameter tensors by simply merging the normalization weights with the weights of the next linear layer.

Abstract: The Value Iteration (VI) algorithm is an iterative procedure to compute the value function of a Markov decision process, and is the basis of many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms as well. As the error convergence rate of VI as a function of iteration $k$ is $O(\gamma^k)$, it is slow when the discount factor $\gamma$ is close to $1$. To accelerate the computation of the value function, we propose Deflated Dynamics Value Iteration (DDVI). DDVI uses matrix splitting and matrix deflation techniques to effectively remove (deflate) the top $s$ dominant eigen-structure of the transition matrix $\mathcal{P}^{\pi}$. We prove that this leads to a $\tilde{O}(\gamma^k |\lambda_{s+1}|^k)$ convergence rate, where $\lambda_{s+1}$is $(s+1)$-th largest eigenvalue of the dynamics matrix. We then extend DDVI to the RL setting and present Deflated Dynamics Temporal Difference (DDTD) algorithm. We empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) allows models to learn interactively from user feedback. This paper introduces a counterfactual data augmentation approach to AL, particularly addressing the selection of datapoints for user querying, a pivotal concern in enhancing data efficiency. Our approach is inspired by Variation Theory, a theory of human concept learning that emphasizes the essential features of a concept by focusing on what stays the same and what changes. Instead of just querying with existing datapoints, our approach synthesizes artificial datapoints that highlight potential key similarities and differences among labels using a neuro-symbolic pipeline combining large language models (LLMs) and rule-based models. Through an experiment in the example domain of text classification, we show that our approach achieves significantly higher performance when there are fewer annotated data. As the annotated training data gets larger the impact of the generated data starts to diminish showing its capability to address the cold start problem in AL. This research sheds light on integrating theories of human learning into the optimization of AL.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of neural state estimation in power distribution systems. We identified a research gap in the current state of the art, which lies in the inability of models to adapt to changes in the power grid, such as loss of sensors and branch switching, in a zero-shot fashion. Based on the literature, we identified graph neural networks as the most promising class of models for this use case. Our experiments confirm their robustness to some grid changes and also show that a deeper network does not always perform better. We propose data augmentations to improve performance and conduct a comprehensive grid search of different model configurations for common zero-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Unsupervised clustering has emerged as a critical tool for uncovering hidden patterns in vast, unlabeled datasets. However, traditional methods, such as Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), struggle with scalability owing to their quadratic computational complexity. To address this limitation, we introduce WOA-kMedoids, a novel unsupervised clustering method that incorporates the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), a nature-inspired metaheuristic inspired by the hunting strategies of humpback whales. By optimizing the centroid selection, WOA-kMedoids reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to near-linear with respect to the number of observations, enabling scalability to large datasets while maintaining high clustering accuracy. We evaluated WOA-kMedoids using 25 diverse time-series datasets from the UCR archive. Our empirical results show that WOA-kMedoids achieved a clustering performance comparable to PAM, with an average Rand Index (RI) of 0.731 compared to PAM's 0.739, outperforming PAM on 12 out of 25 datasets. While exhibiting a slightly higher runtime than PAM on small datasets (<300 observations), WOA-kMedoids outperformed PAM on larger datasets, with an average speedup of 1.7x and a maximum of 2.3x. The scalability of WOA-kMedoids, combined with its high accuracy, makes them a promising choice for unsupervised clustering in big data applications. This method has implications for efficient knowledge discovery in massive unlabeled datasets, particularly where traditional k-medoids methods are computationally infeasible, including IoT anomaly detection, biomedical signal analysis, and customer behavior clustering.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) heavily relies on the careful design of the reward function. However, accurately assigning rewards to each state-action pair in Long-Term Reinforcement Learning (LTRL) tasks remains a significant challenge. As a result, RL agents are often trained under expert guidance. Inspired by the ordinal utility theory in economics, we propose a novel reward estimation algorithm: ELO-Rating based Reinforcement Learning (ERRL). This approach features two key contributions. First, it uses expert preferences over trajectories rather than cardinal rewards (utilities) to compute the ELO rating of each trajectory as its reward. Second, a new reward redistribution algorithm is introduced to alleviate training instability in the absence of a fixed anchor reward. In long-term scenarios (up to 5000 steps), where traditional RL algorithms struggle, our method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how expert preferences influence the results.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) employ deep neural networks to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Deep operator network (DeepONet), a popular NO architecture, has demonstrated success in the real-time prediction of complex dynamics across various scientific and engineering applications. In this work, we introduce a random sampling technique to be adopted during the training of DeepONet, aimed at improving the generalization ability of the model, while significantly reducing the computational time. The proposed approach targets the trunk network of the DeepONet model that outputs the basis functions corresponding to the spatiotemporal locations of the bounded domain on which the physical system is defined. While constructing the loss function, DeepONet training traditionally considers a uniform grid of spatiotemporal points at which all the output functions are evaluated for each iteration. This approach leads to a larger batch size, resulting in poor generalization and increased memory demands, due to the limitations of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. The proposed random sampling over the inputs of the trunk net mitigates these challenges, improving generalization and reducing memory requirements during training, resulting in significant computational gains. We validate our hypothesis through three benchmark examples, demonstrating substantial reductions in training time while achieving comparable or lower overall test errors relative to the traditional training approach. Our results indicate that incorporating randomization in the trunk network inputs during training enhances the efficiency and robustness of DeepONet, offering a promising avenue for improving the framework's performance in modeling complex physical systems.

Abstract: Financial organizations collect a huge amount of temporal (sequential) data about clients, which is typically collected from multiple sources (modalities). Despite the urgent practical need, developing deep learning techniques suitable to handle such data is limited by the absence of large open-source multi-source real-world datasets of event sequences. To fill this gap, which is mainly caused by security reasons, we present the first industrial-scale publicly available multimodal banking dataset, MBD, that contains information on more than 2M corporate clients of a large bank. Clients are represented by several data sources: 950M bank transactions, 1B geo position events, 5M embeddings of dialogues with technical support, and monthly aggregated purchases of four bank products. All entries are properly anonymized from real proprietary bank data, and the experiments confirm that our anonymization still saves all significant information for introduced downstream tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel multimodal benchmark suggesting several important practical tasks, such as future purchase prediction and modality matching. The benchmark incorporates our MBD and two public financial datasets. We provide numerical results for the state-of-the-art event sequence modeling techniques including large language models and demonstrate the superiority of fusion baselines over single-modal techniques for each task. Thus, MBD provides a valuable resource for future research in financial applications of multimodal event sequence analysis.

Abstract: Speech pathology has impacts on communication abilities and quality of life. While deep learning-based models have shown potential in diagnosing these disorders, the use of sensitive data raises critical privacy concerns. Although differential privacy (DP) has been explored in the medical imaging domain, its application in pathological speech analysis remains largely unexplored despite the equally critical privacy concerns. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate DP's impact on pathological speech data, focusing on the trade-offs between privacy, diagnostic accuracy, and fairness. Using a large, real-world dataset of 200 hours of recordings from 2,839 German-speaking participants, we observed a maximum accuracy reduction of 3.85% when training with DP with high privacy levels. To highlight real-world privacy risks, we demonstrated the vulnerability of non-private models to gradient inversion attacks, reconstructing identifiable speech samples and showcasing DP's effectiveness in mitigating these risks. To explore the potential generalizability across languages and disorders, we validated our approach on a dataset of Spanish-speaking Parkinson's disease patients, leveraging pretrained models from healthy English-speaking datasets, and demonstrated that careful pretraining on large-scale task-specific datasets can maintain favorable accuracy under DP constraints. A comprehensive fairness analysis revealed minimal gender bias at reasonable privacy levels but underscored the need for addressing age-related disparities. Our results establish that DP can balance privacy and utility in speech disorder detection, while highlighting unique challenges in privacy-fairness trade-offs for speech data. This provides a foundation for refining DP methodologies and improving fairness across diverse patient groups in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization (MFBO) is a promising framework to speed up materials and molecular discovery as sources of information of different accuracies are at hand at increasing cost. Despite its potential use in chemical tasks, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the many parameters playing a role in MFBO. In this work, we provide guidelines and recommendations to decide when to use MFBO in experimental settings. We investigate MFBO methods applied to molecules and materials problems. First, we test two different families of acquisition functions in two synthetic problems and study the effect of the informativeness and cost of the approximate function. We use our implementation and guidelines to benchmark three real discovery problems and compare them against their single-fidelity counterparts. Our results may help guide future efforts to implement MFBO as a routine tool in the chemical sciences.

Abstract: A key property of reasoning systems is the ability to make sharp decisions on their input data. For contemporary AI systems, a key carrier of sharp behaviour is the softmax function, with its capability to perform differentiable query-key lookups. It is a common belief that the predictive power of networks leveraging softmax arises from "circuits" which sharply perform certain kinds of computations consistently across many diverse inputs. However, for these circuits to be robust, they would need to generalise well to arbitrary valid inputs. In this paper, we dispel this myth: even for tasks as simple as finding the maximum key, any learned circuitry must disperse as the number of items grows at test time. We attribute this to a fundamental limitation of the softmax function to robustly approximate sharp functions with increasing problem size, prove this phenomenon theoretically, and propose adaptive temperature as an ad-hoc technique for improving the sharpness of softmax at inference time.

Abstract: Learning conditional distributions $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$ is a central problem in machine learning, which is typically approached via supervised methods with paired data $(x,y) \sim \pi^*$. However, acquiring paired data samples is often challenging, especially in problems such as domain translation. This necessitates the development of $\textit{semi-supervised}$ models that utilize both limited paired data and additional unpaired i.i.d. samples $x \sim \pi^*_x$ and $y \sim \pi^*_y$ from the marginal distributions. The usage of such combined data is complex and often relies on heuristic approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose a new learning paradigm that integrates both paired and unpaired data $\textbf{seamlessly}$ using the data likelihood maximization techniques. We demonstrate that our approach also connects intriguingly with inverse entropic optimal transport (OT). This finding allows us to apply recent advances in computational OT to establish an $\textbf{end-to-end}$ learning algorithm to get $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$. In addition, we derive the universal approximation property, demonstrating that our approach can theoretically recover true conditional distributions with arbitrarily small error. Furthermore, we demonstrate through empirical tests that our method effectively learns conditional distributions using paired and unpaired data simultaneously.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is challenging because distribution shifts come in many forms. Numerous algorithms exist to address specific settings, but choosing the right training algorithm for the right dataset without trial and error is difficult. Indeed, real-world applications often involve multiple types and combinations of shifts that are hard to analyze theoretically.
  Method. This work explores the possibility of learning the selection of a training algorithm for OOD generalization. We propose a proof of concept (OOD-Chameleon) that formulates the selection as a multi-label classification over candidate algorithms, trained on a dataset of datasets representing a variety of shifts. We evaluate the ability of OOD-Chameleon to rank algorithms on unseen shifts and datasets based only on dataset characteristics, i.e., without training models first, unlike traditional model selection.
  Findings. Extensive experiments show that the learned selector identifies high-performing algorithms across synthetic, vision, and language tasks. Further inspection shows that it learns non-trivial decision rules, which provide new insights into the applicability of existing algorithms. Overall, this new approach opens the possibility of better exploiting and understanding the plethora of existing algorithms for OOD generalization.

Abstract: Frameworks and domain-specific languages for auto-generating code have traditionally depended on human experts to implement rigorous methods ensuring the legality of code transformations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has gained traction for generating code optimized for specific hardware targets. However, ML approaches-particularly black-box neural networks-offer no guarantees on the correctness or legality of the transformations they produce. To address this gap, we introduce Tadashi, an end-to-end system that leverages the polyhedral model to support researchers in curating datasets critical for ML-based code generation. Tadashi provides an end-to-end system capable of applying, verifying, and evaluating candidate transformations on polyhedral schedules with both reliability and practicality. We formally prove that Tadashi guarantees the legality of generated transformations, demonstrate its low runtime overhead, and showcase its broad applicability.

Abstract: LLM inference for enterprise applications, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observe much longer prompt than generations, leading to high prefill cost and response latency. We present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure targeted at reducing the prefill compute (in FLOPs) of prompt tokens while preserving high generation quality. First, SwiftKV prefills later layers' KV cache using an earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip those later layers. Second, SwiftKV employs a lightweight knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs with minimal accuracy impact. Third, SwiftKV can naturally incorporate KV cache compression to improve inference performance in low-memory scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments show that SwiftKV can effectively reduce prefill computation by 25-50% across several LLM families while incurring minimum quality degradation. In the end-to-end inference serving, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B. SwiftKV is open-sourced at https://github.com/snowflakedb/arctictraining.

Abstract: Pre-trained generalist policies are rapidly gaining relevance in robot learning due to their promise of fast adaptation to novel, in-domain tasks. This adaptation often relies on collecting new demonstrations for a specific task of interest and applying imitation learning algorithms, such as behavioral cloning. However, as soon as several tasks need to be learned, we must decide which tasks should be demonstrated and how often? We study this multi-task problem and explore an interactive framework in which the agent adaptively selects the tasks to be demonstrated. We propose AMF (Active Multi-task Fine-tuning), an algorithm to maximize multi-task policy performance under a limited demonstration budget by collecting demonstrations yielding the largest information gain on the expert policy. We derive performance guarantees for AMF under regularity assumptions and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness to efficiently fine-tune neural policies in complex and high-dimensional environments.

Abstract: Most federated learning (FL) approaches assume a fixed client set. However, real-world scenarios often involve clients dynamically joining or leaving the system based on their needs or interest in specific tasks. This dynamic setting introduces unique challenges: (1) the optimization objective evolves with the active client set, unlike traditional FL with a static objective; and (2) the current global model may no longer serve as an effective initialization for subsequent rounds, potentially hindering adaptation. To address these challenges, we first provide a convergence analysis under a non-convex loss with a dynamic client set, accounting for factors such as gradient noise, local training iterations, and data heterogeneity. Building on this analysis, we propose a model initialization algorithm that enables rapid adaptation to new client sets whenever clients join or leave the system. Our key idea is to compute a weighted average of previous global models, guided by gradient similarity, to prioritize models trained on data distributions that closely align with the current client set, thereby accelerating recovery from distribution shifts. This plug-and-play algorithm is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing FL methods, offering broad applicability in practice. Experimental results on diverse datasets including both image and text domains, varied label distributions, and multiple FL algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of scenarios.

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning often faces optimization challenges due to the complexity of solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which involve exploring large solution spaces, require numerous iterations, and can lead to unstable training. These challenges arise particularly from the ill-conditioning of the optimization problem caused by the differential terms in the loss function. To address these issues, we propose learning a solver, i.e., solving PDEs using a physics-informed iterative algorithm trained on data. Our method learns to condition a gradient descent algorithm that automatically adapts to each PDE instance, significantly accelerating and stabilizing the optimization process and enabling faster convergence of physics-aware models. Furthermore, while traditional physics-informed methods solve for a single PDE instance, our approach extends to parametric PDEs. Specifically, we integrate the physical loss gradient with PDE parameters, allowing our method to solve over a distribution of PDE parameters, including coefficients, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through empirical experiments on multiple datasets, comparing both training and test-time optimization performance. The code is available at https://github.com/2ailesB/neural-parametric-solver.

Abstract: The loss of plasticity in learning agents, analogous to the solidification of neural pathways in biological brains, significantly impedes learning and adaptation in reinforcement learning due to its non-stationary nature. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel approach, {\it Neuroplastic Expansion} (NE), inspired by cortical expansion in cognitive science. NE maintains learnability and adaptability throughout the entire training process by dynamically growing the network from a smaller initial size to its full dimension. Our method is designed with three key components: (\textit{1}) elastic topology generation based on potential gradients, (\textit{2}) dormant neuron pruning to optimize network expressivity, and (\textit{3}) neuron consolidation via experience review to strike a balance in the plasticity-stability dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NE effectively mitigates plasticity loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various tasks in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite environments. NE enables more adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments, which represents a crucial step towards transitioning deep reinforcement learning from static, one-time training paradigms to more flexible, continually adapting models.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability for large language models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks by leveraging a few (demonstration) examples. Despite its effectiveness, the mechanism behind ICL remains underexplored. To better understand how ICL integrates the examples with the knowledge learned by the LLM during pre-training (i.e., pre-training knowledge) and how the examples impact ICL, this paper conducts a theoretical study in binary classification tasks. In particular, we introduce a probabilistic model extending from the Gaussian mixture model to exactly quantify the impact of pre-training knowledge, label frequency, and label noise on the prediction accuracy. Based on our analysis, when the pre-training knowledge contradicts the knowledge in the examples, whether ICL prediction relies more on the pre-training knowledge or the examples depends on the number of examples. In addition, the label frequency and label noise of the examples both affect the accuracy of the ICL prediction, where the minor class has a lower accuracy, and how the label noise impacts the accuracy is determined by the specific noise level of the two classes. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the correctness of the theoretical results, and real-data experiments also align with the theoretical insights. Our work reveals the role of pre-training knowledge and examples in ICL, offering a deeper understanding of LLMs' behaviors in classification tasks.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a challenging task, particularly in the context of complex multiscale temporal patterns. This study presents LLM-Mixer, a framework that improves forecasting accuracy through the combination of multiscale time-series decomposition with pre-trained LLMs (Large Language Models). LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons. This work highlights the potential of combining multiscale analysis and LLMs for effective and scalable time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is essential in a variety of contemporary scientific fields, such as drug development and designing energy storage materials. Although there are many machine learning models available for this purpose, those that achieve high accuracy while also offering interpretability of predictions are uncommon. We present a graph neural network that not only matches the prediction accuracies of leading models but also provides insights on four levels of molecular substructures. This model helps identify which atoms, bonds, molecular fragments, and connections between fragments are significant for predicting a specific molecular property. Understanding the importance of connections between fragments is particularly valuable for molecules with substructures that do not connect through standard bonds. The model additionally can quantify the impact of specific fragments on the prediction, allowing the identification of fragments that may improve or degrade a property value. These interpretable features are essential for deriving scientific insights from the model's learned relationships between molecular structures and properties.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods typically assume that Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on data from a single device or client. However, real-world scenarios often require fine-tuning these models on private data distributed across multiple devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers an appealing solution by preserving user privacy, as sensitive data remains on local devices during training. Nonetheless, integrating PEFT methods into FL introduces two main challenges: communication overhead and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce FedTT and FedTT+, methods for adapting LLMs by integrating tensorized adapters into client-side models' encoder/decoder blocks. FedTT is versatile and can be applied to both cross-silo FL and large-scale cross-device FL. FedTT+, an extension of FedTT tailored for cross-silo FL, enhances robustness against data heterogeneity by adaptively freezing portions of tensor factors, further reducing the number of trainable parameters. Experiments on BERT and LLaMA models demonstrate that our proposed methods successfully address data heterogeneity challenges and perform on par or even better than existing federated PEFT approaches while achieving up to 10$\times$ reduction in communication cost.

Abstract: Recent research on explainable recommendation generally frames the task as a standard text generation problem, and evaluates models simply based on the textual similarity between the predicted and ground-truth explanations. However, this approach fails to consider one crucial aspect of the systems: whether their outputs accurately reflect the users' (post-purchase) sentiments, i.e., whether and why they would like and/or dislike the recommended items. To shed light on this issue, we introduce new datasets and evaluation methods that focus on the users' sentiments. Specifically, we construct the datasets by explicitly extracting users' positive and negative opinions from their post-purchase reviews using an LLM, and propose to evaluate systems based on whether the generated explanations 1) align well with the users' sentiments, and 2) accurately identify both positive and negative opinions of users on the target items. We benchmark several recent models on our datasets and demonstrate that achieving strong performance on existing metrics does not ensure that the generated explanations align well with the users' sentiments. Lastly, we find that existing models can provide more sentiment-aware explanations when the users' (predicted) ratings for the target items are directly fed into the models as input. The datasets and benchmark implementation are available at: https://github.com/jchanxtarov/sent_xrec.

Abstract: One of the biggest challenges of building artificial intelligence (AI) model in healthcare area is the data sharing. Since healthcare data is private, sensitive, and heterogeneous, collecting sufficient data for modelling is exhausted, costly, and sometimes impossible. In this paper, we propose a framework for global healthcare modelling using datasets from multi-continents (Europe, North America and Asia) while without sharing the local datasets, and choose glucose management as a study model to verify its effectiveness. Technically, blockchain-enabled federated learning is implemented with adaption to make it meet with the privacy and safety requirements of healthcare data, meanwhile rewards honest participation and penalize malicious activities using its on-chain incentive mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective, efficient, and privacy preserved. Its prediction accuracy is much better than the models trained from limited personal data and is similar to, and even slightly better than, the results from a centralized dataset. This work paves the way for international collaborations on healthcare projects, where additional data is crucial for reducing bias and providing benefits to humanity.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses key limitations of large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge, by incorporating external databases. These databases typically consult multiple sources to encompass up-to-date and various information. However, standard RAG methods often overlook the heterogeneous source reliability in the multi-source database and retrieve documents solely based on relevance, making them prone to propagating misinformation. To address this, we propose Reliability-Aware RAG (RA-RAG) which estimates the reliability of multiple sources and incorporates this information into both retrieval and aggregation processes. Specifically, it iteratively estimates source reliability and true answers for a set of queries with no labelling. Then, it selectively retrieves relevant documents from a few of reliable sources and aggregates them using weighted majority voting, where the selective retrieval ensures scalability while not compromising the performance. We also introduce a benchmark designed to reflect real-world scenarios with heterogeneous source reliability and demonstrate the effectiveness of RA-RAG compared to a set of baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, but aligning them with human preferences remains a core challenge. As individuals have their own, multi-dimensional preferences, recent studies have explored multi-dimensional personalization, which aims to enable models to generate responses personalized to explicit preferences. However, human preferences are often implicit and thus difficult to articulate, limiting the direct application of this approach. To bridge this gap, we propose Active Multi-dimensional Preference Learning (AMPLe), designed to capture implicit user preferences from interactively collected comparative feedback. Building on Bayesian inference, our work introduces a modified posterior update procedure to mitigate estimation bias and potential noise in comparisons. Also, inspired by generalized binary search, we employ an active query selection strategy to minimize the number of required comparisons by a user. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on language generation tasks, we demonstrate feedback efficiency and effectiveness of our framework in personalizing model responses. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ml-postech/AMPLe .

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generalized theory of convolutional signal processing and neural networks for Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Leveraging the theory of algebraic signal processing (ASP), we show that any RKHS allows the formal definition of multiple algebraic convolutional models. We show that any RKHS induces algebras whose elements determine convolutional operators acting on RKHS elements. This approach allows us to achieve scalable filtering and learning as a byproduct of the convolutional model, and simultaneously take advantage of the well-known benefits of processing information in an RKHS. To emphasize the generality and usefulness of our approach, we show how algebraic RKHS can be used to define convolutional signal models on groups, graphons, and traditional Euclidean signal spaces. Furthermore, using algebraic RKHS models, we build convolutional networks, formally defining the notion of pointwise nonlinearities and deriving explicit expressions for the training. Such derivations are obtained in terms of the algebraic representation of the RKHS. We present a set of numerical experiments on real data in which wireless coverage is predicted from measurements captured by unmaned aerial vehicles. This particular real-life scenario emphasizes the benefits of the convolutional RKHS models in neural networks compared to fully connected and standard convolutional operators.

<title>Zero-Shot Temporal Resolution Domain Adaptation for Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically-inspired deep neural networks that efficiently extract temporal information while offering promising gains in terms of energy efficiency and latency when deployed on neuromorphic devices. However, SNN model parameters are sensitive to temporal resolution, leading to significant performance drops when the temporal resolution of target data at the edge is not the same with that of the pre-deployment source data used for training, especially when fine-tuning is not possible at the edge. To address this challenge, we propose three novel domain adaptation methods for adapting neuron parameters to account for the change in time resolution without re-training on target time-resolution. The proposed methods are based on a mapping between neuron dynamics in SNNs and State Space Models (SSMs); and are applicable to general neuron models. We evaluate the proposed methods under spatio-temporal data tasks, namely the audio keyword spotting datasets SHD and MSWC as well as the image classification NMINST dataset. Our methods provide an alternative to - and in majority of the cases significantly outperform - the existing reference method that simply scales the time constant. Moreover, our results show that high accuracy on high temporal resolution data can be obtained by time efficient training on lower temporal resolution data and model adaptation.

Abstract: Differentiable rendering techniques like Gaussian Splatting and Neural Radiance Fields have become powerful tools for generating high-fidelity models of 3D objects and scenes. Their ability to produce both physically plausible and differentiable models of scenes are key ingredient needed to produce physically plausible adversarial attacks on DNNs. However, the adversarial machine learning community has yet to fully explore these capabilities, partly due to differing attack goals (e.g., misclassification, misdetection) and a wide range of possible scene manipulations used to achieve them (e.g., alter texture, mesh). This survey contributes the first framework that unifies diverse goals and tasks, facilitating easy comparison of existing work, identifying research gaps, and highlighting future directions - ranging from expanding attack goals and tasks to account for new modalities, state-of-the-art models, tools, and pipelines, to underscoring the importance of studying real-world threats in complex scenes.

Abstract: To balance the quality and inference cost of a Foundation Model (FM, such as large language models (LLMs)) powered software, people often opt to train a routing model that routes requests to FMs with different sizes and capabilities. Existing routing models rely on learning the optimal routing decision from carefully curated data, require complex computations to be updated, and do not consider the potential evolution of weaker FMs. In this paper, we propose Real-time Adaptive Routing (RAR), an approach to continuously adapt FM routing decisions while using guided in-context learning to enhance the capabilities of weaker FM. The goal is to reduce reliance on stronger, more expensive FMs. We evaluate our approach on different subsets of the popular MMLU benchmark. Over time, our approach routes 50.2% fewer requests to computationally expensive models while maintaining around 90.5% of the general response quality. In addition, the guides generated from stronger models have shown intra-domain generalization and led to a better quality of responses compared to an equivalent approach with a standalone weaker FM.

Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrices $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrices $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK^\top$. Third, we propose a two-level accumulation strategy for $\widetilde PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 4.5x on RTX4090, respectively. Moreover, SageAttention2 matches the speed of FlashAttention3(fp8) on the Hopper GPUs, while delivering much higher accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for language, image, and video generation. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

Abstract: Machine learning models are advancing circuit design, particularly in analog circuits. They typically generate netlists that lack human interpretability. This is a problem as human designers heavily rely on the interpretability of circuit diagrams or schematics to intuitively understand, troubleshoot, and develop designs. Hence, to integrate domain knowledge effectively, it is crucial to translate ML-generated netlists into interpretable schematics quickly and accurately. We propose Schemato, a large language model (LLM) for netlist-to-schematic conversion. In particular, we consider our approach in converting netlists to .asc files, text-based schematic description used in LTSpice. Experiments on our circuit dataset show that Schemato achieves up to 76% compilation success rate, surpassing 63% scored by the state-of-the-art LLMs. Furthermore, our experiments show that Schemato generates schematics with an average graph edit distance score and mean structural similarity index measure, scaled by the compilation success rate that are 1.8x and 4.3x higher than the best performing LLMs respectively, demonstrating its ability to generate schematics that are more accurately connected and are closer to the reference human design.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents significant challenges for large language models (LLMs). To enhance their capabilities, we propose Monte Carlo Self-Refine Tree (MC-NEST), an extension of Monte Carlo Tree Search that integrates LLM-based self-refinement and self-evaluation for improved decision-making in complex reasoning tasks. MC-NEST balances exploration and exploitation using Upper Confidence Bound (UCT) scores combined with diverse selection policies. Through iterative critique and refinement, LLMs learn to reason more strategically. Empirical results demonstrate that MC-NEST with an importance sampling policy substantially improves GPT-4o's performance, achieving state-of-the-art pass@1 scores on Olympiad-level benchmarks. Specifically, MC-NEST attains a pass@1 of 38.6 on AIME and 12.6 on MathOdyssey. The solution quality for MC-NEST using GPT-4o and Phi-3-mini reaches 84.0\% and 82.08\%, respectively, indicating robust consistency across different LLMs. MC-NEST performs strongly across Algebra, Geometry, and Number Theory, benefiting from its ability to handle abstraction, logical deduction, and multi-step reasoning -- core skills in mathematical problem solving.

Abstract: Recent advances in Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) have led to significant reductions in transcription errors on standard benchmarks under the i.i.d. assumption, thus focusing on minimizing in-distribution (ID) errors. However, this assumption does not hold in real-world applications, which has motivated HTR research to explore Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation techniques. In this work, we investigate the unaddressed limitations of HTR models in generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We adopt the challenging setting of Domain Generalization, where models are expected to generalize to OOD data without any prior access. To this end, we analyze 336 OOD cases from eight state-of-the-art HTR models across seven widely used datasets, spanning five languages. Additionally, we study how HTR models leverage synthetic data to generalize. We reveal that the most significant factor for generalization lies in the textual divergence between domains, followed by visual divergence. We demonstrate that the error of HTR models in OOD scenarios can be reliably estimated, with discrepancies falling below 10 points in 70\% of cases. We identify the underlying limitations of HTR models, laying the foundation for future research to address this challenge.

Abstract: While great success has been achieved in building vision models with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) over internet-scale image-text pairs, building transferable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with CLIP pipeline is challenging because of the scarcity of labeled data and text supervision, different levels of downstream tasks, and the conceptual gaps between domains. In this work, to address these issues, we propose a multi-modal prompt learning paradigm to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. We demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision. The code is available at https://github.com/Violet24K/Morpher.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) embed sensitive, human-generated data, prompting the need for unlearning methods. Although certified unlearning offers strong privacy guarantees, its restrictive assumptions make it unsuitable for LLMs, giving rise to various heuristic approaches typically assessed through empirical evaluations. These standard evaluations randomly select data for removal, apply unlearning techniques, and use membership inference attacks (MIAs) to compare unlearned models against models retrained without the removed data. However, to ensure robust privacy protections for every data point, it is essential to account for scenarios in which certain data subsets face elevated risks. Prior research suggests that outliers, particularly including data tied to minority groups, often exhibit higher memorization propensity which indicates they may be more difficult to unlearn. Building on these insights, we introduce a complementary, minority-aware evaluation framework to highlight blind spots in existing frameworks. We substantiate our findings with carefully designed experiments, using canaries with personally identifiable information (PII) to represent these minority subsets and demonstrate that they suffer at least 20% higher privacy leakage across various unlearning methods, MIAs, datasets, and LLM scales. Our proposed minority-aware evaluation framework marks an essential step toward more equitable and comprehensive assessments of LLM unlearning efficacy.

Abstract: Schrodinger Bridges (SBs) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture. The proposed method generalizes naturally to more general classes of dynamical systems, such as controllable linear time-varying systems, enabling efficient solutions to multi-marginal momentum SB between GMMs, a challenging distribution interpolation problem. We showcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, learning of cellular dynamics using multi-marginal momentum SB problems, and various other examples. We also test our approach on an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) benchmark problem and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cases where the boundary distributions are mixture models while requiring virtually no training.

Abstract: We introduce ResGen, an efficient Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)-based generative model for high-fidelity generation with fast sampling. RVQ improves data fidelity by increasing the number of quantization steps, referred to as depth, but deeper quantization typically increases inference steps in generative models. To address this, ResGen directly predicts the vector embedding of collective tokens rather than individual ones, ensuring that inference steps remain independent of RVQ depth. Additionally, we formulate token masking and multi-token prediction within a probabilistic framework using discrete diffusion and variational inference. We validate the efficacy and generalizability of the proposed method on two challenging tasks across different modalities: conditional image generation on ImageNet 256x256 and zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that ResGen outperforms autoregressive counterparts in both tasks, delivering superior performance without compromising sampling speed. Furthermore, as we scale the depth of RVQ, our generative models exhibit enhanced generation fidelity or faster sampling speeds compared to similarly sized baseline models.

Abstract: Causal discovery is an imperative foundation for decision-making across domains, such as smart health, AI for drug discovery and AIOps. Traditional statistical causal discovery methods, while well-established, predominantly rely on observational data and often overlook the semantic cues inherent in cause-and-effect relationships. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an affordable way of leveraging the semantic cues for knowledge-driven causal discovery, but the development of LLMs for causal discovery lags behind other areas, particularly in the exploration of multi-modal data. To bridge the gap, we introduce MATMCD, a multi-agent system powered by tool-augmented LLMs. MATMCD has two key agents: a Data Augmentation agent that retrieves and processes modality-augmented data, and a Causal Constraint agent that integrates multi-modal data for knowledge-driven reasoning. The proposed design of the inner-workings ensures successful cooperation of the agents. Our empirical study across seven datasets suggests the significant potential of multi-modality enhanced causal discovery.

Abstract: Distributionally robust policy learning aims to find a policy that performs well under the worst-case distributional shift, and yet most existing methods for robust policy learning consider the worst-case joint distribution of the covariate and the outcome. The joint-modeling strategy can be unnecessarily conservative when we have more information on the source of distributional shifts. This paper studies a more nuanced problem -- robust policy learning under the concept drift, when only the conditional relationship between the outcome and the covariate changes. To this end, we first provide a doubly-robust estimator for evaluating the worst-case average reward of a given policy under a set of perturbed conditional distributions. We show that the policy value estimator enjoys asymptotic normality even if the nuisance parameters are estimated with a slower-than-root-$n$ rate. We then propose a learning algorithm that outputs the policy maximizing the estimated policy value within a given policy class $\Pi$, and show that the sub-optimality gap of the proposed algorithm is of the order $\kappa(\Pi)n^{-1/2}$, where $\kappa(\Pi)$ is the entropy integral of $\Pi$ under the Hamming distance and $n$ is the sample size. A matching lower bound is provided to show the optimality of the rate. The proposed methods are implemented and evaluated in numerical studies, demonstrating substantial improvement compared with existing benchmarks.

Abstract: We study the repeated principal-agent bandit game, where the principal indirectly interacts with the unknown environment by proposing incentives for the agent to play arms. Most existing work assumes the agent has full knowledge of the reward means and always behaves greedily, but in many online marketplaces, the agent needs to learn the unknown environment and sometimes explore. Motivated by such settings, we model a self-interested learning agent with exploration behaviors who iteratively updates reward estimates and either selects an arm that maximizes the estimated reward plus incentive or explores arbitrarily with a certain probability. As a warm-up, we first consider a self-interested learning agent without exploration. We propose algorithms for both i.i.d. and linear reward settings with bandit feedback in a finite horizon $T$, achieving regret bounds of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ and $\widetilde{O}( T^{2/3} )$, respectively. Specifically, these algorithms are established upon a novel elimination framework coupled with newly-developed search algorithms which accommodate the uncertainty arising from the learning behavior of the agent. We then extend the framework to handle the exploratory learning agent and develop an algorithm to achieve a $\widetilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound in i.i.d. reward setup by enhancing the robustness of our elimination framework to the potential agent exploration. Finally, when reducing our agent behaviors to the one studied in (Dogan et al., 2023a), we propose an algorithm based on our robust framework, which achieves a $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, significantly improving upon their $\widetilde{O}(T^{11/12})$ bound.

Abstract: Flow matching (FM) models extend ODE sampler based diffusion models into a general framework, significantly reducing sampling steps through learned vector fields. However, the theoretical understanding of FM models, particularly how their sample trajectories interact with underlying data geometry, remains underexplored. A rigorous theoretical analysis of FM ODE is essential for sample quality, stability, and broader applicability. In this paper, we advance the theory of FM models through a comprehensive analysis of sample trajectories. Central to our theory is the discovery that the denoiser, a key component of FM models, guides ODE dynamics through attracting and absorbing behaviors that adapt to the data geometry. We identify and analyze the three stages of ODE evolution: in the initial and intermediate stages, trajectories move toward the mean and local clusters of the data. At the terminal stage, we rigorously establish the convergence of FM ODE under weak assumptions, addressing scenarios where the data lie on a low-dimensional submanifold-cases that previous results could not handle. Our terminal stage analysis offers insights into the memorization phenomenon and establishes equivariance properties of FM ODEs. These findings bridge critical gaps in understanding flow matching models, with practical implications for optimizing sampling strategies and architectures guided by the intrinsic geometry of data.

<title>Why Are Positional Encodings Nonessential for Deep Autoregressive Transformers? Revisiting a Petroglyph</title>

Abstract: Do autoregressive Transformer language models require explicit positional encodings (PEs)? The answer is 'no' provided they have more than one layer -- they can distinguish sequences with permuted tokens without the need for explicit PEs. This follows from the fact that a cascade of (permutation invariant) set processors can collectively exhibit sequence-sensitive behavior in the autoregressive setting. This property has been known since early efforts (contemporary with GPT-2) adopting the Transformer for language modeling. However, this result does not appear to have been well disseminated, leading to recent rediscoveries. This may be partially due to a sudden growth of the language modeling community after the advent of GPT-2/3, but perhaps also due to the lack of a clear explanation in prior work, despite being commonly understood by practitioners in the past. Here we review the long-forgotten explanation why explicit PEs are nonessential for multi-layer autoregressive Transformers (in contrast, one-layer models require PEs to discern order information of their inputs), as well as the origin of this result, and hope to re-establish it as a common knowledge.

Abstract: Scientific problems require resolving multi-scale phenomena across different resolutions and learning solution operators in infinite-dimensional function spaces. Neural operators provide a powerful framework for this, using tensor-parameterized layers to capture complex, multi-dimensional relationships. However, scaling neural operators to high-resolution problems leads to significant computational demands, making the training of industrial-scale models prohibitive. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TensorGRaD}, a novel method that directly addresses the memory challenges associated with optimizing large tensor-structured weights. Our approach, based on a \texit{robust tensor decomposition}, factorizes gradients as the sum of a low-rank tensor and a sparse one to efficiently capture information within optimizer states, including outliers. Additionally, we provide a recipe for mixed precision training of TensorGRaD, achieving further memory savings without sacrificing accuracy. We showcase the effectiveness of TensorGRaD on Fourier Neural Operators, a class of models crucial for solving partial differential equations (PDE). We provide theoretical guarantees for TensorGRaD, demonstrating its fundamental advantage over matrix-based gradient compression methods. We empirically demonstrate large improvements across various PDE tasks, including the challenging turbulent Navier-Stokes case at a Reynolds number of $10^5$. TensorGRaD reduces total memory usage by over $50\%$ while maintaining and sometimes even improving accuracy.

Abstract: Energy communities (ECs) play a key role in enabling local demand shifting and enhancing self-sufficiency, as energy systems transition toward decentralized structures with high shares of renewable generation. To optimally operate them, accurate short-term load forecasting is essential, particularly for implementing demand-side management strategies. With the recent rise of deep learning methods, data-driven forecasting has gained significant attention, however, it remains insufficiently explored in many practical contexts. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art deep learning models -- including LSTM, xLSTM, and Transformer architectures -- compared to traditional benchmarks such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and persistence forecasting, across varying community size, historical data availability, and model complexity. Additionally, we assess the benefits of transfer learning using publicly available synthetic load profiles. On average, transfer learning improves the normalized mean absolute error by 1.97%pt when only two months of training data are available. Interestingly, for less than six months of training data, simple persistence models outperform deep learning architectures in forecast accuracy. The practical value of improved forecasting is demonstrated using a mixed-integer linear programming optimization for ECs with a shared battery energy storage system. The most accurate deep learning model achieves an average reduction in financial energy costs of 8.06%. Notably, a simple KNN approach achieves average savings of 8.01%, making it a competitive and robust alternative. All implementations are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. These findings offer actionable insights for ECs, and they highlight when the additional complexity of deep learning is warranted by performance gains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, leading to widespread adoption in both research and industry. However, their inference workloads are computationally and energy intensive, raising concerns about sustainability and environmental impact. As LLMs continue to scale, it becomes essential to identify and optimize the factors that influence their runtime efficiency without compromising performance. In this work, we systematically investigate the energy-performance trade-offs of LLMs during inference. We benchmark models of varying sizes and architectures, including Falcon-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B, and GPT-Neo-2.7B, across tasks such as question answering, commonsense reasoning, and factual generation. We analyze the effect of input characteristics, such as sequence length, entropy, named entity density and so on. Furthermore, we examine the impact of hardware-level optimizations through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), measuring how different GPU clock settings affect latency and power consumption. Our empirical findings show that model architecture, input complexity, and clock configuration significantly influence inference efficiency. By correlating input features with energy metrics and evaluating DVFS behavior, we identify practical strategies that reduce energy consumption by up to 30% while preserving model quality. This study provides actionable insights for designing energy-efficient and sustainable LLM inference systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has transformed the seismic community with deep learning models (DLMs) that are trained to complete specific tasks within workflows. However, there is still lack of robust evaluation frameworks for evaluating and comparing DLMs. We address this gap by designing an evaluation framework that jointly incorporates two crucial aspects: performance uncertainty and learning efficiency. To target these aspects, we meticulously construct the training, validation, and test splits using a clustering method tailored to seismic data and enact an expansive training design to segregate performance uncertainty arising from stochastic training processes and random data sampling. The framework's ability to guard against misleading declarations of model superiority is demonstrated through evaluation of PhaseNet [1], a popular seismic phase picking DLM, under 3 training approaches. Our framework helps practitioners choose the best model for their problem and set performance expectations by explicitly analyzing model performance with uncertainty at varying budgets of training data.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the parameter counts of Large Language Models (LLMs), reaching billions or even trillions, presents significant challenges for their practical deployment, particularly in resource-constrained environments. To ease this issue, we propose PIP (Perturbation-based Iterative Pruning), a novel double-view structured pruning method to optimize LLMs, which combines information from two different views: the unperturbed view and the perturbed view. With the calculation of gradient differences, PIP iteratively prunes those that struggle to distinguish between these two views. Our experiments show that PIP reduces the parameter count by approximately 20% while retaining over 85% of the original model's accuracy across varied benchmarks. In some cases, the performance of the pruned model is within 5% of the unpruned version, demonstrating PIP's ability to preserve key aspects of model effectiveness. Moreover, PIP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) structured pruning methods, establishing it as a leading technique for optimizing LLMs in environments with constrained resources.

Abstract: While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer computationally efficient adaptations of Large Language Models (LLMs), their practical deployment often assumes centralized data and training environments. However, real-world scenarios frequently involve distributed, privacy-sensitive datasets that require decentralized solutions. Federated learning (FL) addresses data privacy by coordinating model updates across clients, but it is typically based on centralized aggregation through a parameter server, which can introduce bottlenecks and communication constraints. Decentralized learning, in contrast, eliminates this dependency by enabling direct collaboration between clients, improving scalability and efficiency in distributed environments. Despite its advantages, decentralized LLM fine-tuning remains underexplored. In this work, we propose Dec-LoRA, a decentralized fine-tuning algorithm for LLMs based on LoRA. Through extensive experiments on BERT and LLaMA-2 models, we demonstrate that Dec-LoRA achieves performance comparable to centralized LoRA under various conditions, including data heterogeneity and quantization constraints. Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical guarantee proving the convergence of our algorithm to a stationary point for non-convex and smooth loss functions. These findings highlight the potential of Dec-LoRA for scalable LLM fine-tuning in decentralized environments.

Abstract: Constructing efficient and diverse datasets is essential for the development of accurate machine learning potentials (MLPs) in atomistic simulations. However, existing approaches often suffer from data redundancy and high computational costs. Herein, we propose a new method--Difference Vectors based on Local Atomic Environments (DV-LAE)--that encodes structural differences via histogram-based descriptors and enables visual analysis through t-SNE dimensionality reduction. This approach facilitates redundancy detection and dataset optimization while preserving structural diversity. We demonstrate that DV-LAE significantly reduces dataset size and training time across various materials systems, including high-pressure hydrogen, iron-hydrogen binaries, magnesium hydrides, and carbon allotropes, with minimal compromise in prediction accuracy. For instance, in the $\alpha$-Fe/H system, maintaining a highly similar MLP accuracy, the dataset size was reduced by 56%, and the training time per iteration dropped by over 50%. Moreover, we show how visualizing the DV-LAE representation aids in identifying out-of-distribution data by examining the spatial distribution of high-error prediction points, providing a robust reliability metric for new structures during simulations. Our results highlight the utility of local environment visualization not only as an interpretability tool but also as a practical means for accelerating MLP development and ensuring data efficiency in large-scale atomistic modeling.

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for ensuring RL systems align with human values. However, it remains challenging to achieve in complex decision making domains. Existing methods frequently attempt interpretability at the level of fundamental model units, such as neurons or decision nodes: an approach which scales poorly to large models. Here, we instead propose an approach to interpretability at the level of functional modularity. We show how encouraging sparsity and locality in network weights leads to the emergence of functional modules in RL policy networks. To detect these modules, we develop an extended Louvain algorithm which uses a novel `correlation alignment' metric to overcome the limitations of standard network analysis techniques when applied to neural network architectures. Applying these methods to 2D and 3D MiniGrid environments reveals the consistent emergence of distinct navigational modules for different axes, and we further demonstrate how these functions can be validated through direct interventions on network weights prior to inference.

Abstract: Learn to Optimize (L2O) trains deep neural network based solvers for optimization, achieving success in accelerating convex problems and improving non-convex solutions. However, L2O lacks rigorous theoretical backing for its own training convergence, as existing analyses often use unrealistic assumptions -- a gap this work highlights empirically. We bridge this gap by proving the training convergence of L2O models that learn Gradient Descent (GD) hyperparameters for quadratic programming, leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. We propose a deterministic initialization strategy to support our theoretical results and promote stable training over extended optimization horizons by mitigating gradient explosion. Our L2O framework demonstrates over 50\% better optimality against GD and superior robustness over state-of-the-art L2O methods on synthetic datasets.

Abstract: In this position paper, we promote the study of function spaces parameterized by machine learning models through the lens of algebraic geometry. To this end, we focus on algebraic models, such as neural networks with polynomial activations, whose associated function spaces are semi-algebraic varieties. We outline a dictionary between algebro-geometric invariants of these varieties, such as dimension, degree, and singularities, and fundamental aspects of machine learning, such as sample complexity, expressivity, training dynamics, and implicit bias. Along the way, we review the literature and discuss ideas beyond the algebraic domain. This work lays the foundations of a research direction bridging algebraic geometry and deep learning, that we refer to as neuroalgebraic geometry.

Abstract: Tabular data is widely utilized in various machine learning tasks. Current tabular learning research predominantly focuses on closed environments, while in real-world applications, open environments are often encountered, where distribution and feature shifts occur, leading to significant degradation in model performance. Previous research has primarily concentrated on mitigating distribution shifts, whereas feature shifts, a distinctive and unexplored challenge of tabular data, have garnered limited attention. To this end, this paper conducts the first comprehensive study on feature shifts in tabular data and introduces the first tabular feature-shift benchmark (TabFSBench). TabFSBench evaluates impacts of four distinct feature-shift scenarios on four tabular model categories across various datasets and assesses the performance of large language models (LLMs) and tabular LLMs in the tabular benchmark for the first time. Our study demonstrates three main observations: (1) most tabular models have the limited applicability in feature-shift scenarios; (2) the shifted feature set importance has a linear relationship with model performance degradation; (3) model performance in closed environments correlates with feature-shift performance. Future research direction is also explored for each observation.

Abstract: Dynamic sparse training (DST) can reduce the computational demands in ANNs, but faces difficulties in keeping peak performance at high sparsity levels. The Cannistraci-Hebb training (CHT) is a brain-inspired method for growing connectivity in DST. CHT leverages a gradient-free, topology-driven link regrowth, which has shown ultra-sparse (less than 1% connectivity) advantage across various tasks compared to fully connected networks. Yet, CHT suffers two main drawbacks: (i) its time complexity is $O(Nd^3)$ - N node network size, d node degree - restricting it to ultra-sparse regimes. (ii) it selects top link prediction scores, which is inappropriate for the early training epochs, when the network presents unreliable connections. Here, we design the first brain-inspired network model - termed bipartite receptive field (BRF) - to initialize the connectivity of sparse artificial neural networks. We further introduce a GPU-friendly matrix-based approximation of CH link prediction, reducing complexity to $O(N^3)$. We introduce the Cannistraci-Hebb training soft rule (CHTs), which adopts a flexible strategy for sampling connections in both link removal and regrowth, balancing the exploration and exploitation of network topology. Additionally, we integrate CHTs with a sigmoid gradual density decay (CHTss). Empirical results show that BRF offers performance advantages over previous network science models. Using 1% of connections, CHTs outperforms fully connected networks in MLP architectures on image classification tasks, compressing some networks to less than 30% of the nodes. Using 5% of the connections, CHTss outperforms fully connected networks in two Transformer-based machine translation tasks. Finally, at 30% connectivity, both CHTs and CHTss outperform other DST methods in language modeling and even exceed fully connected baselines in zero-shot tasks.

Abstract: This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating realistic new samples. Over the years, advanced architectures and sampling methods have been developed to make these models practically usable. However, certain synthesis process decisions still rely on heuristics without a solid theoretical foundation. In our work, we offer a novel analysis of the DM's inference process, introducing a comprehensive frequency response perspective. Specifically, by relying on Gaussianity assumption, we present the inference process as a closed-form spectral transfer function, capturing how the generated signal evolves in response to the initial noise. We demonstrate how the proposed analysis can be leveraged to design a noise schedule that aligns effectively with the characteristics of the data. The spectral perspective also provides insights into the underlying dynamics and sheds light on the relationship between spectral properties and noise schedule structure. Our results lead to scheduling curves that are dependent on the spectral content of the data, offering a theoretical justification for some of the heuristics taken by practitioners.

Abstract: Structural causal models (SCMs) allow us to investigate complex systems at multiple levels of resolution. The causal abstraction (CA) framework formalizes the mapping between high- and low-level SCMs. We address CA learning in a challenging and realistic setting, where SCMs are inaccessible, interventional data is unavailable, and sample data is misaligned. A key principle of our framework is semantic embedding, formalized as the high-level distribution lying on a subspace of the low-level one. This principle naturally links linear CA to the geometry of the Stiefel manifold. We present a category-theoretic approach to SCMs that enables the learning of a CA by finding a morphism between the low- and high-level probability measures, adhering to the semantic embedding principle. Consequently, we formulate a general CA learning problem. As an application, we solve the latter problem for linear CA; considering Gaussian measures and the Kullback-Leibler divergence as an objective. Given the nonconvexity of the learning task, we develop three algorithms building upon existing paradigms for Riemannian optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed methods succeed on both synthetic and real-world brain data with different degrees of prior information about the structure of CA.

Specifically, our main objective is to recover a matrix $ X_\star \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times n_2} $ with rank $ r_\star $ from noisy measurements using an over-parameterized factorization $ LR^\top $, where $ L \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times r}, \, R \in \mathbb{R}^{n_2 \times r} $ and $ \min\{n_1, n_2\} \ge r > r_\star $, with $ r_\star $ being unknown. Recently, preconditioning methods have been proposed to accelerate the convergence of matrix sensing problem compared to vanilla gradient descent, incorporating preconditioning terms $ (L^\top L + \lambda I)^{-1} $ and $ (R^\top R + \lambda I)^{-1} $ into the original gradient. However, these methods require careful tuning of the damping parameter $\lambda$ and are sensitive to step size. To address these limitations, we propose the alternating preconditioned gradient descent (APGD) algorithm, which alternately updates the two factor matrices, eliminating the need for the damping parameter $\lambda$ and enabling faster convergence with larger step sizes. We theoretically prove that APGD convergences to a near-optimal error at a linear rate. We further show that APGD can be extended to deal with other low-rank matrix estimation tasks, also with a theoretical guarantee of linear convergence. To validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed APGD, we conduct simulated and real-world experiments on a wide range of low-rank estimation problems, including noisy matrix sensing, weighted PCA, 1-bit matrix completion, and matrix completion. The extensive results demonstrate that APGD consistently achieves the fastest convergence and the lowest computation time compared to the existing alternatives.

<title>LLM Safety Alignment is Divergence Estimation in Disguise</title>

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework showing that popular LLM alignment methods, including RLHF and its variants, can be understood as divergence estimators between aligned (safe or preferred) and unaligned (harmful or less preferred) distributions. This perspective explains the emergence of separation in the latent space between safe and harmful prompts after alignment. As an application of our general divergence framework, we propose KLDO, a novel KL divergence-based alignment method, and empirically validate its effectiveness. We further show that using compliance-refusal datasets, rather than standard preference-based datasets, leads to stronger separation and improved safety alignment. Finally, to quantify the separation effect, we propose a distance-based metric in the prompt representation space, which also acts as a statistically significant indicator for model safety.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in their reasoning capabilities, hold transformative potential for addressing complex challenges in atmospheric science. However, leveraging LLMs effectively in this domain requires a robust and comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Toward this end, we present AtmosSci-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess LLM performance across five core categories of atmospheric science problems: hydrology, atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and physical oceanography. AtmosSci-Bench features a dual-format design comprising both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and open-ended questions (OEQs), enabling scalable automated evaluation alongside deeper analysis of conceptual understanding. We employ a template-based MCQ generation framework to create diverse, graduate-level problems with symbolic perturbation, while OEQs are used to probe open-ended reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative LLMs, categorized into four groups: instruction-tuned models, advanced reasoning models, math-augmented models, and domain-specific climate models. Our analysis provides some interesting insights into the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in atmospheric science. We believe AtmosSci-Bench can serve as a critical step toward advancing LLM applications in climate service by offering a standard and rigorous evaluation framework.

Abstract: We present an approach to model-based RL that achieves a new state of the art performance on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, an open-world 2D survival game that requires agents to exhibit a wide range of general abilities -- such as strong generalization, deep exploration, and long-term reasoning. With a series of careful design choices aimed at improving sample efficiency, our MBRL algorithm achieves a reward of 69.66% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and, for the first time, exceeds human performance of 65.0%. Our method starts by constructing a SOTA model-free baseline, using a novel policy architecture that combines CNNs and RNNs. We then add three improvements to the standard MBRL setup: (a) "Dyna with warmup", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, (b) "nearest neighbor tokenizer" on image patches, which improves the scheme to create the transformer world model (TWM) inputs, and (c) "block teacher forcing", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep.

Abstract: Inspired by human SYSTEM 2 thinking, LLMs excel at complex reasoning tasks via extended Chain-of-Thought. However, similar test-time scaling for diffusion models to tackle complex reasoning remains largely unexplored. From existing work, two primary challenges emerge in this setting: (i) the dependence on an external verifier indicating a notable gap from intrinsic reasoning of human intelligence without any external feedback, and (ii) the lack of an efficient search algorithm. In this paper, we introduce the Verifier-free Test-time Scalable Diffusion Model (VFScale) to achieve scalable intrinsic reasoning, which equips number-of-sample test-time scaling with the intrinsic energy function of diffusion models as the verifier. Concretely, VFScale comprises two key innovations to address the aforementioned challenges. On the training side, VFScale consists of a novel LRNCL loss and a KL regularization to improve the energy landscape, ensuring that the learned energy function itself serves as a reliable verifier. On the inference side, VFScale integrates the denoising process with a novel hybrid Monte Carlo Tree Search (hMCTS) to improve search efficiency. On challenging reasoning tasks of Maze and Sudoku, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VFScale's training objective and scalable inference method. In particular, trained with Maze sizes of up to $6\times6$, our VFScale solves 88% of Maze problems with much larger sizes of $15\times15$, while standard diffusion model completely fails.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of drug responses remains a formidable challenge, particularly at the single-cell level and in clinical treatment contexts. Some studies employ transfer learning techniques to predict drug responses in individual cells and patients, but they require access to target-domain data during training, which is often unavailable or only obtainable in future. In this study, we propose a novel domain generalization framework, termed FourierDrug, to address this challenge. Given the extracted feature from expression profile, we performed Fourier transforms and then introduced an asymmetric attention constraint that would cluster drug-sensitive samples into a compact group while drives resistant samples dispersed in the frequency domain. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that our model effectively learns task-relevant features from diverse source domains, and achieves accurate predictions of drug response for unseen cancer type. When evaluated on single-cell and patient-level drug response prediction tasks, FourierDrug--trained solely on in vitro cell line data without access to target-domain data--consistently outperforms or, at least, matched the performance of current state-of-the-art methods. These findings underscore the potential of our method for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is generally more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 21.25\% compared with KIVI-KV8 quantization over various context lengths. Our code and searched configurations are available at https://github.com/cmd2001/KVTuner.

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of coexistence for embodied artificial agents and argues that it is a prerequisite for long-term, in-the-wild interaction with humans. Contemporary embodied artificial agents excel in static, predefined tasks but fall short in dynamic and long-term interactions with humans. On the other hand, humans can adapt and evolve continuously, exploiting the situated knowledge embedded in their environment and other agents, thus contributing to meaningful interactions. We take an interdisciplinary approach at different levels of organization, drawing from biology and design theory, to understand how human and non-human organisms foster entities that coexist within their specific environments. Finally, we propose key research directions for the artificial intelligence community to develop coexisting embodied agents, focusing on the principles, hardware and learning methods responsible for shaping them.

<title>Towards a Sharp Analysis of Offline Policy Learning for $f$-Divergence-Regularized Contextual Bandits</title>

Abstract: Although many popular reinforcement learning algorithms are underpinned by $f$-divergence regularization, their sample complexity with respect to the \emph{regularized objective} still lacks a tight characterization. In this paper, we analyze $f$-divergence-regularized offline policy learning. For reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, arguably the most commonly used one, we give the first $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity under single-policy concentrability for contextual bandits, surpassing existing $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ bound under all-policy concentrability and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ bound under single-policy concentrability. Our analysis for general function approximation leverages the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty to refine a mean-value-type argument to its extreme. This in turn leads to a novel moment-based technique, effectively bypassing the need for uniform control over the discrepancy between any two functions in the function class. We further propose a lower bound, demonstrating that a multiplicative dependency on single-policy concentrability is necessary to maximally exploit the strong convexity of reverse KL. In addition, for $f$-divergences with strongly convex $f$, to which reverse KL \emph{does not} belong, we show that the sharp sample complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(\epsilon^{-1})$ is achievable even without single-policy concentrability. In this case, the algorithm design can get rid of pessimistic estimators. We further extend our analysis to dueling bandits, and we believe these results take a significant step toward a comprehensive understanding of $f$-divergence-regularized policy learning.

Abstract: As implied by the plethora of literature on graph rewiring, the choice of computational graph employed by a neural network can make a significant impact on its downstream performance. Certain effects related to the computational graph, such as under-reaching and over-squashing, may even render the model incapable of learning certain functions. Most of these effects have only been thoroughly studied in the domain of undirected graphs; however, recent years have seen a significant rise in interest in feedforward computational graphs: directed graphs without any back edges. In this paper, we study the desirable properties of a feedforward computational graph, discovering two important complementary measures: fidelity and mixing time, and evaluating a few popular choices of graphs through the lens of these measures. Our study is backed by both theoretical analyses of the metrics' asymptotic behaviour for various graphs, as well as correlating these metrics to the performance of trained neural network models using the corresponding graphs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown that KL-regularization plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of RL fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.

Abstract: We consider the privacy amplification properties of a sampling scheme in which a user's data is used in $k$ steps chosen randomly and uniformly from a sequence (or set) of $t$ steps. This sampling scheme has been recently applied in the context of differentially private optimization [Chua et al., 2024a, Choquette-Choo et al., 2024] and is also motivated by communication-efficient high-dimensional private aggregation [Asi et al., 2025]. Existing analyses of this scheme either rely on privacy amplification by shuffling which leads to overly conservative bounds or require Monte Carlo simulations that are computationally prohibitive in most practical scenarios.
  We give the first theoretical guarantees and numerical estimation algorithms for this sampling scheme. In particular, we demonstrate that the privacy guarantees of random $k$-out-of-$t$ allocation can be upper bounded by the privacy guarantees of the well-studied independent (or Poisson) subsampling in which each step uses the user's data with probability $(1+o(1))k/t$. Further, we provide two additional analysis techniques that lead to numerical improvements in several parameter regimes. Altogether, our bounds give efficiently-computable and nearly tight numerical results for random allocation applied to Gaussian noise addition.

Abstract: The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that schedules where the TV explodes exponentially can often be improved by adopting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the generation performance. Our findings hold across various reverse diffusion solvers and diverse applications, including molecular structure and image generation.

Abstract: While many advances in time series models focus exclusively on numerical data, research on multimodal time series, particularly those involving contextual textual information commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, remains in its infancy. With recent progress in large language models and time series learning, we revisit the integration of paired texts with time series through the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that representations of different modalities converge to shared spaces. In this context, we identify that time-series-paired texts may naturally exhibit periodic properties that closely mirror those of the original time series. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, Texts as Time Series (TaTS), which considers the time-series-paired texts to be auxiliary variables of the time series. TaTS can be plugged into any existing numerical-only time series models and enable them to handle time series data with paired texts effectively. Through extensive experiments on both multimodal time series forecasting and imputation tasks across benchmark datasets with various existing time series models, we demonstrate that TaTS can enhance predictive performance without modifying model architectures.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority of the nodes in a graph, which has been attracting significant attention in recent years. Existing generalist graph models have achieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize to the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning generalized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and heterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address this challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model that supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse graph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for normal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD across different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align data-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node representation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its neighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into a unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of nodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force for the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal and abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs, including very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes available in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to leverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero- and few-shot GAD settings.

Abstract: Graph transformers extend global self-attention to graph-structured data, achieving notable success in graph learning. Recently, random walk structural encoding (RWSE) has been found to further enhance their predictive power by encoding both structural and positional information into the edge representation. However, RWSE cannot always distinguish between edges that belong to different local graph patterns, which reduces its ability to capture the full structural complexity of graphs. This work introduces Simple Path Structural Encoding (SPSE), a novel method that utilizes simple path counts for edge encoding. We show theoretically and experimentally that SPSE overcomes the limitations of RWSE, providing a richer representation of graph structures, particularly for capturing local cyclic patterns. To make SPSE computationally tractable, we propose an efficient approximate algorithm for simple path counting. SPSE demonstrates significant performance improvements over RWSE on various benchmarks, including molecular and long-range graph datasets, achieving statistically significant gains in discriminative tasks. These results pose SPSE as a powerful edge encoding alternative for enhancing the expressivity of graph transformers.

Abstract: User information needs are often highly diverse and varied. A key challenge in current research is how to achieve controllable multi-objective generation while enabling rapid adaptation to accommodate diverse user demands during test time. Existing solutions, such as Rewarded Soup, focus on merging language models individually tuned on single objectives. While easy to implement and widely used, these approaches face limitations in achieving optimal performance due to their disregard for the impacts of competing objectives on model tuning. To address this issue, we propose Bone Soup, a novel model merging approach that first seeks a series of backbone models by considering the impacts of multiple objectives and then makes the soup (i.e., merge the backbone models). Specifically, Bone Soup begins by training multiple backbone models for different objectives using multi-objective reinforcement learning. Each backbone model is guided by a combination of backbone reward signals. To ensure that these models are optimal for the Pareto front, the backbone rewards are crafted by combining standard reward functions into basis vectors, which can then be modified through a rule-based construction method. Bone Soup leverages a symmetric circulant matrix mapping to generate the merging coefficients, which are used to merge the backbone models according to user preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Bone Soup exhibits strong controllability and Pareto optimality in controllable multi-objective generation, providing a more effective and efficient approach to addressing diverse user needs at test time.

Abstract: Despite exceptional capabilities in knowledge-intensive tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical gap in understanding how they internalize new knowledge, particularly how to structurally embed acquired knowledge in their neural computations. We address this issue through the lens of knowledge circuit evolution, identifying computational subgraphs that facilitate knowledge storage and processing. Our systematic analysis of circuit evolution throughout continual pre-training reveals several key findings: (1) the acquisition of new knowledge is influenced by its relevance to pre-existing knowledge; (2) the evolution of knowledge circuits exhibits a distinct phase shift from formation to optimization; (3) the evolution of knowledge circuits follows a deep-to-shallow pattern. These insights not only advance our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of new knowledge acquisition in LLMs, but also provide potential implications for improving continual pre-training strategies to enhance model performance. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/DynamicKnowledgeCircuits.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has been a powerful paradigm for improving model efficiency and performance by selecting the most informative data points for labeling and training. In recent active learning frameworks, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed not only for selection but also for generating entirely new data instances and providing more cost-effective annotations. Motivated by the increasing importance of high-quality data and efficient model training in the era of LLMs, we present a comprehensive survey on LLM-based Active Learning. We introduce an intuitive taxonomy that categorizes these techniques and discuss the transformative roles LLMs can play in the active learning loop. We further examine the impact of AL on LLM learning paradigms and its applications across various domains. Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research directions. This survey aims to serve as an up-to-date resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to gain an intuitive understanding of LLM-based AL techniques and deploy them to new applications.

Existing efficient evaluation methods estimate the performance of target models by testing them only on a small and static coreset of the benchmark, which is derived from the publicly available evaluation results of source models. These methods rely on the assumption that target models have high prediction consistency with source models. However, we demonstrate that it doesn't generalize well in practice. To alleviate the inconsistency issue, we present TailoredBench, a method that conducts customized evaluation tailored to each target model. Specifically, a Global-coreset is first constructed as a probe to identify the most consistent source models for each target model with an adaptive source model selection strategy. Afterwards, a scalable K-Medoids clustering algorithm is proposed to extend the Global-coreset to a tailored Native-coreset for each target model. According to the predictions on Native-coresets, we obtain the performance of target models on the whole benchmark with a calibrated estimation strategy. Comprehensive experiments on 5 benchmarks across over 300 models demonstrate that compared to best performing baselines, TailoredBench achieves an average reduction of 31.4% in MAE of accuracy estimates under the same inference budgets, showcasing strong effectiveness and generalizability.

<title>Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning</title>

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) provides a cost-effective solution by approximating weight updates through low-rank matrices. In real-world scenarios, LLMs are fine-tuned on data from multiple domains to perform tasks across various fields, embodying multi-task learning (MTL). LoRA often underperforms in such complex scenarios. To enhance LoRA's capability in multi-task learning, we propose R-LoRA, which incorporates Multi-Head Randomization. Multi-Head Randomization diversifies the head matrices through Multi-Head Dropout and Multi-Head Random Initialization, enabling more efficient learning of task-specific features while maintaining shared knowledge representation. Our approach not only improves performance in MTL but also reduces GPU memory usage and training time. Experiments show that R-LoRA's gains stem from increased diversity in the head matrices, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-task learning.

Abstract: Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to reduce overconfidence in neural network predictions and improve generalization. Despite these benefits, recent studies reveal two critical issues with LS. First, LS induces overconfidence in misclassified samples. Second, it compacts feature representations into overly tight clusters, diluting intra-class diversity, although the precise cause of this phenomenon remained elusive. In this paper, we analytically decompose the LS-induced loss, exposing two key terms: (i) a regularization term that dampens overconfidence only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-amplification term that arises under misclassifications. This latter term compels the network to reinforce incorrect predictions with undue certainty, exacerbating representation collapse. To address these shortcomings, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which applies uniform regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit rather than the ground-truth logit. Through extensive feature-space analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Experiments on large-scale image classification and multiple downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS, consistently reducing overconfidence while preserving richer feature representations.

Abstract: Large-scale physical systems defined on irregular grids pose significant scalability challenges for deep learning methods, especially in the presence of long-range interactions and multi-scale coupling. Traditional approaches that compute all pairwise interactions, such as attention, become computationally prohibitive as they scale quadratically with the number of nodes. We present Erwin, a hierarchical transformer inspired by methods from computational many-body physics, which combines the efficiency of tree-based algorithms with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Erwin employs ball tree partitioning to organize computation, which enables linear-time attention by processing nodes in parallel within local neighborhoods of fixed size. Through progressive coarsening and refinement of the ball tree structure, complemented by a novel cross-ball interaction mechanism, it captures both fine-grained local details and global features. We demonstrate Erwin's effectiveness across multiple domains, including cosmology, molecular dynamics, PDE solving, and particle fluid dynamics, where it consistently outperforms baseline methods both in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.

<title>Tokens for Learning, Tokens for Unlearning: Mitigating Membership Inference Attacks in Large Language Models via Dual-Purpose Training</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the backbone of modern natural language processing but pose privacy concerns about leaking sensitive training data. Membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a sample is included in a model's training dataset, can serve as a foundation for broader privacy threats. Existing defenses designed for traditional classification models do not account for the sequential nature of text data. As a result, they either require significant computational resources or fail to effectively mitigate privacy risks in LLMs. In this work, we propose \methodname, a lightweight yet effective empirical privacy defense for protecting training data of language models by leveraging token-specific characteristics. By analyzing token dynamics during training, we propose a token selection strategy that categorizes tokens into hard tokens for learning and memorized tokens for unlearning. Subsequently, our training-phase defense optimizes a novel dual-purpose token-level loss to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between utility and privacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only provides strong protection against MIAs but also improves language modeling performance by around 10\% across various LLM architectures and datasets compared to the baselines.

Abstract: Text-rich Graph Knowledge Bases (TG-KBs) have become increasingly crucial for answering queries by providing textual and structural knowledge. However, current retrieval methods often retrieve these two types of knowledge in isolation without considering their mutual reinforcement and some hybrid methods even bypass structural retrieval entirely after neighboring aggregation. To fill in this gap, we propose a Mixture of Structural-and-Textual Retrieval (MoR) to retrieve these two types of knowledge via a Planning-Reasoning-Organizing framework. In the Planning stage, MoR generates textual planning graphs delineating the logic for answering queries. Following planning graphs, in the Reasoning stage, MoR interweaves structural traversal and textual matching to obtain candidates from TG-KBs. In the Organizing stage, MoR further reranks fetched candidates based on their structural trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MoR in harmonizing structural and textual retrieval with insights, including uneven retrieving performance across different query logics and the benefits of integrating structural trajectories for candidate reranking. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yoega/MoR.

<title>Quantifying First-Order Markov Violations in Noisy Reinforcement Learning: A Causal Discovery Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00206</link>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) methods frequently assume that each new observation completely reflects the environment's state, thereby guaranteeing Markovian (one-step) transitions. In practice, partial observability or sensor/actuator noise often invalidates this assumption. This paper proposes a systematic methodology for detecting such violations, combining a partial correlation-based causal discovery process (PCMCI) with a novel Markov Violation score (MVS). The MVS measures multi-step dependencies that emerge when noise or incomplete state information disrupts the Markov property.
  Classic control tasks (CartPole, Pendulum, Acrobot) serve as examples to illustrate how targeted noise and dimension omissions affect both RL performance and measured Markov consistency. Surprisingly, even substantial observation noise sometimes fails to induce strong multi-lag dependencies in certain domains (e.g., Acrobot). In contrast, dimension-dropping investigations show that excluding some state variables (e.g., angular velocities in CartPole and Pendulum) significantly reduces returns and increases MVS, while removing other dimensions has minimal impact.
  These findings emphasize the importance of locating and safeguarding the most causally essential dimensions in order to preserve effective single-step learning. By integrating partial correlation tests with RL performance outcomes, the proposed approach precisely identifies when and where the Markov assumption is violated. This framework offers a principled mechanism for developing robust policies, informing representation learning, and addressing partial observability in real-world RL scenarios. All code and experimental logs are accessible for reproducibility (https://github.com/ucsb/markovianess).

Abstract: We present the POPGym Arcade, a collection of hardware-accelerated, pixel-based environments with shared observation and action spaces. Each environment includes fully and partially observable variants, enabling counterfactual studies on partial observability. We also introduce mathematical tools for analyzing policies under partial observability, which reveal how agents recall past information to make decisions. Our analysis shows (1) that controlling for partial observability is critical and (2) that agents with long-term memory learn brittle policies that struggle to generalize. Finally, we demonstrate that recurrent policies can be "poisoned" by old, out-of-distribution observations, with implications for sim-to-real transfer, imitation learning, and offline reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models(LRMs) such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities by scaling test-time compute and generating long Chain-of-Thought(CoT). Distillation--post-training on LRMs-generated data--is a straightforward yet effective method to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models, but faces a critical bottleneck: we found that distilled long CoT data poses learning difficulty for small models and leads to the inheritance of biases (i.e. over-thinking) when using Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose constructing tree-based CoT data from scratch via Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS). We then exploit a set of CoT-aware approaches, including Thoughts Length Balance, Fine-grained DPO, and Joint Post-training Objective, to enhance SFT and RL on the constructed data. We conduct evaluation on various benchmarks such as math (GSM8K, MATH, AIME). instruction-following (Multi-IF) and planning (Blocksworld), results demonstrate our approaches substantially improve the reasoning performance of distilled models compared to standard distilled models via reducing the hallucinations in long-time thinking.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise across many tasks, yet their scientific reasoning capabilities remain untested, particularly in multimodal settings. We present MMSciBench, a benchmark for evaluating mathematical and physical reasoning through text-only and text-image formats, with human-annotated difficulty levels, solutions with detailed explanations, and taxonomic mappings. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant limitations, with even the best model achieving only \textbf{63.77\%} accuracy and particularly struggling with visual reasoning tasks. Our analysis exposes critical gaps in complex reasoning and visual-textual integration, establishing MMSciBench as a rigorous standard for measuring progress in multimodal scientific understanding. The code for MMSciBench is open-sourced at GitHub, and the dataset is available at Hugging Face.

Abstract: We study how inherent randomness in the training process -- where each sample (or client in federated learning) contributes only to a randomly selected portion of training -- can be leveraged for privacy amplification. This includes (1) data partitioning, where a sample participates in only a subset of training iterations, and (2) model partitioning, where a sample updates only a subset of the model parameters. We apply our framework to model parallelism in federated learning, where each client updates a randomly selected subnetwork to reduce memory and computational overhead, and show that existing methods, e.g. model splitting or dropout, provide a significant privacy amplification gain not captured by previous privacy analysis techniques. Additionally, we introduce Balanced Iteration Subsampling, a new data partitioning method where each sample (or client) participates in a fixed number of training iterations. We show that this method yields stronger privacy amplification than Poisson (i.i.d.) sampling of data (or clients). Our results demonstrate that randomness in the training process, which is structured rather than i.i.d. and interacts with data in complex ways, can be systematically leveraged for significant privacy amplification.

Abstract: Concept-based models are an emerging paradigm in deep learning that constrains the inference process to operate through human-interpretable variables, facilitating explainability and human interaction. However, these architectures, on par with popular opaque neural models, fail to account for the true causal mechanisms underlying the target phenomena represented in the data. This hampers their ability to support causal reasoning tasks, limits out-of-distribution generalization, and hinders the implementation of fairness constraints. To overcome these issues, we propose Causally reliable Concept Bottleneck Models (C$^2$BMs), a class of concept-based architectures that enforce reasoning through a bottleneck of concepts structured according to a model of the real-world causal mechanisms. We also introduce a pipeline to automatically learn this structure from observational data and unstructured background knowledge (e.g., scientific literature). Experimental evidence suggests that C$^2$BMs are more interpretable, causally reliable, and improve responsiveness to interventions w.r.t. standard opaque and concept-based models, while maintaining their accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal accuracy impact. However, existing methods often suffer from accuracy degradation without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Moreover, despite updating weights with regional optimization, Wanda++ remains orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, further reducing perplexity with LoRA in great extend. Our approach is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single H100 GPU.

Abstract: Code embeddings are essential for semantic code search; however, current approaches often struggle to capture the precise syntactic and contextual nuances inherent in code. Open-source models such as CodeBERT and UniXcoder exhibit limitations in scalability and efficiency, while high-performing proprietary systems impose substantial computational costs. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to construct task-specific adapters for code retrieval. Our approach reduces the number of trainable parameters to less than two percent of the base model, enabling rapid fine-tuning on extensive code corpora (2 million samples in 25 minutes on two H100 GPUs). Experiments demonstrate an increase of up to 9.1% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for Code2Code search, and up to 86.69% for Text2Code search tasks across multiple programming languages. Distinction in task-wise and language-wise adaptation helps explore the sensitivity of code retrieval for syntactical and linguistic variations. To foster research in this area, we make our code and pre-trained models publicly available.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising approach for NP-hard problems. However, prevailing RL-based methods suffer from low sample efficiency due to sparse rewards and underused solutions. We propose Best-anchored and Objective-guided Preference Optimization (BOPO), a training paradigm that leverages solution preferences via objective values. It introduces: (1) a best-anchored preference pair construction for better explore and exploit solutions, and (2) an objective-guided pairwise loss function that adaptively scales gradients via objective differences, removing reliance on reward models or reference policies. Experiments on Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP), Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) show BOPO outperforms state-of-the-art neural methods, reducing optimality gaps impressively with efficient inference. BOPO is architecture-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with existing NCO models, and establishes preference optimization as a principled framework for combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular technique for interpreting language model activations, and there is extensive recent work on improving SAE effectiveness. However, most prior work evaluates progress using unsupervised proxy metrics with unclear practical relevance. We introduce SAEBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures SAE performance across eight diverse metrics, spanning interpretability, feature disentanglement and practical applications like unlearning. To enable systematic comparison, we open-source a suite of over 200 SAEs across eight recently proposed SAE architectures and training algorithms. Our evaluation reveals that gains on proxy metrics do not reliably translate to better practical performance. For instance, while Matryoshka SAEs slightly underperform on existing proxy metrics, they substantially outperform other architectures on feature disentanglement metrics; moreover, this advantage grows with SAE scale. By providing a standardized framework for measuring progress in SAE development, SAEBench enables researchers to study scaling trends and make nuanced comparisons between different SAE architectures and training methodologies. Our interactive interface enables researchers to flexibly visualize relationships between metrics across hundreds of open-source SAEs at: www.neuronpedia.org/sae-bench

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has made remarkable progress, yet existing systems still lack intuitive control over spatial composition, object consistency, and multi-step editing. We present $\textbf{LayerCraft}$, a modular framework that uses large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents to orchestrate structured, layered image generation and editing. LayerCraft supports two key capabilities: (1) $\textit{structured generation}$ from simple prompts via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling it to decompose scenes, reason about object placement, and guide composition in a controllable, interpretable manner; and (2) $\textit{layered object integration}$, allowing users to insert and customize objects -- such as characters or props -- across diverse images or scenes while preserving identity, context, and style. The system comprises a coordinator agent, the $\textbf{ChainArchitect}$ for CoT-driven layout planning, and the $\textbf{Object Integration Network (OIN)}$ for seamless image editing using off-the-shelf T2I models without retraining. Through applications like batch collage editing and narrative scene generation, LayerCraft empowers non-experts to iteratively design, customize, and refine visual content with minimal manual effort. Code will be released at https://github.com/PeterYYZhang/LayerCraft.

Abstract: Multi-label Recognition (MLR) involves assigning multiple labels to each data instance in an image, offering advantages over single-label classification in complex scenarios. However, it faces the challenge of annotating all relevant categories, often leading to uncertain annotations, such as unseen or incomplete labels. Recent Vision and Language Pre-training (VLP) based methods have made significant progress in tackling zero-shot MLR tasks by leveraging rich vision-language correlations. However, the correlation between multi-label semantics has not been fully explored, and the learned visual features often lack essential semantic information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Semantic-guided Representation Learning approach (SigRL) that enables the model to learn effective visual and textual representations, thereby improving the downstream alignment of visual images and categories. Specifically, we first introduce a graph-based multi-label correlation module (GMC) to facilitate information exchange between labels, enriching the semantic representation across the multi-label texts. Next, we propose a Semantic Visual Feature Reconstruction module (SVFR) to enhance the semantic information in the visual representation by integrating the learned textual representation during reconstruction. Finally, we optimize the image-text matching capability of the VLP model using both local and global features to achieve zero-shot MLR. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several MLR benchmarks, encompassing both zero-shot MLR (with unseen labels) and single positive multi-label learning (with limited labels), demonstrating the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/MVL-Lab/SigRL.

Abstract: Given two boundary distributions, the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem seeks the ``most likely`` random evolution between them with respect to a reference process. It has revealed rich connections to recent machine learning methods for generative modeling and distribution matching. While these methods perform well in Euclidean domains, they are not directly applicable to topological domains such as graphs and simplicial complexes, which are crucial for data defined over network entities, such as node signals and edge flows. In this work, we propose the Topological Schr\"odinger Bridge problem (TSBP) for matching signal distributions on a topological domain. We set the reference process to follow some linear tractable topology-aware stochastic dynamics such as topological heat diffusion. For the case of Gaussian boundary distributions, we derive a closed-form topological SB (TSB) in terms of its time-marginal and stochastic differential. In the general case, leveraging the well-known result, we show that the optimal process follows the forward-backward topological dynamics governed by some unknowns. Building on these results, we develop TSB-based models for matching topological signals by parameterizing the unknowns in the optimal process as (topological) neural networks and learning them through likelihood training. We validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical applications of TSB-based models on both synthetic and real-world networks, emphasizing the role of topology. Additionally, we discuss the connections of TSB-based models to other emerging models, and outline future directions for topological signal matching.

Abstract: Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold2. Despite these developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions. Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. We released our code at https://github.com/bytedance/apm.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH), suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However, current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and optimizers.

Abstract: Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language $K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute hallucinations.
  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only correct examples from the target language.
  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples (explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.
  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: This paper proposes a parameter collaborative optimization algorithm for large language models, enhanced with graph spectral analysis. The goal is to improve both fine-tuning efficiency and structural awareness during training. In the proposed method, the parameters of a pre-trained language model are treated as nodes in a graph. A weighted graph is constructed, and Laplacian spectral decomposition is applied to enable frequency-domain modeling and structural representation of the parameter space. Based on this structure, a joint loss function is designed. It combines the task loss with a spectral regularization term to facilitate collaborative updates among parameters. In addition, a spectral filtering mechanism is introduced during the optimization phase. This mechanism adjusts gradients in a structure-aware manner, enhancing the model's training stability and convergence behavior. The method is evaluated on multiple tasks, including traditional fine-tuning comparisons, few-shot generalization tests, and convergence speed analysis. In all settings, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance. The experimental results confirm that the spectral collaborative optimization framework effectively reduces parameter perturbations and improves fine-tuning quality while preserving overall model performance. This work contributes significantly to the field of artificial intelligence by advancing parameter-efficient training methodologies for large-scale models, reinforcing the importance of structural signal processing in deep learning optimization, and offering a robust, generalizable framework for enhancing language model adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that deep neural networks degrade in generalization performance under noisy supervision. Existing methods focus on isolating clean subsets or correcting noisy labels, facing limitations such as high computational costs, heavy hyperparameter tuning process, and coarse-grained optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage noisy learning framework that enables instance-level optimization through a dynamically weighted loss function, avoiding hyperparameter tuning. To obtain stable and accurate information about noise modeling, we introduce a simple yet effective metric, termed wrong event, which dynamically models the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples while maintaining computational costs. Our framework first collects wrong event information and builds a strong base model. Then we perform noise-robust training on the base model, using a probabilistic model to handle the wrong event information of samples. Experiments on five synthetic and real-world LNL benchmarks demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance, achieves a nearly 75% reduction in computational time and improves model scalability.

Abstract: Medical audio signals, such as heart and lung sounds, play a crucial role in clinical diagnosis. However, analyzing these signals remains challenging: traditional methods rely on handcrafted features or supervised deep learning models that demand extensive labeled datasets, limiting their scalability and applicability. To address these issues, we propose CaReAQA, an audio-language model that integrates a foundation audio model with the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling clinically relevant, open-ended diagnostic responses. Alongside CaReAQA, we introduce CaReSound, a benchmark dataset of annotated medical audio recordings enriched with metadata and paired question-answer examples, intended to drive progress in diagnostic reasoning research. Evaluation results show that CaReAQA achieves 86.2% accuracy on open-ended diagnostic reasoning tasks, outperforming baseline models. It also generalizes well to closed-ended classification tasks, achieving an average accuracy of 56.9% on unseen datasets. Our findings show how audio-language integration and reasoning advances medical diagnostics, enabling efficient AI systems for clinical decision support.

Abstract: With over 700 stars on GitHub and being part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer is the default tool for applying graph-based optimizations to ONNX models. Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.

Abstract: Traditional domain generalization approaches predominantly focus on leveraging target domain-aware features while overlooking the critical role of source domain-specific characteristics, particularly in federated settings with inherent data isolation. To address this gap, we propose the Federated Source Domain Awareness Framework (FedSDAF), the first method to systematically exploit source domain-aware features for enhanced federated domain generalization (FedDG). The FedSDAF framework consists of two synergistic components: the Domain-Invariant Adapter, which preserves critical domain-invariant features, and the Domain-Aware Adapter, which extracts and integrates source domain-specific knowledge using a Multihead Self-Attention mechanism (MHSA). Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional knowledge distillation mechanism that fosters knowledge sharing among clients while safeguarding privacy. Our approach represents the first systematic exploitation of source domain-aware features, resulting in significant advancements in model generalization capability.Extensive experiments on four standard benchmarks (OfficeHome, PACS, VLCS, and DomainNet) show that our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art federated domain generalization approaches, with accuracy gains of 5.2-13.8%. The source code is available at https://github.com/pizzareapers/FedSDAF.

Abstract: Responsibly deploying artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) systems in high-stakes settings arguably requires not only proof of system reliability, but also continual, post-deployment monitoring to quickly detect and address any unsafe behavior. Methods for nonparametric sequential testing -- especially conformal test martingales (CTMs) and anytime-valid inference -- offer promising tools for this monitoring task. However, existing approaches are restricted to monitoring limited hypothesis classes or ``alarm criteria'' (e.g., detecting data shifts that violate certain exchangeability or IID assumptions), do not allow for online adaptation in response to shifts, and/or cannot diagnose the cause of degradation or alarm. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a weighted generalization of conformal test martingales (WCTMs), which lay a theoretical foundation for online monitoring for any unexpected changepoints in the data distribution while controlling false-alarms. For practical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms that adapt online to mild covariate shifts (in the marginal input distribution), quickly detect harmful shifts, and diagnose those harmful shifts as concept shifts (in the conditional label distribution) or extreme (out-of-support) covariate shifts that cannot be easily adapted to. On real-world datasets, we demonstrate improved performance relative to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The absence of intrinsic adjacency relations and orientation systems in hypergraphs creates fundamental challenges for constructing sheaf Laplacians of arbitrary degrees. We resolve these limitations through symmetric simplicial sets derived directly from hypergraphs, which encode all possible oriented subrelations within each hyperedge as ordered tuples. This construction canonically defines adjacency via facet maps while inherently preserving hyperedge provenance. We establish that the normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian on our induced symmetric simplicial set reduces exactly to the traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when restricted to graphs, validating its mathematical consistency with prior graph-based sheaf theory. Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all structural information from the original hypergraph, ensuring that every multi-way relational detail is faithfully retained. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion (HNSD), the first principled extension of Neural Sheaf Diffusion (NSD) to hypergraphs. HNSD operates via normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacians over symmetric simplicial sets, resolving orientation ambiguity and adjacency sparsity inherent to hypergraph learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate HNSD's competitive performance across established benchmarks.

Abstract: Post-training quantization is a key technique for reducing the memory and inference latency of large language models by quantizing weights and activations without requiring retraining. However, existing methods either (1) fail to account for the varying importance of hidden features to the end loss or, when incorporating end loss, (2) neglect the critical interactions between model weights. To address these limitations, we propose GuidedQuant, a novel quantization approach that integrates gradient information from the end loss into the quantization objective while preserving cross-weight dependencies within output channels. GuidedQuant consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art quantization methods across weight-only scalar, weight-only vector, and weight-and-activation quantization. Additionally, we introduce a novel non-uniform scalar quantization algorithm, which is guaranteed to monotonically decrease the quantization objective value, and outperforms existing methods in this category. We release the code at https://github.com/snu-mllab/GuidedQuant.

Abstract: Parametric differential equations of the form du/dt = f(u, x, t, p) are fundamental in science and engineering. While deep learning frameworks such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) can efficiently approximate solutions, they struggle with inverse problems, sensitivity estimation (du/dp), and concept drift. We address these limitations by introducing a sensitivity-based regularization strategy, called Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural Operators (SC-FNO). SC-FNO achieves high accuracy in predicting solution paths and consistently outperforms standard FNO and FNO with physics-informed regularization. It improves performance in parameter inversion tasks, scales to high-dimensional parameter spaces (tested with up to 82 parameters), and reduces both data and training requirements. These gains are achieved with a modest increase in training time (30% to 130% per epoch) and generalize across various types of differential equations and neural operators.

Abstract: Auto-regressive partial differential equation (PDE) foundation models have shown great potential in handling time-dependent data. However, these models suffer from the shortcut problem deeply rooted in auto-regressive prediction, causing error accumulation. The challenge becomes particularly evident for out-of-distribution data, as the pretraining performance may approach random model initialization for downstream tasks with long-term dynamics. To deal with this problem, we propose physics-informed temporal alignment (PITA), a self-supervised learning framework inspired by inverse problem solving. Specifically, PITA aligns the physical dynamics discovered at different time steps on each given PDE trajectory by integrating physics-informed constraints into the self-supervision signal. The alignment is derived from observation data without relying on known physics priors, indicating strong generalization ability to the out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments show that PITA significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of existing foundation models on diverse time-dependent PDE data. The code is available at https://github.com/SCAILab-USTC/PITA.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics from sparsely time-resolved snapshot data is crucial for understanding complex cellular processes and behavior. Existing methods leverage optimal transport, Schr\"odinger bridge theory, or their variants to simultaneously infer stochastic, unbalanced dynamics from snapshot data. However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to account for cell-cell interactions. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios since intercellular communications are fundamental life processes and can influence cell state-transition dynamics. To address this challenge, we formulate the Unbalanced Mean-Field Schr\"odinger Bridge (UMFSB) framework to model unbalanced stochastic interaction dynamics from snapshot data. Inspired by this framework, we further propose CytoBridge, a deep learning algorithm designed to approximate the UMFSB problem. By explicitly modeling cellular transitions, proliferation, and interactions through neural networks, CytoBridge offers the flexibility to learn these processes directly from data. The effectiveness of our method has been extensively validated using both synthetic gene regulatory data and real scRNA-seq datasets. Compared to existing methods, CytoBridge identifies growth, transition, and interaction patterns, eliminates false transitions, and reconstructs the developmental landscape with greater accuracy.

Abstract: Counterfactual learning is emerging as an important paradigm, rooted in causality, which promises to alleviate common issues of graph neural networks (GNNs), such as fairness and interpretability. However, as in many real-world application domains where conducting randomized controlled trials is impractical, one has to rely on available observational (factual) data to detect counterfactuals. In this paper, we introduce and tackle the problem of searching for counterfactual evidences for the GNN-based node classification task. A counterfactual evidence is a pair of nodes such that, regardless they exhibit great similarity both in the features and in their neighborhood subgraph structures, they are classified differently by the GNN. We develop effective and efficient search algorithms and a novel indexing solution that leverages both node features and structural information to identify counterfactual evidences, and generalizes beyond any specific GNN. Through various downstream applications, we demonstrate the potential of counterfactual evidences to enhance fairness and accuracy of GNNs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been observed to suddenly exhibit advanced reasoning abilities during reinforcement learning (RL), resembling an ``aha moment'' triggered by simple outcome-based rewards. While RL has proven effective in eliciting such breakthroughs in tasks involving mathematics, coding, and vision, it faces significant challenges in multi-scenario games. The diversity of game rules, interaction modes, and environmental complexities often leads to policies that perform well in one scenario but fail to generalize to others. Simply combining multiple scenarios during training introduces additional challenges, such as training instability and poor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Divide-Fuse-Conquer, a framework designed to enhance generalization in multi-scenario RL. This approach starts by heuristically grouping games based on characteristics such as rules and difficulties. Specialized models are then trained for each group to excel at games in the group is what we refer to as the divide step. Next, we fuse model parameters from different groups as a new model, and continue training it for multiple groups, until the scenarios in all groups are conquered. Experiments across 18 TextArena games show that Qwen2.5-32B-Align trained with the Divide-Fuse-Conquer strategy reaches a performance level comparable to Claude3.5, achieving 7 wins and 4 draws. We hope our approach can inspire future research on using reinforcement learning to improve the generalization of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate exceptional capability in tackling complex mathematical, logical, and coding tasks by leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Test-time scaling methods, such as prolonging CoT with explicit token-level exploration, can push LRMs' accuracy boundaries, but they incur significant decoding overhead. A key inefficiency source is LRMs often generate redundant thinking CoTs, which demonstrate clear structured overthinking and underthinking patterns. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning processes and numerical optimization theories, we propose TrimR, a verifier-based, training-free, efficient framework for dynamic CoT compression to trim reasoning and enhance test-time scaling, explicitly tailored for production-level deployment. Our method employs a lightweight, pretrained, instruction-tuned verifier to detect and truncate redundant intermediate thoughts of LRMs without any LRM or verifier fine-tuning. We present both the core algorithm and asynchronous online system engineered for high-throughput industrial applications. Empirical evaluations on Ascend NPUs and vLLM show that our framework delivers substantial gains in inference efficiency under large-batch workloads. In particular, on the four MATH500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA benchmarks, the reasoning runtime of Pangu Pro MoE, Pangu-R-38B, QwQ-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B is improved by up to 70% with negligible impact on accuracy.

<title>FRIREN: Beyond Trajectories -- A Spectral Lens on Time</title>

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.

Abstract: Child literacy is a strong predictor of life outcomes at the subsequent stages of an individual's life. This points to a need for targeted interventions in vulnerable low and middle income populations to help bridge the gap between literacy levels in these regions and high income ones. In this effort, reading assessments provide an important tool to measure the effectiveness of these programs and AI can be a reliable and economical tool to support educators with this task. Developing accurate automatic reading assessment systems for child speech in low-resource languages poses significant challenges due to limited data and the unique acoustic properties of children's voices. This study focuses on Xhosa, a language spoken in South Africa, to advance child speech recognition capabilities. We present a novel dataset composed of child speech samples in Xhosa. The dataset is available upon request and contains ten words and letters, which are part of the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) system. Each recording is labeled with an online and cost-effective approach by multiple markers and a subsample is validated by an independent EGRA reviewer. This dataset is evaluated with three fine-tuned state-of-the-art end-to-end models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and Whisper. The results indicate that the performance of these models can be significantly influenced by the amount and balancing of the available training data, which is fundamental for cost-effective large dataset collection. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that the wav2vec 2.0 performance is improved by training on multiple classes at a time, even when the number of available samples is constrained.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).

Abstract: The affinity and specificity of protein-molecule binding directly impact functional outcomes, uncovering the mechanisms underlying biological regulation and signal transduction. Most deep-learning-based prediction approaches focus on structures of atoms or fragments. However, quantum chemical properties, such as electronic structures, are the key to unveiling interaction patterns but remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ECBind, a method for tokenizing electron cloud signals into quantized embeddings, enabling their integration into downstream tasks such as binding affinity prediction. By incorporating electron densities, ECBind helps uncover binding modes that cannot be fully represented by atom-level models. Specifically, to remove the redundancy inherent in electron cloud signals, a structure-aware transformer and hierarchical codebooks encode 3D binding sites enriched with electron structures into tokens. These tokenized codes are then used for specific tasks with labels. To extend its applicability to a wider range of scenarios, we utilize knowledge distillation to develop an electron-cloud-agnostic prediction model. Experimentally, ECBind demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, achieving improvements of 6.42\% and 15.58\% in per-structure Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, respectively.

Abstract: Real-world medical data often includes measurements from multiple signals that are collected at irregular and asynchronous time intervals. For example, different types of blood tests can be measured at different times and frequencies, resulting in fragmented and unevenly scattered temporal data. Similar issues of irregular sampling of different attributes occur in other domains, such as monitoring of large systems using event log files or the spread of fake news on social networks. Effectively learning from such data requires models that can handle sets of temporally sparse and heterogeneous signals. In this paper, we propose Graph Mixing Additive Networks (GMAN), a novel and interpretable-by-design model for learning over irregular sets of temporal signals. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world medical tasks, including a 4-point increase in the AUROC score of in-hospital mortality prediction, compared to existing methods. We further showcase GMAN's flexibility by applying it to a fake news detection task. We demonstrate how its interpretability capabilities, including node-level, graph-level, and subset-level importance, allow for transition phases detection and gaining medical insights with real-world high-stakes implications. Finally, we provide theoretical insights on GMAN expressive power.

<title>Can Compressed LLMs Truly Act? An Empirical Evaluation of Agentic Capabilities in LLM Compression</title>

Abstract: Post-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However, existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g., perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy), ignoring the agentic capabilities - workflow, tool use/function call, long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how compression impacts LLMs' agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1) 12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation, Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ) and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B), standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves workflow generation and tool use (1%-3% drop) but degrades real-world application accuracy by 10%-15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios. The code can be found in https://github.com/pprp/ACBench.

<title>On scalable and efficient training of diffusion samplers</title>

Abstract: We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore, we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world molecular conformer generation.

Abstract: Zero-shot streaming text-to-speech is an important research topic in human-computer interaction. Existing methods primarily use a lookahead mechanism, relying on future text to achieve natural streaming speech synthesis, which introduces high processing latency. To address this issue, we propose SMLLE, a streaming framework for generating high-quality speech frame-by-frame. SMLLE employs a Transducer to convert text into semantic tokens in real time while simultaneously obtaining duration alignment information. The combined outputs are then fed into a fully autoregressive (AR) streaming model to reconstruct mel-spectrograms. To further stabilize the generation process, we design a Delete < Bos > Mechanism that allows the AR model to access future text introducing as minimal delay as possible. Experimental results suggest that the SMLLE outperforms current streaming TTS methods and achieves comparable performance over sentence-level TTS systems. Samples are available on shy-98.github.io/SMLLE_demo_page/.

Abstract: We study the problem of offline imitation learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the goal is to learn a well-performing policy given a dataset of state-action pairs generated by an expert policy. Complementing a recent line of work on this topic that assumes the expert belongs to a tractable class of known policies, we approach this problem from a new angle and leverage a different type of structural assumption about the environment. Specifically, for the class of linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs, we introduce a new algorithm called saddle-point offline imitation learning (\SPOIL), which is guaranteed to match the performance of any expert up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ with access to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples. Moreover, we extend this result to possibly non-linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs at the cost of a worse sample complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$. Finally, our analysis suggests a new loss function for training critic networks from expert data in deep imitation learning. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the neural net implementation of \SPOIL is superior to behavior cloning and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.

We give both expected and high probability regret bounds for the problem. Our result also implies an improved high-probability regret bound for the bandit linear optimization, a special case with no perturbation. We also give a lower bound on the expected regret.

Abstract: Variable binding -- the ability to associate variables with values -- is fundamental to symbolic computation and cognition. Although classical architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and (3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support, bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches. To facilitate reproducible research, we developed Variable Scope, an interactive web platform for exploring our findings at https://variablescope.org

Abstract: Estimating epistemic uncertainty in value functions is a crucial challenge for many aspects of reinforcement learning (RL), including efficient exploration, safe decision-making, and offline RL. While deep ensembles provide a robust method for quantifying value uncertainty, they come with significant computational overhead. Single-model methods, while computationally favorable, often rely on heuristics and typically require additional propagation mechanisms for myopic uncertainty estimates. In this work we introduce universal value-function uncertainties (UVU), which, similar in spirit to random network distillation (RND), quantify uncertainty as squared prediction errors between an online learner and a fixed, randomly initialized target network. Unlike RND, UVU errors reflect policy-conditional value uncertainty, incorporating the future uncertainties any given policy may encounter. This is due to the training procedure employed in UVU: the online network is trained using temporal difference learning with a synthetic reward derived from the fixed, randomly initialized target network. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our approach using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and show that in the limit of infinite network width, UVU errors are exactly equivalent to the variance of an ensemble of independent universal value functions. Empirically, we show that UVU achieves equal performance to large ensembles on challenging multi-task offline RL settings, while offering simplicity and substantial computational savings.

Abstract: Analyzing the planet at scale with satellite imagery and machine learning is a dream that has been constantly hindered by the cost of difficult-to-access highly-representative high-resolution imagery. To remediate this, we introduce here the WorldStrat dataset. The largest and most varied such publicly available dataset, at Airbus SPOT 6/7 satellites' high resolution of up to 1.5 m/pixel, empowered by European Space Agency's Phi-Lab as part of the ESA-funded QueryPlanet project, we curate nearly 10,000 sqkm of unique locations to ensure stratified representation of all types of land-use across the world: from agriculture to ice caps, from forests to multiple urbanization densities. We also enrich those with locations typically under-represented in ML datasets: sites of humanitarian interest, illegal mining sites, and settlements of persons at risk. We temporally-match each high-resolution image with multiple low-resolution images from the freely accessible lower-resolution Sentinel-2 satellites at 10 m/pixel. We accompany this dataset with an open-source Python package to: rebuild or extend the WorldStrat dataset, train and infer baseline algorithms, and learn with abundant tutorials, all compatible with the popular EO-learn toolbox. We hereby hope to foster broad-spectrum applications of ML to satellite imagery, and possibly develop from free public low-resolution Sentinel2 imagery the same power of analysis allowed by costly private high-resolution imagery. We illustrate this specific point by training and releasing several highly compute-efficient baselines on the task of Multi-Frame Super-Resolution. High-resolution Airbus imagery is CC BY-NC, while the labels and Sentinel2 imagery are CC BY, and the source code and pre-trained models under BSD. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/record/6810791 and the software package at https://github.com/worldstrat/worldstrat .

Abstract: Scoring rules promote rational and honest decision-making, which is important for model evaluation and becoming increasingly important for automated procedures such as `AutoML'. In this paper we survey common squared and logarithmic scoring rules for survival analysis, with a focus on their theoretical and empirical properness. We introduce a marginal definition of properness and show that both the Integrated Survival Brier Score (ISBS) and the Right-Censored Log-Likelihood (RCLL) are theoretically improper under this definition. We also investigate a new class of losses that may inform future survival scoring rules. Simulation experiments reveal that both the ISBS and RCLL behave as proper scoring rules in practice. The RCLL showed no violations across all settings, while ISBS exhibited only minor, negligible violations at extremely small sample sizes, suggesting one can trust results from historical experiments. As such we advocate for both the RCLL and ISBS in external validation of models, including in automated procedures. However, we note practical challenges in estimating these losses including estimation of censoring distributions and densities; as such further research is required to advance development of robust and honest evaluation in survival analysis.

Abstract: We consider the $\epsilon$-greedy strategy for the multi-arm bandit with covariates (MABC) problem, where the mean reward functions are assumed to lie in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We propose to estimate the unknown mean reward functions using an online weighted kernel ridge regression estimator, and show the resultant estimator to be consistent under appropriate decay rates of the exploration probability sequence, $\{\epsilon_t\}_t$, and regularization parameter, $\{\lambda_t\}_t$. Moreover, we show that for any choice of kernel and the corresponding RKHS, we achieve a sub-linear regret rate depending on the intrinsic dimensionality of the RKHS. Furthermore, we achieve the optimal regret rate of $\sqrt{T}$ under a margin condition for finite-dimensional RKHS.

Abstract: Large-scale medical imaging datasets have accelerated deep learning (DL) for medical image analysis. However, the large scale of these datasets poses a challenge for researchers, resulting in increased storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and accessing them. Since different researchers have different use cases and require different resolutions or formats for DL, it is neither feasible to anticipate every researcher's needs nor practical to store data in multiple resolutions and formats. To that end, we propose the Medical Image Streaming Toolkit (MIST), a format-agnostic database that enables streaming of medical images at different resolutions and formats from a single high-resolution copy. We evaluated MIST across eight popular, large-scale medical imaging datasets spanning different body parts, modalities, and formats. Our results showed that our framework reduced the storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and downloading datasets without impacting image quality. We demonstrate that MIST addresses the challenges posed by large-scale medical imaging datasets by building a data-efficient and format-agnostic database to meet the diverse needs of researchers and reduce barriers to DL research in medical imaging.

Abstract: With advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), it is now possible to produce realistic-looking automated reports for preliminary reads of radiology images. This can expedite clinical workflows, improve accuracy and reduce overall costs. However, it is also well-known that such models often hallucinate, leading to false findings in the generated reports. In this paper, we propose a new method of fact-checking of AI-generated reports using their associated images. Specifically, the developed examiner differentiates real and fake sentences in reports by learning the association between an image and sentences describing real or potentially fake findings. To train such an examiner, we first created a new dataset of fake reports by perturbing the findings in the original ground truth radiology reports associated with images. Text encodings of real and fake sentences drawn from these reports are then paired with image encodings to learn the mapping to real/fake labels. The utility of such an examiner is demonstrated for verifying automatically generated reports by detecting and removing fake sentences. Future generative AI approaches can use the resulting tool to validate their reports leading to a more responsible use of AI in expediting clinical workflows.

Abstract: The regression function is one of the key objects of binary classification, since it not only determines a Bayes optimal classifier, hence, defines an optimal decision boundary, but also encodes the conditional distribution of the output given the input. In this paper we build distribution-free confidence regions for the regression function for any user-chosen confidence level and any finite sample size based on a resampling test. These regions are abstract, as the model class can be almost arbitrary, e.g., it does not have to be finitely parameterized. We prove the strong uniform consistency of a new empirical risk minimization based approach for model classes with finite pseudo-dimensions and inverse Lipschitz parameterizations. We provide exponential probably approximately correct bounds on the $L_2$ sizes of these regions, and demonstrate the ideas on specific models. Additionally, we also consider a k-nearest neighbors based method, for which we prove strong pointwise bounds on the probability of exclusion. Finally, the constructions are illustrated on a logistic model class and compared to the asymptotic ellipsoids of the maximum likelihood estimator.

Abstract: Neural fields have become widely used in various fields, from shape representation to neural rendering, and for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). With the advent of hybrid neural field representations like Instant NGP that leverage small MLPs and explicit representations, these models train quickly and can fit large scenes. Yet in many applications like rendering and simulation, hybrid neural fields can cause noticeable and unreasonable artifacts. This is because they do not yield accurate spatial derivatives needed for these downstream applications. In this work, we propose two ways to circumvent these challenges. Our first approach is a post hoc operator that uses local polynomial fitting to obtain more accurate derivatives from pre-trained hybrid neural fields. Additionally, we also propose a self-supervised fine-tuning approach that refines the hybrid neural field to yield accurate derivatives directly while preserving the initial signal. We show applications of our method to rendering, collision simulation, and solving PDEs. We observe that using our approach yields more accurate derivatives, reducing artifacts and leading to more accurate simulations in downstream applications.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are capable of interpreting input strings as instructions, or prompts, and carry out tasks based on them. Unlike traditional learners, LLMs cannot use back-propagation to obtain feedback, and condition their output in situ in a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Many approaches to prompting and pre-training these models involve the automated generation of these prompts, also known as meta-prompting, or prompting to obtain prompts. However, they do not formally describe the properties and behavior of the LLMs themselves. We propose a theoretical framework based on category theory to generalize and describe ICL and LLM behavior when interacting with users. Our framework allows us to obtain formal results around task agnosticity and equivalence of various meta-prompting approaches. Using our framework and experimental results we argue that meta-prompting is more effective than basic prompting at generating desirable outputs.

<title>Multilingual Text-to-Image Generation Magnifies Gender Stereotypes and Prompt Engineering May Not Help You</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have recently achieved astonishing results in image quality, flexibility, and text alignment, and are consequently employed in a fast-growing number of applications. Through improvements in multilingual abilities, a larger community now has access to this technology. However, our results show that multilingual models suffer from significant gender biases just as monolingual models do. Furthermore, the natural expectation that multilingual models will provide similar results across languages does not hold up. Instead, there are important differences between languages. We propose a novel benchmark, MAGBIG, intended to foster research on gender bias in multilingual models. We use MAGBIG to investigate the effect of multilingualism on gender bias in T2I models. To this end, we construct multilingual prompts requesting portraits of people with a certain occupation or trait. Our results show that not only do models exhibit strong gender biases but they also behave differently across languages. Furthermore, we investigate prompt engineering strategies, such as indirect, neutral formulations, to mitigate these biases. Unfortunately, these approaches have limited success and result in worse text-to-image alignment. Consequently, we call for more research into diverse representations across languages in image generators, as well as into steerability to address biased model behavior.

<title>Generalization Bounds for Heavy-Tailed SDEs through the Fractional Fokker-Planck Equation</title>

Abstract: Understanding the generalization properties of heavy-tailed stochastic optimization algorithms has attracted increasing attention over the past years. While illuminating interesting aspects of stochastic optimizers by using heavy-tailed stochastic differential equations as proxies, prior works either provided expected generalization bounds, or introduced non-computable information theoretic terms. Addressing these drawbacks, in this work, we prove high-probability generalization bounds for heavy-tailed SDEs which do not contain any nontrivial information theoretic terms. To achieve this goal, we develop new proof techniques based on estimating the entropy flows associated with the so-called fractional Fokker-Planck equation (a partial differential equation that governs the evolution of the distribution of the corresponding heavy-tailed SDE). In addition to obtaining high-probability bounds, we show that our bounds have a better dependence on the dimension of parameters as compared to prior art. Our results further identify a phase transition phenomenon, which suggests that heavy tails can be either beneficial or harmful depending on the problem structure. We support our theory with experiments conducted in a variety of settings.

<title>Perturbative partial moment matching and gradient-flow adaptive importance sampling transformations for Bayesian leave one out cross-validation</title>

Abstract: Importance sampling (IS) allows one to approximate leave one out (LOO) cross-validation for a Bayesian model, without refitting, by inverting the Bayesian update equation to subtract a given data point from a model posterior. For each data point, one computes expectations under the corresponding LOO posterior by weighted averaging over the full data posterior. This task sometimes requires weight stabilization in the form of adapting the posterior distribution via transformation. So long as one is successful in finding a suitable transformation, one avoids refitting. To this end, we motivate the use of bijective perturbative transformations of the form $T(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\boldsymbol{\theta} + h Q(\boldsymbol{\theta}),$ for $0<h\ll 1,$ and introduce two classes of such transformations: 1) partial moment matching and 2) gradient flow evolution. The former extends prior literature on moment-matching under the recognition that adaptation for LOO is a small perturbation on the full data posterior. The latter class of methods define transformations based on relaxing various statistical objectives: in our case the variance of the IS estimator and the KL divergence between the transformed distribution and the statistics of the LOO fold. Being model-specific, the gradient flow transformations require evaluating Jacobian determinants. While these quantities are generally readily available through auto-differentiation, we derive closed-form expressions in the case of logistic regression and shallow ReLU activated neural networks. We tested the methodology on an $n\ll p$ dataset that is known to produce unstable LOO IS weights.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of controlling a linear system under possibly unbounded stochastic noise with unknown convex cost functions, known as an online control problem. In contrast to the existing work, which assumes the boundedness of noise, we show that an $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ high-probability regret can be achieved under unbounded noise, where $ T $ denotes the time horizon. Notably, the noise is only required to have a finite fourth moment. Moreover, when the costs are strongly convex and the noise is sub-Gaussian, we establish an $ O({\rm poly} (\log T)) $ regret bound.

<title>Certified Robustness to Clean-Label Poisoning Using Diffusion Denoising</title>

Abstract: We present a certified defense to clean-label poisoning attacks under $\ell_2$-norm. These attacks work by injecting a small number of poisoning samples (e.g., 1%) that contain bounded adversarial perturbations into the training data to induce a targeted misclassification of a test-time input. Inspired by the adversarial robustness achieved by $randomized$ $smoothing$, we show how an off-the-shelf diffusion denoising model can sanitize the tampered training data. We extensively test our defense against seven clean-label poisoning attacks in both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$-norms and reduce their attack success to 0-16% with only a negligible drop in the test accuracy. We compare our defense with existing countermeasures against clean-label poisoning, showing that the defense reduces the attack success the most and offers the best model utility. Our results highlight the need for future work on developing stronger clean-label attacks and using our certified yet practical defense as a strong baseline to evaluate these attacks.

Abstract: Detecting tricky bugs in plausible programs, those that pass existing test suites yet still contain bugs, remains a significant challenge in software testing. To address this problem, we propose TrickCatcher, an LLM-powered approach to generating test cases for uncovering bugs in plausible programs. TrickCatcher operates in three stages: First, it uses an LLM to generate program variants based on the program under test (PUT) and its specification. Second, it employs an LLM to construct an input generator from the specification for producing test inputs. Finally, these inputs are executed on both the PUT and its program variants to detect inconsistencies in their outputs. We evaluate TrickCatcher on two datasets, TrickyBugs and EvalPlus, which include 366 human-written and 151 AI-generated plausible programs with tricky bugs. TrickCatcher achieves recall, precision, and F1 scores that are 1.80x, 2.65x, and 1.66x those of the state-of-the-art baselines, respectively. Code and data used are available at https://github.com/RinCloud/TrickCatcher.

<title>Anchored Answers: Unravelling Positional Bias in GPT-2's Multiple-Choice Questions</title>

arXiv:2405.03205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT-4 and LLaMA families, have demonstrated considerable success across diverse tasks, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, these models exhibit a positional bias, particularly an even worse anchored bias in the GPT-2 family, where they consistently favour the first choice 'A' in MCQs during inference. This anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention heads, using the "logit lens" method to trace and modify the specific value vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first choice 'A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not only mitigate the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for the GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias from the failing cases in MCQs within the GPT-2 models, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that significantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ruizheliUOA/Anchored_Bias_GPT2.

<title>Enhancing Accuracy in Generative Models via Knowledge Transfer</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the accuracy of generative models and the impact of knowledge transfer on their generation precision. Specifically, we examine a generative model for a target task, fine-tuned using a pre-trained model from a source task. Building on the "Shared Embedding" concept, which bridges the source and target tasks, we introduce a novel framework for transfer learning under distribution metrics such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This framework underscores the importance of leveraging inherent similarities between diverse tasks despite their distinct data distributions. Our theory suggests that the shared structures can augment the generation accuracy for a target task, reliant on the capability of a source model to identify shared structures and effective knowledge transfer from source to target learning. To demonstrate the practical utility of this framework, we explore the theoretical implications for two specific generative models: diffusion and normalizing flows. The results show enhanced performance in both models over their non-transfer counterparts, indicating advancements for diffusion models and providing fresh insights into normalizing flows in transfer and non-transfer settings. These results highlight the significant contribution of knowledge transfer in boosting the generation capabilities of these models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrate significant potential in the medical domain and are often evaluated using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) modeled on exams like the USMLE. However, such benchmarks may overestimate true clinical understanding by rewarding pattern recognition and test-taking heuristics. To investigate this, we created a fictional medical benchmark centered on an imaginary organ, the Glianorex, allowing us to separate memorized knowledge from reasoning ability. We generated textbooks and MCQs in English and French using leading LLMs, then evaluated proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific models in a zero-shot setting. Despite the fictional content, models achieved an average score of 64%, while physicians scored only 27%. Fine-tuned medical models outperformed base models in English but not in French. Ablation and interpretability analyses revealed that models frequently relied on shallow cues, test-taking strategies, and hallucinated reasoning to identify the correct choice. These results suggest that standard MCQ-based evaluations may not effectively measure clinical reasoning and highlight the need for more robust, clinically meaningful assessment methods for LLMs.

Abstract: We construct a new representation of entropy solutions to nonlinear scalar conservation laws with a smooth convex flux function in a single spatial dimension. The representation is a generalization of the method of characteristics and posseses a compositional form. While it is a nonlinear representation, the embedded dynamics of the solution in the time variable is linear. This representation is then discretized as a manifold of implicit neural representations where the feedforward neural network architecture has a low rank structure. Finally, we show that the low rank neural representation with a fixed number of layers and a small number of coefficients can approximate any entropy solution regardless of the complexity of the shock topology, while retaining the linearity of the embedded dynamics.

Abstract: Finetuning language models (LMs) is crucial for adapting the models to downstream data and tasks. However, full finetuning is usually costly. Existing work, such as parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT), often focuses on \textit{how to finetune} but neglects the issue of \textit{where to finetune}. As a pioneering work on reducing the cost of backpropagation (at the layer level) by answering where to finetune, we conduct a semantic analysis of the LM inference process. We first propose using transition traces of the latent representation to compute deviations (or loss). Then, using a derived formula of scaling law, we estimate the gain of each layer in reducing deviation (or loss). Further, we narrow down the scope for finetuning, and also, study the cost-benefit balance of LM finetuning. We perform extensive experiments across well-known LMs and datasets. The results show that our approach is effective and efficient, and outperforms the existing baselines. Our approach is orthogonal to other techniques for improving finetuning efficiency, such as PEFT methods, offering practical values on LM finetuning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain widespread use, establishing systematic and reliable evaluation methodologies for LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs) has become essential to ensure their real-world effectiveness and reliability. There have been some early explorations about the usability of LLMs for limited urban tasks, but a systematic and scalable evaluation benchmark is still lacking. The challenge in constructing a systematic evaluation benchmark for urban research lies in the diversity of urban data, the complexity of application scenarios and the highly dynamic nature of the urban environment. In this paper, we design \textit{CityBench}, an interactive simulator based evaluation platform, as the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs for diverse tasks in urban research. First, we build \textit{CityData} to integrate the diverse urban data and \textit{CitySimu} to simulate fine-grained urban dynamics. Based on \textit{CityData} and \textit{CitySimu}, we design 8 representative urban tasks in 2 categories of perception-understanding and decision-making as the \textit{CityBench}. With extensive results from 30 well-known LLMs and VLMs in 13 cities around the world, we find that advanced LLMs and VLMs can achieve competitive performance in diverse urban tasks requiring commonsense and semantic understanding abilities, e.g., understanding the human dynamics and semantic inference of urban images. Meanwhile, they fail to solve the challenging urban tasks requiring professional knowledge and high-level numerical abilities, e.g., geospatial prediction and traffic control task.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs), with their powerful language generation and reasoning capabilities, have already achieved notable success in many domains, e.g., math and code generation. However, they often fall short when tackling real-life geospatial tasks within urban environments. This limitation stems from a lack of physical world knowledge and relevant data during training. To address this gap, we propose \textit{CityGPT}, a systematic framework designed to enhance LLMs' understanding of urban space and improve their ability to solve the related urban tasks by integrating a city-scale `world model' into the model. Firstly, we construct a diverse instruction tuning dataset, \textit{CityInstruction}, for injecting urban knowledge into LLMs and effectively boosting their spatial reasoning capabilities. Using a combination of \textit{CityInstruction} and open source general instruction data, we introduce a novel and easy-to-use self-weighted fine-tuning method (\textit{SWFT}) to train various LLMs (including ChatGLM3-6B, Llama3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B) to enhance their urban spatial capabilities without compromising, or even improving, their general abilities. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we develop a comprehensive text-based spatial benchmark \textit{CityEval} for evaluating the performance of LLMs across a wide range of urban scenarios and geospatial tasks. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that smaller LLMs trained with \textit{CityInstruction} by \textit{SWFT} method can achieve performance that is competitive with, and in some cases superior to, proprietary LLMs when assessed using \textit{CityEval}.

Abstract: With a surge of large-scale pre-trained models, parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) of large models has garnered significant attention. While promising, they commonly rely on two optimistic assumptions: 1) full access to the parameters of a PTM, and 2) sufficient memory capacity to cache all intermediate activations for gradient computation. However, in most real-world applications, PTMs serve as black-box APIs or proprietary software without full parameter accessibility. Besides, it is hard to meet a large memory requirement for modern PTMs. This work proposes black-box visual prompting (BlackVIP), which efficiently adapts the PTMs without knowledge of their architectures or parameters. BlackVIP has two components: 1) Coordinator and 2) simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation with gradient correction (SPSA-GC). The Coordinator designs input-dependent visual prompts, which allow the target PTM to adapt in the wild. SPSA-GC efficiently estimates the gradient of PTM to update Coordinator. Besides, we introduce a variant, BlackVIP-SE, which significantly reduces the runtime and computational cost of BlackVIP. Extensive experiments on 19 datasets demonstrate that BlackVIPs enable robust adaptation to diverse domains and tasks with minimal memory requirements. We further provide a theoretical analysis on the generalization of visual prompting methods by presenting their connection to the certified robustness of randomized smoothing, and presenting an empirical support for improved robustness.

Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.

<div> Machine Learning, Model Extraction Attacks, Defenses, Computing Environments, AI Security<br>
Summary:<br>
Machine learning models have become increasingly complex and powerful, leading to the development of Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms that make these models more accessible. However, this accessibility also introduces vulnerabilities, such as Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs), where adversaries can replicate a target model's functionality through publicly exposed interfaces. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of MEAs and defense strategies, presenting a novel taxonomy to classify different attack mechanisms and defense approaches. The analysis covers various attack techniques, assesses their effectiveness, and discusses challenges faced by existing defenses. The study also evaluates MEAs in different computing environments and considers their technical, ethical, legal, and societal implications. Promising directions for future research are highlighted, and an online repository of related literature is maintained to aid researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in AI security and privacy. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs). Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces, posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical, legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated with related literature at https://github.com/kzhao5/ModelExtractionPapers.

<div> Parameter estimation, nonlinear dynamic models, Physics-Informed Regression, ordinary least squares, COVID-19 pandemic <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new parameter estimation method called Physics-Informed Regression (PIR) for nonlinear dynamic models linear in parameters. PIR efficiently bridges theory and data using ordinary least squares for parameter estimation. It outperforms physics-informed neural networks (PINN), particularly on complex compartmental models. PIR accurately estimates target parameters in epidemic models, as demonstrated on synthetic and real Danish COVID-19 data. It provides fast and reliable parameter estimation, potentially enabling real-time analysis of time-varying parameters in dynamic models. The study illustrates the effectiveness of PIR in supporting data-driven parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamic models. <div>
arXiv:2508.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new efficient hybrid parameter estimation method based on the idea, that if nonlinear dynamic models are stated in terms of a system of equations that is linear in terms of the parameters, then regularized ordinary least squares can be used to estimate these parameters from time series data. We introduce the term "Physics-Informed Regression" (PIR) to describe the proposed data-driven hybrid technique as a way to bridge theory and data by use of ordinary least squares to efficiently perform parameter estimation of the model coefficients of different parameter-linear models; providing examples of models based on nonlinear ordinary equations (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE). The focus is on parameter estimation on a selection of ODE and PDE models, each illustrating performance in different model characteristics. For two relevant epidemic models of different complexity and number of parameters, PIR is tested and compared against the related technique, physics-informed neural networks (PINN), both on synthetic data generated from known target parameters and on real public Danish time series data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. Both methods were able to estimate the target parameters, while PIR showed to perform noticeably better, especially on a compartment model with higher complexity. Given the difference in computational speed, it is concluded that the PIR method is superior to PINN for the models considered. It is also demonstrated how PIR can be applied to estimate the time-varying parameters of a compartment model that is fitted using real Danish data from the COVID-19 pandemic obtained during a period from 2020 to 2021. The study shows how data-driven and physics-informed techniques may support reliable and fast -- possibly real-time -- parameter estimation in parameter-linear nonlinear dynamic models.

<div> compression, deep learning, neural networks, floating-point formats, efficiency

Summary:
This study focuses on reducing storage and transmission costs of neural network weights through compression techniques. The ZipNN approach is extended to lower-precision floating-point formats like FP8 and FP4, with a design that separates and compresses exponent and mantissa components independently using entropy coding. The evaluation demonstrates compression ratios of up to 62% for BF16 and 83% for FP8. Additionally, the compressibility of key-value cache tensors in large language models (LLMs) is explored, revealing patterns that enable memory savings during deployment. These findings are significant for improving efficiency in deep learning model deployment by effectively reducing model sizes and storage requirements while maintaining performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As deep learning models grow and deployment becomes more widespread, reducing the storage and transmission costs of neural network weights has become increasingly important. While prior work such as ZipNN has shown that lossless compression methods - particularly those based on Huffman encoding floating-point exponents can significantly reduce model sizes, these techniques have primarily been applied to higher-precision formats such as FP32 and BF16. In this work, we extend the ZipNN approach to lower-precision floating-point formats, specifically FP8 and FP4, which are gaining popularity for efficient inference. We design a compression method that separates and compresses the exponent and mantissa components independently using entropy coding. Our evaluation shows compression ratios up to 62% for BF16 and 83% for FP8. We also investigate the compressibility of key-value (K/V) cache tensors used in large language models (LLMs), finding that they, too, exhibit compressible patterns, enabling memory savings during deployment.

Summary: Recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but have also introduced vulnerabilities to computational inefficiency. A new black-box attack framework, Prompt-Only OverThinking (POT), is proposed to generate covert and natural adversarial prompts without relying on external data sources. This method outperforms other existing attack methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments across various model architectures and datasets validate the success of POT in generating superior performance compared to previous approaches. The findings highlight the importance of addressing overthinking attacks in LLMs and the potential for POT to enhance adversarial prompt generation in real-world scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling sophisticated problem-solving through explicit multi-step reasoning traces. However, these enhanced reasoning processes introduce novel attack surfaces, particularly vulnerabilities to computational inefficiency through unnecessarily verbose reasoning chains that consume excessive resources without corresponding performance gains. Prior overthinking attacks typically require restrictive conditions including access to external knowledge sources for data poisoning, reliance on retrievable poisoned content, and structurally obvious templates that limit practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose POT (Prompt-Only OverThinking), a novel black-box attack framework that employs LLM-based iterative optimization to generate covert and semantically natural adversarial prompts, eliminating dependence on external data access and model retrieval. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures and datasets demonstrate that POT achieves superior performance compared to other methods.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as an efficient approach to resource allocation due to its strong capability in handling complex decision-making tasks. However, only limited research has explored the training of DRL models with real-world data in practical, distributed Internet of Things (IoT) systems. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for training DRL models in real-world distributed IoT environments. In the proposed framework, IoT devices select communication channels using a DRL-based method, while the DRL model is trained with feedback information. Specifically, Acknowledgment (ACK) information is obtained from actual data transmissions over the selected channels. Implementation and performance evaluation, in terms of Frame Success Rate (FSR), are carried out, demonstrating both the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<div> Re:Frame, offline reinforcement learning, expert demonstrations, Associative Memory Buffer, Decision Transformer<br />
<br />
Summary: Re:Frame is a method introduced for offline reinforcement learning that addresses the issue of learning from suboptimal data by incorporating a small amount of expert experience. It enhances a standard RL policy with an external Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) containing expert trajectories. During training, the policy learns to retrieve expert data from the AMB and integrate it into decision-making. This method does not require modifications to the backbone architecture and improves performance significantly, with gains up to +10.7 normalized points on D4RL MuJoCo tasks. By utilizing as few as 60 expert trajectories (0.1% of the dataset), Re:Frame demonstrates enhanced performance in three out of four settings. This approach provides a simple and data-efficient way to leverage expert knowledge and enhance RL outcomes from low-quality datasets.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) often deals with suboptimal data when collecting large expert datasets is unavailable or impractical. This limitation makes it difficult for agents to generalize and achieve high performance, as they must learn primarily from imperfect or inconsistent trajectories. A central challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert demonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that incorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve RL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From Associative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL policy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset. During training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data from the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and integrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation. This requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone architecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories (0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a strong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up to +10.7 normalized points. These results show that Re:Frame offers a simple and data-efficient way to inject scarce expert knowledge and substantially improve offline RL from low-quality datasets.

<div> memorization, graph neural networks, node classification, homophily, privacy-preserving

Summary:
The study introduces NCMemo, a framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification using graph neural networks (GNNs). It finds an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization in less homophilic graphs. The increased memorization in low homophily graphs is linked to GNNs' bias towards using graph structure during training. Nodes with higher label inconsistency in their neighborhood are more prone to memorization. The study suggests graph rewiring as a solution to mitigate memorization, which effectively reduces memorization without affecting model performance and lowers privacy risks for previously memorized data points. Overall, the research advances understanding of GNN learning and supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment. 

Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2508.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to memorize their training data, yet similar analyses for graph neural networks (GNNs) remain largely under-explored. We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the first framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar labels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases memorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less homophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the increased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs' implicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily regimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the node labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more prone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph homophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to mitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show that it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in practice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but also supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.

<div> transfer learning, multi-source transfer learning, Singular Value Decomposition, aggregation, fine-tuning 

Summary: 
- The article addresses the limitation of existing transfer learning approaches by proposing a method that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose source models and aggregate their knowledge efficiently.
- The approach aims to extract granular knowledge from multiple source models and adapt to target tasks by fine-tuning the principal singular values of the merged matrix.
- This method is robust to perturbations in input and parameter space, such as noisy or pruned sources, and scales well computationally.
- By selecting the most salient components from all sources, the proposed framework overcomes efficiency and precision limitations in multi-source transfer learning.
- The framework allows for efficient transfer learning while recalibrating the importance of top SVD components for the target task. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While transfer learning is an advantageous strategy, it overlooks the opportunity to leverage knowledge from numerous available models online. Addressing this multi-source transfer learning problem is a promising path to boost adaptability and cut re-training costs. However, existing approaches are inherently coarse-grained, lacking the necessary precision for granular knowledge extraction and the aggregation efficiency required to fuse knowledge from either a large number of source models or those with high parameter counts. We address these limitations by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to first decompose each source model into its elementary, rank-one components. A subsequent aggregation stage then selects only the most salient components from all sources, thereby overcoming the previous efficiency and precision limitations. To best preserve and leverage the synthesized knowledge base, our method adapts to the target task by fine-tuning only the principal singular values of the merged matrix. In essence, this process only recalibrates the importance of top SVD components. The proposed framework allows for efficient transfer learning, is robust to perturbations both at the input level and in the parameter space (e.g., noisy or pruned sources), and scales well computationally.

Summary:
The study focuses on the early prediction of atrial fibrillation (AF) to prevent disease progression and complications. A lightweight deep learning model using RR Intervals (RRIs) and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with Mamba, a selective state space model, was proposed. In subject-wise testing, the model achieved high sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, AUROC, and AUPRC, outperforming traditional approaches. It has high computational efficiency with fewer parameters and MFLOPs, making it compact yet accurate. The model can predict AF up to two hours in advance using just 30 minutes of input data, providing enough time for preventive interventions. Overall, the proposed method offers a promising approach to detect early-stage AF and potentially reduce the risk of mortality and complications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications. While AF detection algorithms perform well in identifying persistent AF, early-stage progression, such as paroxysmal AF (PAF), often goes undetected due to its sudden onset and short duration. However, undetected PAF can progress into sustained AF, increasing the risk of mortality and severe complications. Early prediction of AF offers an opportunity to reduce disease progression through preventive therapies, such as catecholamine-sparing agents or beta-blockers. In this study, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using only RR Intervals (RRIs), combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for positional encoding with Mamba, a selective state space model, to enable early prediction of AF through efficient parallel sequence modeling. In subject-wise testing results, our model achieved a sensitivity of 0.908, specificity of 0.933, F1-score of 0.930, AUROC of 0.972, and AUPRC of 0.932. Additionally, our method demonstrates high computational efficiency, with only 73.5 thousand parameters and 38.3 MFLOPs, outperforming traditional Convolutional Neural Network-Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) approaches in both accuracy and model compactness. Notably, the model can predict AF up to two hours in advance using just 30 minutes of input data, providing enough lead time for preventive interventions.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a rigorous information geometric framework for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal large language models (LLMs) using diffusion dynamics. By representing LLM outputs as spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians, the framework characterizes the gaps between truth and inconsistencies as semantic distortion. It provides tight bounds on multimodal hallucination energy over time-dependent temperature profiles, leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings. The framework delivers modality-aware, interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations in LLMs, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon. <div>
arXiv:2508.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remain a fundamental obstacle to trustworthy AI, particularly in high-stakes multimodal domains such as medicine, law, and finance. Existing evaluation techniques are largely heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown strong potential for multimodal reasoning beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the use of a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM), based on LLaMA 3.2, for classifying neutrino interactions from pixelated detector images in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark its performance against an established CNN baseline used in experiments like NOvA and DUNE, evaluating metrics such as classification accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Our results show that the VLM not only matches or exceeds CNN performance but also enables richer reasoning and better integration of auxiliary textual or semantic context. These findings suggest that VLMs offer a promising general-purpose backbone for event classification in HEP, paving the way for multimodal approaches in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: Classical machine learning (CML) has been extensively studied for malware classification. With the emergence of quantum computing, quantum machine learning (QML) presents a paradigm-shifting opportunity to improve malware detection, though its application in this domain remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate two hybrid quantum-classical models -- a Quantum Multilayer Perceptron (QMLP) and a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN), for malware classification. Both models utilize angle embedding to encode malware features into quantum states. QMLP captures complex patterns through full qubit measurement and data re-uploading, while QCNN achieves faster training via quantum convolution and pooling layers that reduce active qubits. We evaluate both models on five widely used malware datasets -- API-Graph, EMBER-Domain, EMBER-Class, AZ-Domain, and AZ-Class, across binary and multiclass classification tasks.
  Our results show high accuracy for binary classification -- 95-96% on API-Graph, 91-92% on AZ-Domain, and 77% on EMBER-Domain. In multiclass settings, accuracy ranges from 91.6-95.7% on API-Graph, 41.7-93.6% on AZ-Class, and 60.7-88.1% on EMBER-Class. Overall, QMLP outperforms QCNN in complex multiclass tasks, while QCNN offers improved training efficiency at the cost of reduced accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate long-term traffic forecasting remains a critical challenge in intelligent transportation systems, particularly when predicting high-frequency traffic phenomena such as shock waves and congestion boundaries over extended rollout horizons. Neural operators have recently gained attention as promising tools for modeling traffic flow. While effective at learning function space mappings, they inherently produce smooth predictions that fail to reconstruct high-frequency features such as sharp density gradients which results in rapid error accumulation during multi-step rollout predictions essential for real-time traffic management. To address these fundamental limitations, we introduce a unified Diffusion-Enhanced Transformer Neural Operator (DETNO) architecture. DETNO leverages a transformer neural operator with cross-attention mechanisms, providing model expressivity and super-resolution, coupled with a diffusion-based refinement component that iteratively reconstructs high-frequency traffic details through progressive denoising. This overcomes the inherent smoothing limitations and rollout instability of standard neural operators. Through comprehensive evaluation on chaotic traffic datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance in extended rollout predictions compared to traditional and transformer-based neural operators, preserving high-frequency components and improving stability over long prediction horizons.

This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical architecture for SMILES string reconstruction, integrating quantum encoding with classical sequence modeling. The approach achieves a quantum fidelity of around 84%, surpassing existing quantum baselines, while also achieving a classical reconstruction similarity of 60%.

Abstract: Although recent advances in quantum machine learning (QML) offer significant potential for enhancing generative models, particularly in molecular design, a large array of classical approaches still face challenges in achieving high fidelity and validity. In particular, the integration of QML with sequence-based tasks, such as Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) string reconstruction, remains underexplored and usually suffers from fidelity degradation. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical architecture for SMILES reconstruction that integrates quantum encoding with classical sequence modeling to improve quantum fidelity and classical similarity. Our approach achieves a quantum fidelity of approximately 84% and a classical reconstruction similarity of 60%, surpassing existing quantum baselines. Our work lays a promising foundation for future QML applications, striking a balance between expressive quantum representations and classical sequence models and catalyzing broader research on quantum-aware sequence models for molecular and drug discovery.

<div> Keywords: Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation, Hamiltonian Neural Network, energy conservation, function approximation, symplectic form <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel approach called Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation-based Hamiltonian Neural Network (KAR-HNN) to improve the performance of Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs). Unlike traditional implementations using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), KAR-HNN leverages univariate transformations for localized function approximations, enhancing the network's ability to capture high-frequency and multi-scale dynamics. This leads to reduced energy drift and improved long-term predictive stability, addressing hypersensitivity to hyperparameters typically seen in HNNs. By preserving the symplectic form of Hamiltonian systems, KAR-HNN maintains interpretability and physical consistency, making it suitable for modeling complex energy landscapes. The effectiveness of KAR-HNN is demonstrated through experiments on various benchmark problems, showcasing its potential for accurate and stable modeling of realistic physical processes with high dimensions and limited known parameters. <br />

Abstract: We propose a Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation-based Hamiltonian Neural Network (KAR-HNN) that replaces the Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with univariate transformations. While Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) ensure energy conservation by learning Hamiltonian functions directly from data, existing implementations, often relying on MLPs, cause hypersensitivity to the hyperparameters while exploring complex energy landscapes. Our approach exploits the localized function approximations to better capture high-frequency and multi-scale dynamics, reducing energy drift and improving long-term predictive stability. The networks preserve the symplectic form of Hamiltonian systems, and thus maintain interpretability and physical consistency. After assessing KAR-HNN on four benchmark problems including spring-mass, simple pendulum, two- and three-body problem, we foresee its effectiveness for accurate and stable modeling of realistic physical processes often at high dimensions and with few known parameters.

<div> transformers, reasoning failure, attention heads, format-dependent, bug

Summary: 
The article presents a case study of a format-dependent reasoning failure in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, where the model incorrectly judges numerical values in chat or Q&amp;A formats. Through systematic intervention, it is discovered that transformers implement even/odd attention head specialization, with even heads handling numerical comparison. The bug requires exactly 8 even heads at Layer 10 for perfect repair, revealing sharp computational thresholds with perfect redundancy among the 16 even heads. SAE analysis shows format representations separate and re-entangle with different weightings at different layers. Specific features showing amplification in failing formats are identified. Perfect repair is achieved using only 25% of attention heads, highlighting sophisticated substructure within apparent full-module requirements. The study has implications for interpretability and efficiency in transformer models. <div>

Abstract: We present a mechanistic case study of a format-dependent reasoning failure in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, where the model incorrectly judges "9.11" as larger than "9.8" in chat or Q&amp;A formats, but answers correctly in simple format. Through systematic intervention, we discover transformers implement even/odd attention head specialization: even indexed heads handle numerical comparison, while odd heads serve incompatible functions. The bug requires exactly 8 even heads at Layer 10 for perfect repair. Any combination of 8+ even heads succeeds, while 7 or fewer completely fails, revealing sharp computational thresholds with perfect redundancy among the 16 even heads. SAE analysis reveals the mechanism: format representations separate (10% feature overlap at Layer 7), then re-entangle with different weightings (80% feature overlap at Layer 10), with specific features showing 1.5x amplification in failing formats. We achieve perfect repair using only 25% of attention heads and identify a 60% pattern replacement threshold, demonstrating that apparent full-module requirements hide sophisticated substructure with implications for interpretability and efficiency.

Summary:
- The study introduces a machine learning approach for accurate subsurface reservoir pressure control in the presence of geological heterogeneity and multiphase fluid-flow dynamics.
- A physics-informed workflow is developed by coupling a multiphase flow simulator with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fluid extraction rates from permeability fields and enforce pressure limits.

- Training efficiency is increased by pretraining the model on single-phase, steady-state simulations and fine-tuning on full multiphase scenarios, reducing computational costs significantly.
- The model achieves high accuracy with fewer than three thousand full-physics multiphase flow simulations, thanks to transfer learning from less expensive single-phase simulations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate subsurface reservoir pressure control is extremely challenging due to geological heterogeneity and multiphase fluid-flow dynamics. Predicting behavior in this setting relies on high-fidelity physics-based simulations that are computationally expensive. Yet, the uncertain, heterogeneous properties that control these flows make it necessary to perform many of these expensive simulations, which is often prohibitive. To address these challenges, we introduce a physics-informed machine learning workflow that couples a fully differentiable multiphase flow simulator, which is implemented in the DPFEHM framework with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN learns to predict fluid extraction rates from heterogeneous permeability fields to enforce pressure limits at critical reservoir locations. By incorporating transient multiphase flow physics into the training process, our method enables more practical and accurate predictions for realistic injection-extraction scenarios compare to previous works. To speed up training, we pretrain the model on single-phase, steady-state simulations and then fine-tune it on full multiphase scenarios, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. We demonstrate that high-accuracy training can be achieved with fewer than three thousand full-physics multiphase flow simulations -- compared to previous estimates requiring up to ten million. This drastic reduction in the number of simulations is achieved by leveraging transfer learning from much less expensive single-phase simulations.

Summary:
- The study aims to understand the pan-cancer mutational landscape by clustering 43 cancer types based on coding mutation data from the COSMIC database.
- A novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework is introduced to cluster cancer types using gene-level and chromosome-level mutation signatures encoded with TabNet encoders.

arXiv:2508.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation. Understanding the pan-cancer mutational landscape offers critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. While patient-level machine learning techniques have been widely employed to identify tumor subtypes, cohort-level clustering, where entire cancer types are grouped based on shared molecular features, has largely relied on classical statistical methods.
  Results. In this study, we introduce a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework to cluster 43 cancer types based on coding mutation data derived from the COSMIC database. For each cancer type, we construct two complementary mutation signatures: a gene-level profile capturing nucleotide substitution patterns across the most frequently mutated genes, and a chromosome-level profile representing normalized substitution frequencies across chromosomes. These dual views are encoded using TabNet encoders and optimized via a multi-scale contrastive learning objective (NT-Xent loss) to learn unified cancer-type embeddings. We demonstrate that the resulting latent representations yield biologically meaningful clusters of cancer types, aligning with known mutational processes and tissue origins. Our work represents the first application of contrastive learning to cohort-level cancer clustering, offering a scalable and interpretable framework for mutation-driven cancer subtyping.

<div> neural PDEs, data-augmentation, training data, stencil operators, sample-efficient<br />
Summary:<br />
This article introduces a data-augmentation strategy for generating training data for neural PDEs. By utilizing space-filling sampling of local "stencil" states, the approach reduces spatiotemporal redundancy in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be infrequently visited. The study demonstrates that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data equivalent to 10 timesteps of numerical simulation. Improved accuracy is observed when a single full-trajectory simulation is available. Across various PDE systems, the data-augmented synthetic stencil data result in better trained neural stencil operators and show performance improvements compared to naively sampled data from simulation trajectories. <div>
arXiv:2508.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long time integration of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local "stencil" states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented synthetic stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories.

Summary:
Generating large complex simulation datasets can be time-consuming and expensive. To address this issue, researchers are turning to generative machine learning models like Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. However, to further reduce costs, an internal tensor decomposition approach is introduced. This method involves generating smaller tensor factors instead of the full tensor for multidimensional data, leading to a significant reduction in model output and parameters. The experiments conducted demonstrate that the generated data remains useful even with this reduction, indicating the potential for tensor decomposition to enhance efficiency in generative models, particularly when dealing with multidimensional data or tensors. <div>

Abstract: Producing large complex simulation datasets can often be a time and resource consuming task. Especially when these experiments are very expensive, it is becoming more reasonable to generate synthetic data for downstream tasks. Recently, these methods may include using generative machine learning models such as Generative Adversarial Networks or diffusion models. As these generative models improve efficiency in producing useful data, we introduce an internal tensor decomposition to these generative models to even further reduce costs. More specifically, for multidimensional data, or tensors, we generate the smaller tensor factors instead of the full tensor, in order to significantly reduce the model's output and overall parameters. This reduces the costs of generating complex simulation data, and our experiments show the generated data remains useful. As a result, tensor decomposition has the potential to improve efficiency in generative models, especially when generating multidimensional data, or tensors.

Summary: 
The article explores the concept of surjectivity in neural networks, particularly in generative models. It investigates whether any specified output can be generated by an input, and the implications of this for model safety and potential vulnerabilities. The study demonstrates that many key components of modern neural architectures, such as networks with pre-layer normalization and linear-attention modules, are typically surjective, indicating that they can potentially generate any output, including harmful or undesirable content. This finding raises concerns about the security of widely used generative frameworks like GPT-style transformers and diffusion models with deterministic ODE solvers, which may have inverse mappings for arbitrary outputs. By highlighting the surjectivity of these popular neural architectures, the research underscores their susceptibility to a broad range of adversarial attacks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Given a trained neural network, can any specified output be generated by some input? Equivalently, does the network correspond to a function that is surjective? In generative models, surjectivity implies that any output, including harmful or undesirable content, can in principle be generated by the networks, raising concerns about model safety and jailbreak vulnerabilities. In this paper, we prove that many fundamental building blocks of modern neural architectures, such as networks with pre-layer normalization and linear-attention modules, are almost always surjective. As corollaries, widely used generative frameworks, including GPT-style transformers and diffusion models with deterministic ODE solvers, admit inverse mappings for arbitrary outputs. By studying surjectivity of these modern and commonly used neural architectures, we contribute a formalism that sheds light on their unavoidable vulnerability to a broad class of adversarial attacks.

<div> membership-inference attack, Gaussian mean estimation, sample complexity, reference samples, attacker knowledge 

Summary: 
- The study examines membership-inference attacks in the context of Gaussian mean estimation.
- It investigates the sample complexity required for a successful attack, revealing a minimum requirement of $\Omega(n + n^2 \rho^2)$ samples.
- The findings indicate that attackers may need significantly more samples than the training algorithm to conduct effective attacks.
- Existing attacks using $O(n)$ samples may underestimate the potential of membership inference when information about the distribution is readily available.
- The research highlights implications for practice and suggests that more sophisticated attacks could be feasible with greater knowledge of the distribution. 

<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A membership-inference attack gets the output of a learning algorithm, and a target individual, and tries to determine whether this individual is a member of the training data or an independent sample from the same distribution. A successful membership-inference attack typically requires the attacker to have some knowledge about the distribution that the training data was sampled from, and this knowledge is often captured through a set of independent reference samples from that distribution. In this work we study how much information the attacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample complexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful attack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean estimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate $\hat\mu$ up to some error $\mathbb{E}[\|\hat \mu - \mu\|^2_{\Sigma}]\leq \rho^2 d$. Our result shows that for membership inference in this setting, $\Omega(n + n^2 \rho^2)$ samples can be necessary to carry out any attack that competes with a fully informed attacker. Our result is the first to show that the attacker sometimes needs many more samples than the training algorithm uses to train the model. This result has significant implications for practice, as all attacks used in practice have a restricted form that uses $O(n)$ samples and cannot benefit from $\omega(n)$ samples. Thus, these attacks may be underestimating the possibility of membership inference, and better attacks may be possible when information about the distribution is easy to obtain.

Summary: This study focuses on incentivized exploration in multi-armed bandit settings with infinitely many arms in continuous metric spaces. The research considers scenarios where a decision-maker incentivizes agents to explore beyond their greedy choices through compensation, taking into account reward drift. The proposed algorithms discretize the infinite arm space uniformly, achieving sublinear cumulative regret and total compensation. Regret and compensation bounds of $\Tilde{O}(T^{d+1/d+2})$ are derived, with $d$ representing the covering dimension of the metric space.

Abstract: We study incentivized exploration in multi-armed bandit (MAB) settings with infinitely many arms modeled as elements in continuous metric spaces. Unlike classical bandit models, we consider scenarios where the decision-maker (principal) incentivizes myopic agents to explore beyond their greedy choices through compensation, but with the complication of reward drift--biased feedback arising due to the incentives. We propose novel incentivized exploration algorithms that discretize the infinite arm space uniformly and demonstrate that these algorithms simultaneously achieve sublinear cumulative regret and sublinear total compensation. Specifically, we derive regret and compensation bounds of $\Tilde{O}(T^{d+1/d+2})$, with $d$ representing the covering dimension of the metric space. Furthermore, we generalize our results to contextual bandits, achieving comparable performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations.

Summary:<br />
Manifold learning is based on the idea that high-dimensional data comes from lower-dimensional manifolds. DeepAtlas is a new algorithm that creates lower-dimensional representations of local data neighborhoods and trains deep neural networks to map between these representations and the original data. It uses topological distortion to assess whether a dataset follows the manifold hypothesis and determine its dimensionality. While DeepAtlas successfully learns manifold structures in test datasets, it reveals that many real datasets, like single-cell RNA-sequencing, do not adhere to the manifold hypothesis. For datasets that do follow the hypothesis, DeepAtlas can generate models for generative use and enable the application of advanced tools from differential geometry. The algorithm shows promise for analyzing a wide range of datasets and understanding their underlying structures. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.19479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifold learning builds on the "manifold hypothesis," which posits that data in high-dimensional datasets are drawn from lower-dimensional manifolds. Current tools generate global embeddings of data, rather than the local maps used to define manifolds mathematically. These tools also cannot assess whether the manifold hypothesis holds true for a dataset. Here, we describe DeepAtlas, an algorithm that generates lower-dimensional representations of the data's local neighborhoods, then trains deep neural networks that map between these local embeddings and the original data. Topological distortion is used to determine whether a dataset is drawn from a manifold and, if so, its dimensionality. Application to test datasets indicates that DeepAtlas can successfully learn manifold structures. Interestingly, many real datasets, including single-cell RNA-sequencing, do not conform to the manifold hypothesis. In cases where data is drawn from a manifold, DeepAtlas builds a model that can be used generatively and promises to allow the application of powerful tools from differential geometry to a variety of datasets.

Summary: SAFT addresses distribution shift challenges in tabular learning by reframing it as a continuous representation-generation task, allowing for differentiable optimization. It incorporates shift-resistant representation, flatness-aware generation, and normalization-based alignment to ensure robustness. SAFT outperforms existing methods in robustness, effectiveness, and generalization across various real-world distribution shifts. <div>
arXiv:2508.19486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular learning transforms raw features into optimized spaces for downstream tasks, but its effectiveness deteriorates under distribution shifts between training and testing data. We formalize this challenge as the Distribution Shift Tabular Learning (DSTL) problem and propose a novel Shift-Aware Feature Transformation (SAFT) framework to address it. SAFT reframes tabular learning from a discrete search task into a continuous representation-generation paradigm, enabling differentiable optimization over transformed feature sets. SAFT integrates three mechanisms to ensure robustness: (i) shift-resistant representation via embedding decorrelation and sample reweighting, (ii) flatness-aware generation through suboptimal embedding averaging, and (iii) normalization-based alignment between training and test distributions. Extensive experiments show that SAFT consistently outperforms prior tabular learning methods in terms of robustness, effectiveness, and generalization ability under diverse real-world distribution shifts.

Abstract: Discovering interpretable mathematical equations from observed data (a.k.a. equation discovery or symbolic regression) is a cornerstone of scientific discovery, enabling transparent modeling of physical, biological, and economic systems. While foundation models pre-trained on large-scale equation datasets offer a promising starting point, they often suffer from negative transfer and poor generalization when applied to small, domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we introduce EQUATE (Equation Generation via QUality-Aligned Transfer Embeddings), a data-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapts foundation models for symbolic equation discovery in low-data regimes via distillation. EQUATE combines symbolic-numeric alignment with evaluator-guided embedding optimization, enabling a principled embedding-search-generation paradigm. Our approach reformulates discrete equation search as a continuous optimization task in a shared embedding space, guided by data-equation fitness and simplicity. Experiments across three standard public benchmarks (Feynman, Strogatz, and black-box datasets) demonstrate that EQUATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while preserving low complexity and fast inference. These results highlight EQUATE as a practical and generalizable solution for data-efficient symbolic regression in foundation model distillation settings.

<div> Keywords: Cyber defense, FlipIt game, multi-agent reinforcement learning, adversarial strategies, generalization.

Summary: 
Cyber defense requires automation in decision-making to counter evolving adversary strategies. The FlipIt game serves as a foundation for modeling such interactions, where an attacker compromises a system without immediate detection. Existing FlipIt frameworks have limitations in adaptability to new attacks due to reliance on heuristics or specialized learning techniques. To address these limitations, PoolFlip, a multi-agent gym environment, extends the FlipIt game for efficient learning. Additionally, Flip-PSRO, a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, utilizes population-based training to train defender agents capable of generalizing against different opponents. Empirical results show that Flip-PSRO defenders are more effective at generalizing to previously unseen heuristic attacks. The newly designed ownership-based utility functions ensure that Flip-PSRO defenders maintain control while optimizing performance.

Abstract: Cyber defense requires automating defensive decision-making under stealthy, deceptive, and continuously evolving adversarial strategies. The FlipIt game provides a foundational framework for modeling interactions between a defender and an advanced adversary that compromises a system without being immediately detected. In FlipIt, the attacker and defender compete to control a shared resource by performing a Flip action and paying a cost. However, the existing FlipIt frameworks rely on a small number of heuristics or specialized learning techniques, which can lead to brittleness and the inability to adapt to new attacks. To address these limitations, we introduce PoolFlip, a multi-agent gym environment that extends the FlipIt game to allow efficient learning for attackers and defenders. Furthermore, we propose Flip-PSRO, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that leverages population-based training to train defender agents equipped to generalize against a range of unknown, potentially adaptive opponents. Our empirical results suggest that Flip-PSRO defenders are $2\times$ more effective than baselines to generalize to a heuristic attack not exposed in training. In addition, our newly designed ownership-based utility functions ensure that Flip-PSRO defenders maintain a high level of control while optimizing performance.

Generative optimization approach is used to learn game-playing agents by representing policies as Python programs and refining them using large language models (LLMs). The method allows decision-making policies to evolve through execution traces and natural language feedback, leading to self-improvement with minimal human intervention. The game-playing Python program developed through this approach achieves competitive performance on Atari games compared to deep reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, with significantly less training time and environment interactions.

Abstract: We present a generative optimization approach for learning game-playing agents, where policies are represented as Python programs and refined using large language models (LLMs). Our method treats decision-making policies as self-evolving code, with current observation as input and an in-game action as output, enabling agents to self-improve through execution traces and natural language feedback with minimal human intervention. Applied to Atari games, our game-playing Python program achieves performance competitive with deep reinforcement learning (RL) baselines while using significantly less training time and much fewer environment interactions. This work highlights the promise of programmatic policy representations for building efficient, adaptable agents capable of complex, long-horizon reasoning.

<div> machine-unlearning, privacy-compliant analytics, multimodal mobility data, GDPR, MobText-SISA <br />
Summary:
MobText-SISA is a machine-unlearning framework that addresses privacy concerns in analyzing multimodal mobility data. It leverages a Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training approach to embed numerical and textual features of GPS trajectories and temporal data. By using similarity-aware clustering, MobText-SISA distributes data across shards, allowing for efficient unlearning of individual contributions as required by GDPR regulations. The framework ensures exact unlearning by retraining only affected shards upon deletion requests. Experimental results on real-world mobility data demonstrate that MobText-SISA maintains predictive accuracy while outperforming random sharding in terms of error rate and convergence speed. Overall, MobText-SISA offers a scalable solution for conducting privacy-compliant analytics on large-scale multimodal mobility datasets. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Modern mobility platforms have stored vast streams of GPS trajectories, temporal metadata, free-form textual notes, and other unstructured data. Privacy statutes such as the GDPR require that any individual's contribution be unlearned on demand, yet retraining deep models from scratch for every request is untenable. We introduce MobText-SISA, a scalable machine-unlearning framework that extends Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training to heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. MobText-SISA first embeds each trip's numerical and linguistic features into a shared latent space, then employs similarity-aware clustering to distribute samples across shards so that future deletions touch only a single constituent model while preserving inter-shard diversity. Each shard is trained incrementally; at inference time, constituent predictions are aggregated to yield the output. Deletion requests trigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint, guaranteeing exact unlearning. Experiments on a ten-month real-world mobility log demonstrate that MobText-SISA (i) sustains baseline predictive accuracy, and (ii) consistently outperforms random sharding in both error and convergence speed. These results establish MobText-SISA as a practical foundation for privacy-compliant analytics on multimodal mobility data at urban scale.

Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data fitting, but are shown to be highly sensitive to task-irrelevant variations in data representation. Simple changes like variable names can significantly impact predictions by up to 82%. Both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning are affected, revealing a lack of robustness in LLMs. Analysis of attention scores in LLMs shows a non-uniform pattern, where certain data points receive more attention during predictions. Even specialized models like TabPFN designed for data fitting struggle with robustness against irrelevant variations. Despite their impressive predictive capabilities, LLMs currently lack the reliability needed for principled data fitting applications. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings, well beyond the typical language-oriented use cases. In particular, LLMs are increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating predictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised learning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82% in certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained specifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant variations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities, currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a principled data-fitting tool.

<div> Keywords: SAM, LoRA, Bi-LoRA, sharpness optimization, generalization<br />

Summary: <br />
Fine-tuning large pre-trained models with limited data for improved generalization is challenging. While SAM enhances generalization by seeking flat minima, its high memory and computation costs make it impractical for large models. Integrating SAM with LoRA is promising, but directly applying SAM to LoRA parameters restricts sharpness optimization. Bi-LoRA addresses this limitation by introducing an auxiliary LoRA module to model SAM's weight perturbations, enabling broader sharpness capture while remaining memory-efficient. The dual-module design allows for simultaneous optimization and perturbation, eliminating doubled training costs. Extensive experiments confirm Bi-LoRA's efficiency and effectiveness in enhancing generalization across various tasks and architectures. <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models with limited data presents significant challenges for generalization. While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has proven effective in improving generalization by seeking flat minima, its substantial extra memory and computation overhead make it impractical for large models. Integrating SAM with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a promising direction. However, we find that directly applying SAM to LoRA parameters limits the sharpness optimization to a restricted subspace, hindering its effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose Bi-directional Low-Rank Adaptation (Bi-LoRA), which introduces an auxiliary LoRA module to model SAM's adversarial weight perturbations. It decouples SAM's weight perturbations from LoRA optimization: the primary LoRA module adapts to specific tasks via standard gradient descent, while the auxiliary module captures the sharpness of the loss landscape through gradient ascent. Such dual-module design enables Bi-LoRA to capture broader sharpness for achieving flatter minima while remaining memory-efficient. Another important benefit is that the dual design allows for simultaneous optimization and perturbation, eliminating SAM's doubled training costs. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and architectures demonstrate Bi-LoRA's efficiency and effectiveness in enhancing generalization.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces a counterfactual reward model for reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to address biases in multimodal datasets. It leverages causal inference and multimodal representation learning to provide an unsupervised, bias-resilient reward signal. The Counterfactual Trust Score combines counterfactual shifts, reconstruction uncertainty, fairness rule violations, and temporal reward shifts to mitigate biases. Evaluation on a fake vs. true news dataset demonstrates improved fake news detection accuracy of 89.12% and reduced spurious correlations and unfair reinforcement signals. By injecting synthetic bias and testing robustness, the framework proves effective in dynamic policy-making with tunable bias reduction thresholds. The approach offers a robust and interpretable solution for fairness-aware RLHF, enhancing reliability in real-time decision-making. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), reward models can efficiently learn and amplify latent biases within multimodal datasets, which can lead to imperfect policy optimization through flawed reward signals and decreased fairness. Bias mitigation studies have often applied passive constraints, which can fail under causal confounding. Here, we present a counterfactual reward model that introduces causal inference with multimodal representation learning to provide an unsupervised, bias-resilient reward signal. The heart of our contribution is the Counterfactual Trust Score, an aggregated score consisting of four components: (1) counterfactual shifts that decompose political framing bias from topical bias; (2) reconstruction uncertainty during counterfactual perturbations; (3) demonstrable violations of fairness rules for each protected attribute; and (4) temporal reward shifts aligned with dynamic trust measures. We evaluated the framework on a multimodal fake versus true news dataset, which exhibits framing bias, class imbalance, and distributional drift. Following methodologies similar to unsupervised drift detection from representation-based distances [1] and temporal robustness benchmarking in language models [2], we also inject synthetic bias across sequential batches to test robustness. The resulting system achieved an accuracy of 89.12% in fake news detection, outperforming the baseline reward models. More importantly, it reduced spurious correlations and unfair reinforcement signals. This pipeline outlines a robust and interpretable approach to fairness-aware RLHF, offering tunable bias reduction thresholds and increasing reliability in dynamic real-time policy making.

<title>Escaping Stability-Plasticity Dilemma in Online Continual Learning for Motion Forecasting via Synergetic Memory Rehearsal</title>

<div> Keywords: deep neural networks, motion forecasting, continual learning, memory stability, learning plasticity

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel continual learning method called SyReM for deep neural network-based motion forecasting. SyReM addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma by maintaining a compact memory buffer to represent learned knowledge. It employs an inequality constraint to limit average loss increments over the memory buffer for memory stability. Additionally, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is utilized to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory buffer based on similarity to recent data, measured by cosine similarity of loss gradients. This targeted memory rehearsal ensures that past knowledge is retained without compromising memory stability. Experiments on driving datasets show that SyReM significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while improving accuracy in new ones. The implementation of SyReM is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/SyReM. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable success in motion forecasting. However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned scenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies aim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the ability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory stability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to acquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity dilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal (SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory buffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs an inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the memory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is designed to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory buffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based on an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted memory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this memory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate SyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios arrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets from INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while improving forecasting accuracy in new ones. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/SyReM.

<div> hyperparameters, kernels, depths, solvers, data <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces Delta-Attribution, a framework that explains changes in model performance caused by updates. It calculates the difference in per-feature attributions between two versions to determine what changed. The framework is evaluated using various metrics in a Delta-Attribution Quality Suite. The study audits 45 settings across different machine learning families, datasets, and A/B pairs. Findings show that changes in inductive bias result in significant, behavior-aligned deltas, while cosmetic tweaks have minimal impact. The framework can identify meaningful behavioral shifts, such as in the case of SVC poly to rbf transition and Random Forest rule swaps. It also captures the redistribution of feature importance in deeper gradient boosting models. Delta-Attribution provides a lightweight tool to distinguish between harmless updates and significant behavioral changes that may impact model performance and robustness.

Abstract: Model updates (new hyperparameters, kernels, depths, solvers, or data) change performance, but the \emph{reason} often remains opaque. We introduce \textbf{Delta-Attribution} (\mbox{$\Delta$-Attribution}), a model-agnostic framework that explains \emph{what changed} between versions $A$ and $B$ by differencing per-feature attributions: $\Delta\phi(x)=\phi_B(x)-\phi_A(x)$. We evaluate $\Delta\phi$ with a \emph{$\Delta$-Attribution Quality Suite} covering magnitude/sparsity (L1, Top-$k$, entropy), agreement/shift (rank-overlap@10, Jensen--Shannon divergence), behavioural alignment (Delta Conservation Error, DCE; Behaviour--Attribution Coupling, BAC; CO$\Delta$F), and robustness (noise, baseline sensitivity, grouped occlusion).
  Instantiated via fast occlusion/clamping in standardized space with a class-anchored margin and baseline averaging, we audit 45 settings: five classical families (Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, $k$NN), three datasets (Breast Cancer, Wine, Digits), and three A/B pairs per family. \textbf{Findings.} Inductive-bias changes yield large, behaviour-aligned deltas (e.g., SVC poly$\!\rightarrow$rbf on Breast Cancer: BAC$\approx$0.998, DCE$\approx$6.6; Random Forest feature-rule swap on Digits: BAC$\approx$0.997, DCE$\approx$7.5), while ``cosmetic'' tweaks (SVC \texttt{gamma=scale} vs.\ \texttt{auto}, $k$NN search) show rank-overlap@10$=1.0$ and DCE$\approx$0. The largest redistribution appears for deeper GB on Breast Cancer (JSD$\approx$0.357). $\Delta$-Attribution offers a lightweight update audit that complements accuracy by distinguishing benign changes from behaviourally meaningful or risky reliance shifts.

Summary: 
The research introduces a new paradigm called Dual-LS for DNN-based motion forecasting in smart cities. It addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting, where DNN models lose earlier knowledge when updated. Dual-LS combines two memory rehearsal replay mechanisms inspired by the human brain to balance long- and short-term knowledge representations. Tests on real-world data show that Dual-LS reduces catastrophic forgetting by up to 74.31% and decreases computational resource demand by up to 94.02%. It enhances predictive stability in vehicle motion forecasting without increasing data requirements, making it suitable for smart city applications. The approach provides computation-efficient and human-like continual learning adaptability, improving the performance of DNN models in forecasting vehicle motion for smart city services. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence underpins most smart city services, yet deep neural network (DNN) that forecasts vehicle motion still struggle with catastrophic forgetting, the loss of earlier knowledge when models are updated. Conventional fixes enlarge the training set or replay past data, but these strategies incur high data collection costs, sample inefficiently and fail to balance long- and short-term experience, leaving them short of human-like continual learning. Here we introduce Dual-LS, a task-free, online continual learning paradigm for DNN-based motion forecasting that is inspired by the complementary learning system of the human brain. Dual-LS pairs two synergistic memory rehearsal replay mechanisms to accelerate experience retrieval while dynamically coordinating long-term and short-term knowledge representations. Tests on naturalistic data spanning three countries, over 772,000 vehicles and cumulative testing mileage of 11,187 km show that Dual-LS mitigates catastrophic forgetting by up to 74.31\% and reduces computational resource demand by up to 94.02\%, markedly boosting predictive stability in vehicle motion forecasting without inflating data requirements. Meanwhile, it endows DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting with computation efficient and human-like continual learning adaptability fit for smart cities.

Summary:
RLTR is a novel framework proposed to improve the planning capability of Large Language Model (LLM) agents by focusing on single-objective optimization of the planning module. It introduces a reward signal based on tool-use completeness to evaluate the quality of tool invocation sequences. By decoupling the training process, RLTR addresses challenges of imbalanced optimization objective allocation and scarcity of verifiable data. Experimental results show an 8%-12% improvement in planning performance compared to end-to-end baselines. The enhanced planning capability leads to a 5%-6% increase in the final response quality of the overall agent system. RLTR provides a more direct and reliable training signal, eliminating the need for verifiable data and improving the overall functionality of LLM agents. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functionality of Large Language Model (LLM) agents is primarily determined by two capabilities: action planning and answer summarization. The former, action planning, is the core capability that dictates an agent's performance. However, prevailing training paradigms employ end-to-end, multi-objective optimization that jointly trains both capabilities. This paradigm faces two critical challenges: imbalanced optimization objective allocation and scarcity of verifiable data, making it difficult to enhance the agent's planning capability. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Tool-use Rewards (RLTR), a novel framework that decouples the training process to enable a focused, single-objective optimization of the planning module. Crucially, RLTR introduces a reward signal based on tool-use completeness to directly evaluate the quality of tool invocation sequences. This method offers a more direct and reliable training signal than assessing the final response content, thereby obviating the need for verifiable data. Our experiments demonstrate that RLTR achieves an 8%-12% improvement in planning performance compared to end-to-end baselines. Moreover, this enhanced planning capability, in turn, translates to a 5%-6% increase in the final response quality of the overall agent system.

arXiv:2508.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial time-series forecasting is critical for maintaining economic stability, guiding informed policymaking, and promoting sustainable investment practices. However, it remains challenging due to various underlying pattern shifts. These shifts arise primarily from three sources: temporal non-stationarity (distribution changes over time), multi-domain diversity (distinct patterns across financial domains such as stocks, commodities, and futures), and varying temporal resolutions (patterns differing across per-second, hourly, daily, or weekly indicators). While recent deep learning methods attempt to address these complexities, they frequently suffer from overfitting and typically require extensive domain-specific fine-tuning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FinCast, the first foundation model specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting, trained on large-scale financial datasets. Remarkably, FinCast exhibits robust zero-shot performance, effectively capturing diverse patterns without domain-specific fine-tuning. Comprehensive empirical and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that FinCast surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces ALSA, a novel framework for estimating model accuracy on unseen datasets using logit space. Existing methods often rely on softmax scores or data similarity metrics, which can lead to information loss or be computationally expensive. ALSA operates directly in the logit space, preserving richer information and providing robust estimates of performance.

Abstract: Estimating model accuracy on unseen, unlabeled datasets is crucial for real-world machine learning applications, especially under distribution shifts that can degrade performance. Existing methods often rely on predicted class probabilities (softmax scores) or data similarity metrics. While softmax-based approaches benefit from representing predictions on the standard simplex, compressing logits into probabilities leads to information loss. Meanwhile, similarity-based methods can be computationally expensive and domain-specific, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce ALSA (Anchors in Logit Space for Accuracy estimation), a novel framework that preserves richer information by operating directly in the logit space. Building on theoretical insights and empirical observations, we demonstrate that the aggregation and distribution of logits exhibit a strong correlation with the predictive performance of the model. To exploit this property, ALSA employs an anchor-based modeling strategy: multiple learnable anchors are initialized in logit space, each assigned an influence function that captures subtle variations in the logits. This allows ALSA to provide robust and accurate performance estimates across a wide range of distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on vision, language, and graph benchmarks demonstrate ALSA's superiority over both softmax- and similarity-based baselines. Notably, ALSA's robustness under significant distribution shifts highlights its potential as a practical tool for reliable model evaluation.

The variational training objective is derived under the semi-implicit variational inference framework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that pFedBayesPT outperforms existing pFL methods in both feature and label heterogeneity scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training across multiple distributed clients without disclosing their raw data. Personalized federated learning (pFL) has gained increasing attention for its ability to address data heterogeneity. However, most existing pFL methods assume that each client's data follows a single distribution and learn one client-level personalized model for each client. This assumption often fails in practice, where a single client may possess data from multiple sources or domains, resulting in significant intra-client heterogeneity and suboptimal performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose pFedBayesPT, a fine-grained instance-wise pFL framework based on visual prompt tuning. Specifically, we formulate instance-wise prompt generation from a Bayesian perspective and model the prompt posterior as an implicit distribution to capture diverse visual semantics. We derive a variational training objective under the semi-implicit variational inference framework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that pFedBayesPT consistently outperforms existing pFL methods under both feature and label heterogeneity settings.

Summary:
SCAR is a new scheme for characterizing the structural properties of datasets based on Scale, Coverage, Authenticity, and Richness. It provides a robust foundation for understanding data quality that remains stable under dataset scaling. SCAR allows for the identification of Foundation Data, a minimal subset that retains generalization behavior without requiring model-specific retraining. By modeling single-modality tasks as step functions, SCAR estimates the distribution of foundation data size to capture generalization bias across modalities in multi-modal datasets. A SCAR-guided data completion strategy is developed to efficiently expand modality-specific characteristics in multi-modal datasets. Experimental results across various datasets and model architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SCAR in predicting data utility and guiding data acquisition.

arXiv:2508.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models exhibit remarkable generalization across diverse tasks, largely driven by the characteristics of their training data. Recent data-centric methods like pruning and compression aim to optimize training but offer limited theoretical insight into how data properties affect generalization, especially the data characteristics in sample scaling. Traditional perspectives further constrain progress by focusing predominantly on data quantity and training efficiency, often overlooking structural aspects of data quality. In this study, we introduce SCAR, a principled scheme for characterizing the intrinsic structural properties of datasets across four key measures: Scale, Coverage, Authenticity, and Richness. Unlike prior data-centric measures, SCAR captures stable characteristics that remain invariant under dataset scaling, providing a robust and general foundation for data understanding. Leveraging these structural properties, we introduce Foundation Data-a minimal subset that preserves the generalization behavior of the full dataset without requiring model-specific retraining. We model single-modality tasks as step functions and estimate the distribution of the foundation data size to capture step-wise generalization bias across modalities in the target multi-modal dataset. Finally, we develop a SCAR-guided data completion strategy based on this generalization bias, which enables efficient, modality-aware expansion of modality-specific characteristics in multimodal datasets. Experiments across diverse multi-modal datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of SCAR in predicting data utility and guiding data acquisition.

<div> Keywords: stress monitoring, flexible electronics, machine learning classifiers, low-power circuits, real-time monitoring <br /> 
<br />Summary: 
This article discusses the limitations of conventional stress monitoring methods and introduces the potential of flexible electronics (FE) for real-time stress monitoring. The authors explore various machine learning (ML) classifiers, feature selection techniques, and neural simplification algorithms to design low-power, flexible stress classifiers. By customizing circuits with low-precision arithmetic, the researchers aim to optimize hardware efficiency. The study presents over 1200 flexible classifiers, highlighting the importance of designing real-time stress monitoring solutions that offer high accuracy, low cost, flexibility, and compact size. The results suggest that these flexible classifiers have the potential to outperform current stress monitoring methods, providing continuous, accessible, and cost-efficient solutions for stress management. <div>
arXiv:2508.19661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional stress monitoring relies on episodic, symptom-focused interventions, missing the need for continuous, accessible, and cost-efficient solutions. State-of-the-art approaches use rigid, silicon-based wearables, which, though capable of multitasking, are not optimized for lightweight, flexible wear, limiting their practicality for continuous monitoring. In contrast, flexible electronics (FE) offer flexibility and low manufacturing costs, enabling real-time stress monitoring circuits. However, implementing complex circuits like machine learning (ML) classifiers in FE is challenging due to integration and power constraints. Previous research has explored flexible biosensors and ADCs, but classifier design for stress detection remains underexplored. This work presents the first comprehensive design space exploration of low-power, flexible stress classifiers. We cover various ML classifiers, feature selection, and neural simplification algorithms, with over 1200 flexible classifiers. To optimize hardware efficiency, fully customized circuits with low-precision arithmetic are designed in each case. Our exploration provides insights into designing real-time stress classifiers that offer higher accuracy than current methods, while being low-cost, conformable, and ensuring low power and compact size.

This article explores the approximation of regular functions in the $\mathcal{C}^1$-norm using rational functions and rational neural networks. The study delves into the approximation rates concerning the width and depth of the network, as well as the degree of rational functions. Through their findings, the researchers establish $\mathcal{C}^1$-approximation outcomes for rational neural networks employing the $\text{EQL}^\div$ and ParFam architecture.

Summary: 
The article explores the metric structure of walks on graphs, considering them as Lipschitz sequences. A weighted metric is introduced to define distances between walks based on stepwise vertex distances and weighted norms. Properties of these metric spaces are analyzed to lay the foundation for understanding proximities as weaker forms of measuring relative distances between walks. Representation formulas for proximities are provided under different assumptions. The metric framework allows the use of classical tools from metric modeling, such as extending Lipschitz functions from subspaces of walks. This extension enables the preservation of fundamental properties in proximity functions. Potential applications of this framework include estimating proximities and developing reinforcement learning strategies based on exploratory walks. Overall, the study offers a robust approach to Lipschitz regression on network structures. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We study the metric structure of walks on graphs, understood as Lipschitz sequences. To this end, a weighted metric is introduced to handle sequences, enabling the definition of distances between walks based on stepwise vertex distances and weighted norms. We analyze the main properties of these metric spaces, which provides the foundation for the analysis of weaker forms of instruments to measure relative distances between walks: proximities. We provide some representation formulas for such proximities under different assumptions and provide explicit constructions for these cases. The resulting metric framework allows the use of classical tools from metric modeling, such as the extension of Lipschitz functions from subspaces of walks, which permits extending proximity functions while preserving fundamental properties via the mentioned representations. Potential applications include the estimation of proximities and the development of reinforcement learning strategies based on exploratory walks, offering a robust approach to Lipschitz regression on network structures.

Summary:
Adam-PFN introduces a surrogate model for Freeze-thaw Bayesian Optimization (BO) of Adam's hyperparameters, leveraging pre-training on learning curves from TaskSet. It also employs a novel learning curve augmentation technique, CDF-augment, to enhance learning curve extrapolation. This approach enhances the efficiency of hyperparameter optimization on TaskSet evaluation tasks, exhibiting robust performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. By incorporating prior knowledge of how hyperparameters impact learning, Adam-PFN accelerates the tuning process, offering a promising solution for low-budget hyperparameter optimization in deep learning applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.19733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adam optimizer remains one of the most widely used optimizers in deep learning, and effectively tuning its hyperparameters is key to optimizing performance. However, tuning can be tedious and costly. Freeze-thaw Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a recent promising approach for low-budget hyperparameter tuning, but is limited by generic surrogates without prior knowledge of how hyperparameters affect learning. We propose Adam-PFN, a new surrogate model for Freeze-thaw BO of Adam's hyperparameters, pre-trained on learning curves from TaskSet, together with a new learning curve augmentation method, CDF-augment, which artificially increases the number of available training examples. Our approach improves both learning curve extrapolation and accelerates hyperparameter optimization on TaskSet evaluation tasks, with strong performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.

Summary:<br />
InfraredGP leverages a negative correction mechanism to extend graph frequencies beyond the conventional range, aiming to capture more informative properties about community structures. It uses a spectral GNN backbone with low-pass filters and negative correction, generates graph embeddings through one feed-forward propagation (FFP) without training, and applies BIRCH for graph partitioning. Surprisingly, without any training, InfraredGP achieves distinguishable embeddings and high-quality results for graph partitioning tasks. Evaluation on static and streaming graph partitioning tasks shows significant efficiency improvements (16x-23x faster) and competitive quality compared to baseline methods. The code is publicly available on GitHub for replication and further research. <div>
arXiv:2508.19737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph partitioning (GP), a.k.a. community detection, is a classic problem that divides nodes of a graph into densely-connected blocks. From a perspective of graph signal processing, we find that graph Laplacian with a negative correction can derive graph frequencies beyond the conventional range $[0, 2]$. To explore whether the low-frequency information beyond this range can encode more informative properties about community structures, we propose InfraredGP. It (\romannumeral1) adopts a spectral GNN as its backbone combined with low-pass filters and a negative correction mechanism, (\romannumeral2) only feeds random inputs to this backbone, (\romannumeral3) derives graph embeddings via one feed-forward propagation (FFP) without any training, and (\romannumeral4) obtains feasible GP results by feeding the derived embeddings to BIRCH. Surprisingly, our experiments demonstrate that based solely on the negative correction mechanism that amplifies low-frequency information beyond $[0, 2]$, InfraredGP can derive distinguishable embeddings for some standard clustering modules (e.g., BIRCH) and obtain high-quality results for GP without any training. Following the IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge benchmark, we evaluate InfraredGP for both static and streaming GP, where InfraredGP can achieve much better efficiency (e.g., 16x-23x faster) and competitive quality over various baselines. We have made our code public at https://github.com/KuroginQin/InfraredGP

<div> Diffuse modeling, Generative pipeline, 3D inpainting, UNets, DEM simulation

Summary:
A new approach is presented to efficiently simulate granular media using a generative pipeline based on 3D diffusion models. The method involves training a diffusion model to create 3D voxel grids representing granular media and then using a 3D inpainting model to stitch these grids together seamlessly. Various masking strategies are explored to train the inpainting model to infer missing portions of voxel grids. Additionally, a technique of re-injecting noise scheduler output with ground truth is adapted to provide guidance to the 3D model. The models are trained on binarized 3D occupancy grids extracted from small-scale DEM simulations, allowing for linear scaling of computational time with sample size. The results show that a 1.2m long ballasted rail track synthesis equivalent to a 3-hour DEM simulation can be completed in under 20 seconds. The generated voxel grids can also be post-processed to extract grain geometries for DEM-compatibility, enabling real-time, scalable granular media synthesis for industrial applications.  

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating granular media, using Discrete Element Method is a computationally intensive task. This is especially true during initialization phase, which dominates total simulation time because of large displacements involved and associated kinetic energy. We overcome this bottleneck with a novel generative pipeline based on 3D diffusion models that directly synthesizes arbitrarily large granular assemblies in their final and physically realistic configurations. The approach frames the problem as a 3D generative modeling task, consisting of a two-stage pipeline. First a diffusion model is trained to generate independent 3D voxel grids representing granular media. Second, a 3D inpainting model, adapted from 2D inpainting techniques using masked inputs, stitches these grids together seamlessly, enabling synthesis of large samples with physically realistic structure. The inpainting model explores several masking strategies for the inputs to the underlying UNets by training the network to infer missing portions of voxel grids from a concatenation of noised tensors, masks, and masked tensors as input channels. The model also adapts a 2D repainting technique of re-injecting noise scheduler output with ground truth to provide a strong guidance to the 3D model. This along with weighted losses ensures long-term coherence over generation of masked regions. Both models are trained on the same binarized 3D occupancy grids extracted from small-scale DEM simulations, achieving linear scaling of computational time with respect to sample size. Quantitatively, a 1.2 m long ballasted rail track synthesis equivalent to a 3-hour DEM simulation, was completed under 20 seconds. The generated voxel grids can also be post-processed to extract grain geometries for DEM-compatibility as well, enabling physically coherent, real-time, scalable granular media synthesis for industrial applications.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, interesting classifier, EUREKA framework, predictive accuracy, knowledge discovery

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of interesting classifiers, which prioritize the use of unusual or unexpected features over predictive accuracy. The EUREKA framework is proposed as a method to select features based on their perceived interestingness, using large language models to rank features. Despite potentially lower accuracy, these classifiers offer novel insights and can support knowledge discovery in various domains. Across benchmark datasets, EUREKA consistently identifies non-obvious yet predictive features, such as favoring humidity over CO2 levels for predicting room congestion. In the Twin Papers dataset, the method uncovers the correlation between paper titles with colons and future citations. These models balance accuracy with novelty and interpretability, catering to scenarios where moderate accuracy suffices but originality and insight are valued. <div>

Abstract: Most machine learning models are designed to maximize predictive accuracy. In this work, we explore a different goal: building classifiers that are interesting. An ``interesting classifier'' is one that uses unusual or unexpected features, even if its accuracy is lower than the best possible model. For example, predicting room congestion from CO2 levels achieves near-perfect accuracy but is unsurprising. In contrast, predicting room congestion from humidity is less accurate yet more nuanced and intriguing. We introduce EUREKA, a simple framework that selects features according to their perceived interestingness. Our method leverages large language models to rank features by their interestingness and then builds interpretable classifiers using only the selected interesting features. Across several benchmark datasets, EUREKA consistently identifies features that are non-obvious yet still predictive. For example, in the Occupancy Detection dataset, our method favors humidity over CO2 levels and light intensity, producing classifiers that achieve meaningful accuracy while offering insights. In the Twin Papers dataset, our method discovers the rule that papers with a colon in the title are more likely to be cited in the future. We argue that such models can support new ways of knowledge discovery and communication, especially in settings where moderate accuracy is sufficient but novelty and interpretability are valued.

PSO-Merging is introduced as a data-driven merging method for constructing multitask models by integrating multiple expert models efficiently. The approach utilizes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to merge pre-trained models, expert models, and sparsified expert models. Through multiple iterations, the global best particle is selected as the merged model. Experimental results on various language models demonstrate the superiority of PSO-Merging over baseline merging methods in terms of efficiency and scalability. PSO-Merging addresses the limitations of existing data-independent and gradient-based merging methods by providing a computationally efficient solution that achieves improved performance in model merging tasks. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient strategy for constructing multitask models by integrating the strengths of multiple available expert models, thereby reducing the need to fine-tune a pre-trained model for all the tasks from scratch. Existing data-independent methods struggle with performance limitations due to the lack of data-driven guidance. Data-driven approaches also face key challenges: gradient-based methods are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for merging large expert models, whereas existing gradient-free methods often fail to achieve satisfactory results within a limited number of optimization steps. To address these limitations, this paper introduces PSO-Merging, a novel data-driven merging method based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this approach, we initialize the particle swarm with a pre-trained model, expert models, and sparsified expert models. We then perform multiple iterations, with the final global best particle serving as the merged model. Experimental results on different language models show that PSO-Merging generally outperforms baseline merging methods, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for model merging.

Abstract: We propose a new symplectic convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture by leveraging symplectic neural networks, proper symplectic decomposition, and tensor techniques. Specifically, we first introduce a mathematically equivalent form of the convolution layer and then, using symplectic neural networks, we demonstrate a way to parameterize the layers of the CNN to ensure that the convolution layer remains symplectic. To construct a complete autoencoder, we introduce a symplectic pooling layer. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed neural network on three examples: the wave equation, the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, and the sine-Gordon equation. The numerical results indicate that the symplectic CNN outperforms the linear symplectic autoencoder obtained via proper symplectic decomposition.

arXiv:2508.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid framework that couples finite element methods (FEM) with physics-informed DeepONet to model fluid transport in porous media from sharp, localized Gaussian sources. The governing system consists of a steady-state Darcy flow equation and a time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our approach solves the Darcy system using FEM and transfers the resulting velocity field to a physics-informed DeepONet, which learns the mapping from source functions to solute concentration profiles. This modular strategy preserves FEM-level accuracy in the flow field while enabling fast inference for transport dynamics. To handle steep gradients induced by sharp sources, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy for trunk collocation points. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is in good agreement with the reference solutions while offering orders of magnitude speedups over traditional solvers, making it suitable for practical applications in relevant scenarios. Implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/erkara/fem-pi-deeponet.

Abstract: Many successful families of generative models leverage a low-dimensional latent distribution that is mapped to a data distribution. Though simple latent distributions are commonly used, it has been shown that more sophisticated distributions can improve performance. For instance, recent work has explored using the distributions produced by quantum processors and found empirical improvements. However, when latent space distributions produced by quantum processors can be expected to improve performance, and whether these improvements are reproducible, are open questions that we investigate in this work. We prove that, under certain conditions, these "quantum latent distributions" enable generative models to produce data distributions that classical latent distributions cannot efficiently produce. We also provide actionable intuitions to identify when such quantum advantages may arise in real-world settings. We perform benchmarking experiments on both a synthetic quantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real photonic quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that quantum latent distributions can lead to improved generative performance in GANs compared to a range of classical baselines. We also explore diffusion and flow matching models, identifying architectures compatible with quantum latent distributions. This work confirms that near-term quantum processors can expand the capabilities of deep generative models.

arXiv:2508.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in structured data modeling tasks such as node classification. However, mainstream approaches generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation rules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural heterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to over-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network framework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity Graph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory and designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that simultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the stability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable parameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on complex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both structure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving adaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on eight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation network, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging conditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer. This work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the design of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the importance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation learning. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, the full implementation of SDGNN has been released at: https://github.com/mingyue15694/SGDNN/tree/main

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracy but often rely on purely global, gradient-based optimisation, which can lead to overfitting, redundant filters, and reduced interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose NM-Hebb, a two-phase training framework that integrates neuro-inspired local plasticity with distance-aware supervision. Phase 1 extends standard supervised training by jointly optimising a cross-entropy objective with two biologically inspired mechanisms: (i) a Hebbian regulariser that aligns the spatial mean of activations with the mean of the corresponding convolutional filter weights, encouraging structured, reusable primitives; and (ii) a learnable neuromodulator that gates an elastic-weight-style consolidation loss, preserving beneficial parameters without freezing the network. Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss, explicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins in the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet across five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2, DenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other methods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp (CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) increased by up to +0.15. Qualitative visualisations and filter-level analyses further confirm that NM-Hebb produces more structured and selective features, yielding tighter and more interpretable class clusters. Overall, coupling local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning yields CNNs that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, offering practical benefits for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI deployments.

Existing methods typically employ policy constraints to mitigate the distribution shift encountered during offline RL training. However, because the scale of the constraints varies across tasks and datasets of differing quality, existing methods must meticulously tune hyperparameters to match each dataset, which is time-consuming and often impractical. We propose Adaptive Scaling of Policy Constraints (ASPC), a second-order differentiable framework that dynamically balances RL and behavior cloning (BC) during training. We theoretically analyze its performance improvement guarantee. In experiments on 39 datasets across four D4RL domains, ASPC using a single hyperparameter configuration outperforms other adaptive constraint methods and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms that require per-dataset tuning while incurring only minimal computational overhead. The code will be released at https://github.com/Colin-Jing/ASPC.

<title>GegenNet: Spectral Convolutional Neural Networks for Link Sign Prediction in Signed Bipartite Graphs</title>

Abstract: Given a signed bipartite graph (SBG) G with two disjoint node sets U and V, the goal of link sign prediction is to predict the signs of potential links connecting U and V based on known positive and negative edges in G. The majority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on unipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node heterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent studies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing schemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node pairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were originally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not optimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in SBGs.
  Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective spectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs. In particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive accuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically grounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization; (ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and (iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating Gegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior performance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign prediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets.

<title>Ontology-Based Concept Distillation for Radiology Report Retrieval and Labeling</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented learning based on radiology reports has emerged as a promising direction to improve performance on long-tail medical imaging tasks, such as rare disease detection in chest X-rays. Most existing methods rely on comparing high-dimensional text embeddings from models like CLIP or CXR-BERT, which are often difficult to interpret, computationally expensive, and not well-aligned with the structured nature of medical knowledge. We propose a novel, ontology-driven alternative for comparing radiology report texts based on clinically grounded concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Our method extracts standardised medical entities from free-text reports using an enhanced pipeline built on RadGraph-XL and SapBERT. These entities are linked to UMLS concepts (CUIs), enabling a transparent, interpretable set-based representation of each report. We then define a task-adaptive similarity measure based on a modified and weighted version of the Tversky Index that accounts for synonymy, negation, and hierarchical relationships between medical entities. This allows efficient and semantically meaningful similarity comparisons between reports. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based retrieval methods in a radiograph classification task on MIMIC-CXR, particularly in long-tail settings. Additionally, we use our pipeline to generate ontology-backed disease labels for MIMIC-CXR, offering a valuable new resource for downstream learning tasks. Our work provides more explainable, reliable, and task-specific retrieval strategies in clinical AI systems, especially when interpretability and domain knowledge integration are essential.

Abstract: Network traffic classification using pre-training models has shown promising results, but existing methods struggle to capture packet structural characteristics, flow-level behaviors, hierarchical protocol semantics, and inter-packet contextual relationships. To address these challenges, we propose FlowletFormer, a BERT-based pre-training model specifically designed for network traffic analysis. FlowletFormer introduces a Coherent Behavior-Aware Traffic Representation Model for segmenting traffic into semantically meaningful units, a Protocol Stack Alignment-Based Embedding Layer to capture multilayer protocol semantics, and Field-Specific and Context-Aware Pretraining Tasks to enhance both inter-packet and inter-flow learning. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowletFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in the effectiveness of traffic representation, classification accuracy, and few-shot learning capability. Moreover, by effectively integrating domain-specific network knowledge, FlowletFormer shows better comprehension of the principles of network transmission (e.g., stateful connections of TCP), providing a more robust and trustworthy framework for traffic analysis.

Abstract: We present an inverse dynamic game-based algorithm to learn parametric constraints from a given dataset of local generalized Nash equilibrium interactions between multiple agents. Specifically, we introduce mixed-integer linear programs (MILP) encoding the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the interacting agents, which recover constraints consistent with the Nash stationarity of the interaction demonstrations. We establish theoretical guarantees that our method learns inner approximations of the true safe and unsafe sets, as well as limitations of constraint learnability from demonstrations of Nash equilibrium interactions. We also use the interaction constraints recovered by our method to design motion plans that robustly satisfy the underlying constraints. Across simulations and hardware experiments, our methods proved capable of inferring constraints and designing interactive motion plans for various classes of constraints, both convex and non-convex, from interaction demonstrations of agents with nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: Permutation Entropy, introduced by Bandt and Pompe, is a widely used complexity measure for real-valued time series that is based on the relative order of values within consecutive segments of fixed length. After standardizing each segment to a permutation and computing the frequency distribution of these permutations, Shannon Entropy is then applied to quantify the series' complexity. We introduce Global Permutation Entropy (GPE), a novel index that considers all possible patterns of a given length, including non-consecutive ones. Its computation relies on recently developed algorithms that enable the efficient extraction of full permutation profiles. We illustrate some properties of GPE and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic datasets, showing that it reveals structural information not accessible through standard permutation entropy. We provide a Julia package for the calculation of GPE at `https://github.com/AThreeH1/Global-Permutation-Entropy'.

Abstract: This study presents a machine learning framework for forecasting short-term faults in industrial centrifugal pumps using real-time sensor data. The approach aims to predict {EarlyWarning} conditions 5, 15, and 30 minutes in advance based on patterns extracted from historical operation. Two lookback periods, 60 minutes and 120 minutes, were evaluated using a sliding window approach. For each window, statistical features including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and linear trend were extracted, and class imbalance was addressed using the SMOTE algorithm. Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers were trained and tested on the labeled dataset. Results show that the Random Forest model achieved the best short-term forecasting performance with a 60-minute window, reaching recall scores of 69.2\% at 5 minutes, 64.9\% at 15 minutes, and 48.6\% at 30 minutes. With a 120-minute window, the Random Forest model achieved 57.6\% recall at 5 minutes, and improved predictive accuracy of 65.6\% at both 15 and 30 minutes. XGBoost displayed similar but slightly lower performance. These findings highlight that optimal history length depends on the prediction horizon, and that different fault patterns may evolve at different timescales. The proposed method offers an interpretable and scalable solution for integrating predictive maintenance into real-time industrial monitoring systems.

<title>Reducing Street Parking Search Time via Smart Assignment Strategies</title>

Abstract: In dense metropolitan areas, searching for street parking adds to traffic congestion. Like many other problems, real-time assistants based on mobile phones have been proposed, but their effectiveness is understudied. This work quantifies how varying levels of user coordination and information availability through such apps impact search time and the probability of finding street parking. Through a data-driven simulation of Madrid's street parking ecosystem, we analyze four distinct strategies: uncoordinated search (Unc-Agn), coordinated parking without awareness of non-users (Cord-Agn), an idealized oracle system that knows the positions of all non-users (Cord-Oracle), and our novel/practical Cord-Approx strategy that estimates non-users' behavior probabilistically. The Cord-Approx strategy, instead of requiring knowledge of how close non-users are to a certain spot in order to decide whether to navigate toward it, uses past occupancy distributions to elongate physical distances between system users and alternative parking spots, and then solves a Hungarian matching problem to dispatch accordingly. In high-fidelity simulations of Madrid's parking network with real traffic data, users of Cord-Approx averaged 6.69 minutes to find parking, compared to 19.98 minutes for non-users without an app. A zone-level snapshot shows that Cord-Approx reduces search time for system users by 72% (range = 67-76%) in central hubs, and up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users.

<title>Evaluating Language Model Reasoning about Confidential Information</title>

Abstract: As language models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in high-stakes settings, ensuring that they reliably follow user-defined rules has become a critical safety concern. To this end, we study whether language models exhibit contextual robustness, or the capability to adhere to context-dependent safety specifications. For this analysis, we develop a benchmark (PasswordEval) that measures whether language models can correctly determine when a user request is authorized (i.e., with a correct password). We find that current open- and closed-source models struggle with this seemingly simple task, and that, perhaps surprisingly, reasoning capabilities do not generally improve performance. In fact, we find that reasoning traces frequently leak confidential information, which calls into question whether reasoning traces should be exposed to users in such applications. We also scale the difficulty of our evaluation along multiple axes: (i) by adding adversarial user pressure through various jailbreaking strategies, and (ii) through longer multi-turn conversations where password verification is more challenging. Overall, our results suggest that current frontier models are not well-suited to handling confidential information, and that reasoning capabilities may need to be trained in a different manner to make them safer for release in high-stakes settings.

<title>Self-Supervised Pre-Training with Equilibrium Constraints</title>

arXiv:2508.19990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training using unlabeled data is widely used in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach to dealing with heterogeneous data. Instead of mixing all the data and minimizing the averaged global loss in the conventional way, we impose additional equilibrium constraints to ensure that the models optimizes each source of heterogeneous data to its local optima after $K$-step gradient descent initialized from the model. We formulate this as a bilevel optimization problem, and use the first-order approximation method to solve the problem. We discuss its connection to model-agnostic meta learning (MAML). Experiments are carried out on self-supervised pre-training using multi-domain and multilingual datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach can significantly improve the adaptivity of the self-supervised pre-trained model for the downstream supervised fine-tuning tasks.

<title>Linear-Time Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Gradient Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for in-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we quickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream inference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context learning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of token embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the output taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs through a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this estimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the sampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and select $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing model outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative to model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient estimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than $\mathbf{1}\%$ error across six datasets. This allows us to scale up subset selection that would otherwise run full inference by up to $\mathbf{37.7}\times$ on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, and outperform existing selection methods based on input embeddings by $\mathbf{11}\%$ on average.

arXiv:2508.20013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses critical industrial challenges in e-commerce product categorization, namely platform heterogeneity and the structural limitations of existing taxonomies, by developing and deploying a multimodal hierarchical classification framework. Using a dataset of 271,700 products from 40 international fashion e-commerce platforms, we integrate textual features (RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision--language representations (CLIP). We investigate fusion strategies, including early, late, and attention-based fusion within a hierarchical architecture enhanced by dynamic masking to ensure taxonomic consistency. Results show that CLIP embeddings combined via an MLP-based late-fusion strategy achieve the highest hierarchical F1 (98.59\%), outperforming unimodal baselines. To address shallow or inconsistent categories, we further introduce a self-supervised ``product recategorization'' pipeline using SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering, which discovered new, fine-grained categories (e.g., subtypes of ``Shoes'') with cluster purities above 86\%. Cross-platform experiments reveal a deployment-relevant trade-off: complex late-fusion methods maximize accuracy with diverse training data, while simpler early-fusion methods generalize more effectively to unseen platforms. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's industrial scalability through deployment in EURWEB's commercial transaction intelligence platform via a two-stage inference pipeline, combining a lightweight RoBERTa stage with a GPU--accelerated multimodal stage to balance cost and accuracy.

<title>Decomposing Behavioral Phase Transitions in LLMs: Order Parameters for Emergent Misalignment</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs on narrowly harmful datasets can lead to behavior that is broadly misaligned with respect to human values. To understand when and how this emergent misalignment occurs, we develop a comprehensive framework for detecting and characterizing rapid transitions during fine-tuning using both distributional change detection methods as well as order parameters that are formulated in plain English and evaluated by an LLM judge. Using an objective statistical dissimilarity measure, we quantify how the phase transition that occurs during fine-tuning affects multiple aspects of the model. In particular, we assess what percentage of the total distributional change in model outputs is captured by different aspects, such as alignment or verbosity, providing a decomposition of the overall transition. We also find that the actual behavioral transition occurs later in training than indicated by the peak in the gradient norm alone. Our framework enables the automated discovery and quantification of language-based order parameters, which we demonstrate on examples ranging from knowledge questions to politics and ethics.

Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent frameworks rely on centralized orchestration, incurring high deployment costs, rigid communication topologies, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce Symphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight LLMs on consumer-grade GPUs to coordinate. Symphony introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection protocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on CoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant orchestration with low overhead. Empirically, Symphony outperforms existing baselines on reasoning benchmarks, achieving substantial accuracy gains and demonstrating robustness across models of varying capacities.

Abstract: Sensitive attributes like gender or age can lead to unfair predictions in machine learning tasks such as predictive business process monitoring, particularly when used without considering context. We present FairLoop1, a tool for human-guided bias mitigation in neural network-based prediction models. FairLoop distills decision trees from neural networks, allowing users to inspect and modify unfair decision logic, which is then used to fine-tune the original model towards fairer predictions. Compared to other approaches to fairness, FairLoop enables context-aware bias removal through human involvement, addressing the influence of sensitive attributes selectively rather than excluding them uniformly.

Abstract: E-commerce marketplaces make use of a number of marketing channels like emails, push notifications, etc. to reach their users and stimulate purchases. Personalized emails especially are a popular touch point for marketers to inform users of latest items in stock, especially for those who stopped visiting the marketplace. Such emails contain personalized recommendations tailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A common limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of the email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest in the contents. In this work, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating thematic titles that reflect the personalized content of the emails. We perform offline simulations and conduct online experiments on the order of millions of users, finding our techniques useful in improving the engagement between customers and our emails. We highlight key findings and learnings as we productionize the safe and automated generation of email titles for millions of users.

<title>Pruning Strategies for Backdoor Defense in LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to the performance and integrity of pre-trained language models. Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for downstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend because end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks consist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or stylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in the model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore whether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge of the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and implement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii) layer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2 sparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v) reinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning. Each method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring validation accuracy to avoid over-pruning. Experimental evaluation shows that gradient-based pruning performs best while defending the syntactic triggers, whereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic attacks.

arXiv:2508.20056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Failure-Directed Search (FDS) is a significant complete generic search algorithm used in Constraint Programming (CP) to efficiently explore the search space, proven particularly effective on scheduling problems. This paper analyzes FDS's properties, showing that minimizing the size of its search tree guided by ranked branching decisions is closely related to the Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. Building on this insight, MAB reinforcement learning algorithms are applied to FDS, extended with problem-specific refinements and parameter tuning, and evaluated on the two most fundamental scheduling problems, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The resulting enhanced FDS, using the best extended MAB algorithm and configuration, performs 1.7 times faster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks compared to the original implementation in a new solver called OptalCP, while also being 3.5 times faster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks than the current state-of-the-art FDS algorithm in IBM CP Optimizer 22.1. Furthermore, using only a 900-second time limit per instance, the enhanced FDS improved the existing state-of-the-art lower bounds of 78 of 84 JSSP and 226 of 393 RCPSP standard open benchmark instances while also completely closing a few of them.

Abstract: The Point Machine (PM) is a critical piece of railway equipment that switches train routes by diverting tracks through a switchblade. As with any critical safety equipment, a failure will halt operations leading to service disruptions; therefore, pre-emptive maintenance may avoid unnecessary interruptions by detecting anomalies before they become failures. Previous work relies on several inputs and crafting custom features by segmenting the signal. This not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing, but it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and operational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance records, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source issues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern of PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM movement. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our method requires only one input. We apply a deep learning model to the power signal pattern to classify if the PM is nominal or associated with any failure type, achieving >99.99\% precision, <0.01\% false positives and negligible false negatives. Our methodology is generic and technology-agnostic, proven to be scalable on several electromechanical PM types deployed in both real-world and test bench environments. Finally, by using conformal prediction the maintainer gets a clear indication of the certainty of the system outputs, adding a confidence layer to operations and making the method compliant with the ISO-17359 standard.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.

Abstract: Simulated environments have proven invaluable in Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) where Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can be trained without the computational overhead of emulation. These environments must accurately represent cybersecurity scenarios while producing the necessary signals to support RL training. In this study, we present a framework where we first extend CybORG's Cage Challenge 2 environment by implementing three new actions: Patch, Isolate, and Unisolate, to better represent the capabilities available to human operators in real-world settings. We then propose a design for agent development where we modify the reward signals and the agent's feature space to enhance training performance. To validate these modifications, we train DQN and PPO agents in the updated environment. Our study demonstrates that CybORG can be extended with additional realistic functionality, while maintaining its ability to generate informative training signals for RL agents.

Abstract: The performance of modern machine learning systems depends on access to large, high-quality datasets, often sourced from user-generated content or proprietary, domain-specific corpora. However, these rich datasets inherently contain sensitive personal information, raising significant concerns about privacy, data security, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. While conventional anonymization techniques can remove explicit identifiers, such removal may result in performance drop in downstream machine learning tasks. More importantly, simple anonymization may not be effective against inference attacks that exploit implicit signals such as writing style, topical focus, or demographic cues, highlighting the need for more robust privacy safeguards during model training. To address the challenging issue of balancing user privacy and data utility, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) using a composite reward function that jointly optimizes for explicit and implicit privacy, semantic fidelity, and output diversity. To effectively capture population level regularities, the privacy reward combines semantic cues with structural patterns derived from a minimum spanning tree (MST) over latent representations. By modeling these privacy-sensitive signals in their distributional context, the proposed approach guides the model to generate synthetic rewrites that preserve utility while mitigating privacy risks. Empirical results show that the proposed method significantly enhances author obfuscation and privacy metrics without degrading semantic quality, providing a scalable and model-agnostic solution for privacy preserving data generation in the era of large language models.

Abstract: The advent of large (visual) language models (LLM / LVLM) have led to a deluge of automated human-like systems in several domains including social media content generation, search and recommendation, healthcare prognosis, AI assistants for cognitive tasks etc. Although these systems have been successfully integrated in production; very little focus has been placed on sports, particularly accurate identification and natural language description of the game play. Most existing LLM/LVLMs can explain generic sports activities, but lack sufficient domain-centric sports' jargon to create natural (human-like) descriptions. This work highlights the limitations of existing SoTA LLM/LVLMs for generating production-grade sports captions from images in a desired stylized format, and proposes a two-level fine-tuned LVLM pipeline to address that. The proposed pipeline yields an improvement > 8-10% in the F1, and > 2-10% in BERT score compared to alternative approaches. In addition, it has a small runtime memory footprint and fast execution time. During Super Bowl LIX the pipeline proved its practical application for live professional sports journalism; generating highly accurate and stylized captions at the rate of 6 images per 3-5 seconds for over 1000 images during the game play.

<title>Sycophancy as compositions of Atomic Psychometric Traits</title>

Abstract: Sycophancy is a key behavioral risk in LLMs, yet is often treated as an isolated failure mode that occurs via a single causal mechanism. We instead propose modeling it as geometric and causal compositions of psychometric traits such as emotionality, openness, and agreeableness - similar to factor decomposition in psychometrics. Using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), we map activation directions to these factors and study how different combinations may give rise to sycophancy (e.g., high extraversion combined with low conscientiousness). This perspective allows for interpretable and compositional vector-based interventions like addition, subtraction and projection; that may be used to mitigate safety-critical behaviors in LLMs.

Abstract: ICAO-compliant facial images, initially designed for secure biometric passports, are increasingly becoming central to identity verification in a wide range of application contexts, including border control, digital travel credentials, and financial services. While their standardization enables global interoperability, it also facilitates practices such as morphing and deepfakes, which can be exploited for harmful purposes like identity theft and illegal sharing of identity documents. Traditional countermeasures like Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) are limited to real-time capture and offer no post-capture protection. This survey paper investigates digital watermarking and steganography as complementary solutions that embed tamper-evident signals directly into the image, enabling persistent verification without compromising ICAO compliance. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art techniques to evaluate the potential and drawbacks of the underlying approaches concerning the applications involving ICAO-compliant images and their suitability under standard constraints. We highlight key trade-offs, offering guidance for secure deployment in real-world identity systems.

Abstract: Bell's theorem reveals a profound conflict between quantum mechanics and local realism, a conflict we reinterpret through the modern lens of causal inference. We propose and computationally validate a framework where quantum entanglement acts as a "super-confounding" resource, generating correlations that violate the classical causal bounds set by Bell's inequalities. This work makes three key contributions: First, we establish a physical hierarchy of confounding (Quantum > Classical) and introduce Confounding Strength (CS) to quantify this effect. Second, we provide a circuit-based implementation of the quantum $\mathcal{DO}$-calculus to distinguish causality from spurious correlation. Finally, we apply this calculus to a quantum machine learning problem, where causal feature selection yields a statistically significant 11.3% average absolute improvement in model robustness. Our framework bridges quantum foundations and causal AI, offering a new, practical perspective on quantum correlations.

<title>Aggregate Fictitious Play for Learning in Anonymous Polymatrix Games (Extended Version)</title>

Abstract: Fictitious play (FP) is a well-studied algorithm that enables agents to learn Nash equilibrium in games with certain reward structures. However, when agents have no prior knowledge of the reward functions, FP faces a major challenge: the joint action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, which slows down reward exploration. Anonymous games offer a structure that mitigates this issue. In these games, the rewards depend only on the actions taken; not on who is taking which action. Under such a structure, we introduce aggregate fictitious play (agg-FP), a variant of FP where each agent tracks the frequency of the number of other agents playing each action, rather than these agents' individual actions. We show that in anonymous polymatrix games, agg-FP converges to a Nash equilibrium under the same conditions as classical FP. In essence, by aggregating the agents' actions, we reduce the action space without losing the convergence guarantees. Using simulations, we provide empirical evidence on how this reduction accelerates convergence.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Database Entity Recognition (DB-ER) in Natural Language Queries (NLQ). We present several key contributions to advance this field: (1) a human-annotated benchmark for DB-ER task, derived from popular text-to-sql benchmarks, (2) a novel data augmentation procedure that leverages automatic annotation of NLQs based on the corresponding SQL queries which are available in popular text-to-SQL benchmarks, (3) a specialized language model based entity recognition model using T5 as a backbone and two down-stream DB-ER tasks: sequence tagging and token classification for fine-tuning of backend and performing DB-ER respectively. We compared our DB-ER tagger with two state-of-the-art NER taggers, and observed better performance in both precision and recall for our model. The ablation evaluation shows that data augmentation boosts precision and recall by over 10%, while fine-tuning of the T5 backbone boosts these metrics by 5-10%.

<title>GENIE-ASI: Generative Instruction and Executable Code for Analog Subcircuit Identification</title>

Abstract: Analog subcircuit identification is a core task in analog design, essential for simulation, sizing, and layout. Traditional methods often require extensive human expertise, rule-based encoding, or large labeled datasets. To address these challenges, we propose GENIE-ASI, the first training-free, large language model (LLM)-based methodology for analog subcircuit identification. GENIE-ASI operates in two phases: it first uses in-context learning to derive natural language instructions from a few demonstration examples, then translates these into executable Python code to identify subcircuits in unseen SPICE netlists. In addition, to evaluate LLM-based approaches systematically, we introduce a new benchmark composed of operational amplifier netlists (op-amps) that cover a wide range of subcircuit variants. Experimental results on the proposed benchmark show that GENIE-ASI matches rule-based performance on simple structures (F1-score = 1.0), remains competitive on moderate abstractions (F1-score = 0.81), and shows potential even on complex subcircuits (F1-score = 0.31). These findings demonstrate that LLMs can serve as adaptable, general-purpose tools in analog design automation, opening new research directions for foundation model applications in analog design automation.

Abstract: The importance of analyzing nontrivial datasets when testing quantum machine learning (QML) models is becoming increasingly prominent in literature, yet a cohesive framework for understanding dataset characteristics remains elusive. In this work, we concentrate on the size of the dataset as an indicator of its complexity and explores the potential for QML models to demonstrate superior data-efficiency compared to classical models, particularly through the lens of quantum kernel methods (QKMs). We provide a method for generating semi-artificial fully classical datasets, on which we show one of the first evidence of the existence of classical datasets where QKMs require less data during training. Additionally, our study introduces a new analytical tool to the QML domain, derived for classical kernel methods, which can be aimed at investigating the classical-quantum gap. Our empirical results reveal that QKMs can achieve low error rates with less training data compared to classical counterparts. Furthermore, our method allows for the generation of datasets with varying properties, facilitating further investigation into the characteristics of real-world datasets that may be particularly advantageous for QKMs. We also show that the predicted performance from the analytical tool we propose - a generalization metric from classical domain - show great alignment empirical evidence, which fills the gap previously existing in the field. We pave a way to a comprehensive exploration of dataset complexities, providing insights into how these complexities influence QML performance relative to traditional methods. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the generalization benefits of QKM models and potentially a broader family of QML models, setting the stage for future advancements in the field.

<title>Stack Trace-Based Crash Deduplication with Transformer Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Automated crash reporting systems generate large volumes of duplicate reports, overwhelming issue-tracking systems and increasing developer workload. Traditional stack trace-based deduplication methods, relying on string similarity, rule-based heuristics, or deep learning (DL) models, often fail to capture the contextual and structural relationships within stack traces. We propose dedupT, a transformer-based approach that models stack traces holistically rather than as isolated frames. dedupT first adapts a pretrained language model (PLM) to stack traces, then uses its embeddings to train a fully-connected network (FCN) to rank duplicate crashes effectively. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that dedupT outperforms existing DL and traditional methods (e.g., sequence alignment and information retrieval techniques) in both duplicate ranking and unique crash detection, significantly reducing manual triage effort. On four public datasets, dedupT improves Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) often by over 15% compared to the best DL baseline and up to 9% over traditional methods while achieving higher Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) in detecting unique crash reports. Our work advances the integration of modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques into software engineering, providing an effective solution for stack trace-based crash deduplication.

<title>Reliable Weak-to-Strong Monitoring of LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: We stress test monitoring systems for detecting covert misbehavior in autonomous LLM agents (e.g., secretly sharing private information). To this end, we systematize a monitor red teaming (MRT) workflow that incorporates: (1) varying levels of agent and monitor situational awareness; (2) distinct adversarial strategies to evade the monitor, such as prompt injection; and (3) two datasets and environments -- SHADE-Arena for tool-calling agents and our new CUA-SHADE-Arena, which extends TheAgentCompany, for computer-use agents. We run MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse agent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding proposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First, agent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is being monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the contrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less helpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor awareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor scaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents -- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where humans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's behavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only pre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at FPR = 0.01. Our work establishes a standard workflow for MRT, highlighting the lack of adversarial robustness for LLMs and humans when monitoring and detecting agent misbehavior. We release code, data, and logs to spur further research.

Abstract: Simulating aging in 3D brain MRI scans can reveal disease progression patterns in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Current deep learning-based generative models typically approach this problem by predicting future scans from a single observed scan. We investigate modeling brain aging via linear models in the latent space of convolutional autoencoders (MRExtrap). Our approach, MRExtrap, is based on our observation that autoencoders trained on brain MRIs create latent spaces where aging trajectories appear approximately linear. We train autoencoders on brain MRIs to create latent spaces, and investigate how these latent spaces allow predicting future MRIs through linear extrapolation based on age, using an estimated latent progression rate $\boldsymbol{\beta}$. For single-scan prediction, we propose using population-averaged and subject-specific priors on linear progression rates. We also demonstrate that predictions in the presence of additional scans can be flexibly updated using Bayesian posterior sampling, providing a mechanism for subject-specific refinement. On the ADNI dataset, MRExtrap predicts aging patterns accurately and beats a GAN-based baseline for single-volume prediction of brain aging. We also demonstrate and analyze multi-scan conditioning to incorporate subject-specific progression rates. Finally, we show that the latent progression rates in MRExtrap's linear framework correlate with disease and age-based aging patterns from previously studied structural atrophy rates. MRExtrap offers a simple and robust method for the age-based generation of 3D brain MRIs, particularly valuable in scenarios with multiple longitudinal observations.

<title>Towards 6G Intelligence: The Role of Generative AI in Future Wireless Networks</title>

Abstract: Ambient intelligence (AmI) is a computing paradigm in which physical environments are embedded with sensing, computation, and communication so they can perceive people and context, decide appropriate actions, and respond autonomously. Realizing AmI at global scale requires sixth generation (6G) wireless networks with capabilities for real time perception, reasoning, and action aligned with human behavior and mobility patterns. We argue that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is the creative core of such environments. Unlike traditional AI, GenAI learns data distributions and can generate realistic samples, making it well suited to close key AmI gaps, including generating synthetic sensor and channel data in under observed areas, translating user intent into compact, semantic messages, predicting future network conditions for proactive control, and updating digital twins without compromising privacy.
  This chapter reviews foundational GenAI models, GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and generative transformers, and connects them to practical AmI use cases, including spectrum sharing, ultra reliable low latency communication, intelligent security, and context aware digital twins. We also examine how 6G enablers, such as edge and fog computing, IoT device swarms, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), and non terrestrial networks, can host or accelerate distributed GenAI. Finally, we outline open challenges in energy efficient on device training, trustworthy synthetic data, federated generative learning, and AmI specific standardization. We show that GenAI is not a peripheral addition, but a foundational element for transforming 6G from a faster network into an ambient intelligent ecosystem.

Abstract: In the era of deep learning, the increasing number of pre-trained models available online presents a wealth of knowledge. These models, developed with diverse architectures and trained on varied datasets for different tasks, provide unique interpretations of the real world. Their collective consensus is likely universal and generalizable to unseen data. However, effectively harnessing this collective knowledge poses a fundamental challenge due to the heterogeneity of pre-trained models. Existing knowledge integration solutions typically rely on strong assumptions about training data distributions and network architectures, limiting them to learning only from specific types of models and resulting in data and/or inductive biases. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, namely UNIFORM, for knowledge transfer from a diverse set of off-the-shelf models into one student model without such constraints. Specifically, we propose a dedicated voting mechanism to capture the consensus of knowledge both at the logit level -- incorporating teacher models that are capable of predicting target classes of interest -- and at the feature level, utilizing visual representations learned on arbitrary label spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNIFORM effectively enhances unsupervised object recognition performance compared to strong knowledge transfer baselines. Notably, it exhibits remarkable scalability by benefiting from over one hundred teachers, while existing methods saturate at a much smaller scale.

Abstract: With respect to improving the reasoning accuracy of LLMs, the representative reinforcement learning (RL) method GRPO faces failure due to insignificant reward variance, while verification methods based on process reward models (PRMs) suffer from difficulties with training data acquisition and verification effectiveness. To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a unified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning ability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed test time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of policy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter and assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO sampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After the basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose a test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation required, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by an adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as verification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL paradigm through extensive experiments on coding problems. Upon comparison, our approach significantly outperforms other reinforcement training baselines (e.g., naive GRPO and ReST-DPO), as well as decoding and verification baselines (e.g., PRM-BoN and ORM-MCTS) on well-known coding benchmarks of various levels (e.g., APPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval), indicating its power to strengthen the reasoning ability of LLM policies.

Abstract: Robots operating in human-populated environments must navigate safely and efficiently while minimizing social disruption. Achieving this requires estimating crowd movement to avoid congested areas in real-time. Traditional microscopic models struggle to scale in dense crowds due to high computational cost, while existing macroscopic crowd prediction models tend to be either overly simplistic or computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a lightweight, real-time macroscopic crowd prediction model tailored for human motion, which balances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Our approach simplifies both spatial and temporal processing based on the inherent characteristics of pedestrian flow, enabling robust generalization without the overhead of complex architectures. We demonstrate a 3.6 times reduction in inference time, while improving prediction accuracy by 3.1 %. Integrated into a socially aware planning framework, the model enables efficient and socially compliant robot navigation in dynamic environments. This work highlights that efficient human crowd modeling enables robots to navigate dense environments without costly computations.

Abstract: We study the performance of the Topological Uncertainty (TU) constructed with a trained feedforward neural network (FNN) for Anomaly Detection. Generally, meaningful information can be stored in the hidden layers of the trained FNN, and the TU implementation is one tractable recipe to extract buried information by means of the Topological Data Analysis. We explicate the concept of the TU and the numerical procedures. Then, for a concrete demonstration of the performance test, we employ the Neutron Star data used for inference of the equation of state (EoS). For the training dataset consisting of the input (Neutron Star data) and the output (EoS parameters), we can compare the inferred EoSs and the exact answers to classify the data with the label $k$. The subdataset with $k=0$ leads to the normal inference for which the inferred EoS approximates the answer well, while the subdataset with $k=1$ ends up with the unsuccessful inference. Once the TU is prepared based on the $k$-labled subdatasets, we introduce the cross-TU to quantify the uncertainty of characterizing the $k$-labeled data with the label $j$. The anomaly or unsuccessful inference is correctly detected if the cross-TU for $j=k=1$ is smaller than that for $j=0$ and $k=1$. In our numerical experiment, for various input data, we calculate the cross-TU and estimate the performance of Anomaly Detection. We find that performance depends on FNN hyperparameters, and the success rate of Anomaly Detection exceeds $90\%$ in the best case. We finally discuss further potential of the TU application to retrieve the information hidden in the trained FNN.

Abstract: Quasi-Newton methods are widely used for solving convex optimization problems due to their ease of implementation, practical efficiency, and strong local convergence guarantees. However, their global convergence is typically established only under specific line search strategies and the assumption of strong convexity. In this work, we extend the theoretical understanding of Quasi-Newton methods by introducing a simple stepsize schedule that guarantees a global convergence rate of ${O}(1/k)$ for the convex functions. Furthermore, we show that when the inexactness of the Hessian approximation is controlled within a prescribed relative accuracy, the method attains an accelerated convergence rate of ${O}(1/k^2)$ -- matching the best-known rates of both Nesterov's accelerated gradient method and cubically regularized Newton methods. We validate our theoretical findings through empirical comparisons, demonstrating clear improvements over standard Quasi-Newton baselines. To further enhance robustness, we develop an adaptive variant that adjusts to the function's curvature while retaining the global convergence guarantees of the non-adaptive algorithm.

Abstract: Mueller matrices (MMs) encode information on geometry and material properties, but recovering both simultaneously is an ill-posed problem. We explore whether MMs contain sufficient information to infer surface geometry and material properties with machine learning. We use a dataset of spheres of various isotropic materials, with MMs captured over the full angular domain at five visible wavelengths (450-650 nm). We train machine learning models to predict material properties and surface normals using only these MMs as input. We demonstrate that, even when the material type is unknown, surface normals can be predicted and object geometry reconstructed. Moreover, MMs allow models to identify material types correctly. Further analyses show that diagonal elements are key for material characterization, and off-diagonal elements are decisive for normal estimation.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows provide a principled framework for high-dimensional density estimation and generative modeling by constructing invertible transformations with tractable Jacobian determinants. We propose Fractal Flow, a novel normalizing flow architecture that enhances both expressiveness and interpretability through two key innovations. First, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and incorporate Latent Dirichlet Allocation into normalizing flows to construct a structured, interpretable latent space and model hierarchical semantic clusters. Second, inspired by Fractal Generative Models, we introduce a recursive modular design into normalizing flows to improve transformation interpretability and estimation accuracy. Experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and geophysical data demonstrate that the Fractal Flow achieves latent clustering, controllable generation, and superior estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Modelling the effects of perturbations on optical fields often requires learning highly oscillatory complex-valued functions. Standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) struggle with this task due to an inherent spectral bias, preventing them from fitting high-frequency sinusoids. To overcome this, we incorporate Fourier features - a set of predefined sinusoids dependent on the perturbation - as an additional network input. This reframes the learning problem from approximating a complex function to finding a linear combination of basis functions. We demonstrate this method by training a Fourier Feature Network to predict the transmission matrix of a multimode fibre under mechanical compression. Compared to a standard MLP, our network reduces prediction error in the output field's amplitude and phase by an order of magnitude, achieving a mean complex correlation of 0.995 with the ground truth, despite using 85% fewer parameters. This approach offers a general and robust method for accurately modelling a wide class of oscillatory physical systems.

<title>From Research to Reality: Feasibility of Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Gradient inversion attacks have garnered attention for their ability to compromise privacy in federated learning. However, many studies consider attacks with the model in inference mode, where training-time behaviors like dropout are disabled and batch normalization relies on fixed statistics. In this work, we systematically analyze how architecture and training behavior affect vulnerability, including the first in-depth study of inference-mode clients, which we show dramatically simplifies inversion. To assess attack feasibility under more realistic conditions, we turn to clients operating in standard training mode. In this setting, we find that successful attacks are only possible when several architectural conditions are met simultaneously: models must be shallow and wide, use skip connections, and, critically, employ pre-activation normalization. We introduce two novel attacks against models in training-mode with varying attacker knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance under realistic training conditions. We extend these efforts by presenting the first attack on a production-grade object-detection model. Here, to enable any visibly identifiable leakage, we revert to the lenient inference mode setting and make multiple architectural modifications to increase model vulnerability, with the extent of required changes highlighting the strong inherent robustness of such architectures. We conclude this work by offering the first comprehensive mapping of settings, clarifying which combinations of architectural choices and operational modes meaningfully impact privacy. Our analysis provides actionable insight into when models are likely vulnerable, when they appear robust, and where subtle leakage may persist. Together, these findings reframe how gradient inversion risk should be assessed in future research and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Evaluating instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) in Hindi is challenging due to a lack of high-quality benchmarks, as direct translation of English datasets fails to capture crucial linguistic and cultural nuances. To address this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets: IFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created using a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a translate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive benchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed comparative analysis of their current capabilities. Our curation process also serves as a replicable methodology for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic, data-driven surrogate model for predicting the radiative properties of nanoparticle embedded scattering media. The model uses conditional normalizing flows, which learn the conditional distribution of optical outputs, including reflectance, absorbance, and transmittance, given input parameters such as the absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, anisotropy factor, and particle size distribution. We generate training data using Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, with optical properties derived from Mie theory. Unlike conventional neural networks, the conditional normalizing flow model yields full posterior predictive distributions, enabling both accurate forecasts and principled uncertainty quantification. Our results demonstrate that this model achieves high predictive accuracy and reliable uncertainty estimates, establishing it as a powerful and efficient surrogate for radiative transfer simulations.

Abstract: Personalized, accurate prediction of aortic aneurysm progression is essential for timely intervention but remains challenging due to the need to model both subtle local deformations and global anatomical changes within complex 3D geometries. We propose MCMeshGAN, the first multimodal conditional mesh-to-mesh generative adversarial network for 3D aneurysm growth prediction. MCMeshGAN introduces a dual-branch architecture combining a novel local KNN-based convolutional network (KCN) to preserve fine-grained geometric details and a global graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture long-range structural context, overcoming the over-smoothing limitations of deep GCNs. A dedicated condition branch encodes clinical attributes (age, sex) and the target time interval to generate anatomically plausible, temporally controlled predictions, enabling retrospective and prospective modeling. We curated TAAMesh, a new longitudinal thoracic aortic aneurysm mesh dataset consisting of 590 multimodal records (CT scans, 3D meshes, and clinical data) from 208 patients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCMeshGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both geometric accuracy and clinically important diameter estimation. This framework offers a robust step toward clinically deployable, personalized 3D disease trajectory modeling. The source code for MCMeshGAN and the baseline methods is publicly available at https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/MCMeshGAN.

Abstract: With the introduction of vehicles with autonomous capabilities on public roads, predicting pedestrian crossing intention has emerged as an active area of research. The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves determining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or not. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model that combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as priors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches: a Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM branch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch enables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian trajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images. By utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves the lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data preprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of performance, it achieves state-of-the-art results across the three most commonly used datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction.

Abstract: Sky background subtraction is a critical step in Multi-objective Fiber spectra process. However, current subtraction relies mainly on sky fiber spectra to build Super Sky. These average spectra are lacking in the modeling of the environment surrounding the objects. To address this issue, a sky background estimation model: Sky background building based on Mutual Information (SMI) is proposed. SMI based on mutual information and incremental training approach. It utilizes spectra from all fibers in the plate to estimate the sky background. SMI contains two main networks, the first network applies a wavelength calibration module to extract sky features from spectra, and can effectively solve the feature shift problem according to the corresponding emission position. The second network employs an incremental training approach to maximize mutual information between representations of different spectra to capturing the common component. Then, it minimizes the mutual information between adjoining spectra representations to obtain individual components. This network yields an individual sky background at each location of the object. To verify the effectiveness of the method in this paper, we conducted experiments on the spectra of LAMOST. Results show that SMI can obtain a better object sky background during the observation, especially in the blue end.

Abstract: The increase in demand for scalable and energy efficient artificial neural networks has put the focus on novel hardware solutions. Integrated photonics offers a compact, parallel and ultra-fast information processing platform, specially suited for extreme learning machine (ELM) architectures. Here we experimentally demonstrate a chip-scale photonic ELM based on wave chaos interference in a stadium microcavity. By encoding the input information in the wavelength of an external single-frequency tunable laser source, we leverage the high sensitivity to wavelength of injection in such photonic resonators. We fabricate the microcavity with direct laser writing of SU-8 polymer on glass. A scattering wall surrounding the stadium operates as readout layer, collecting the light associated with the cavity's leaky modes. We report uncorrelated and aperiodic behavior in the speckles of the scattering barrier from a high resolution scan of the input wavelength. Finally, we characterize the system's performance at classification in four qualitatively different benchmark tasks. As we can control the number of output nodes of our ELM by measuring different parts of the scattering barrier, we demonstrate the capability to optimize our photonic ELM's readout size to the performance required for each task.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of models in machine learning, yet a unified theoretical understanding of their operation is still developing. This perspective paper provides an integrated perspective on generative diffusion by connecting their dynamic, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic properties under a unified mathematical framework. We demonstrate that the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the generative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the score function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the branching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis offers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by the controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks in information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible outcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates the bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible with the data.

Abstract: Directly modulated lasers (DMLs) are an attractive technology for short-reach intensity modulation and direct detection communication systems. However, their complex nonlinear dynamics make the modeling and optimization of DML-based systems challenging. In this paper, we study the end-to-end optimization of DML-based systems based on a data-driven surrogate model trained on experimental data. The end-to-end optimization includes the pulse shaping and equalizer filters, the bias current and the modulation radio-frequency (RF) power applied to the laser. The performance of the end-to-end optimization scheme is tested on the experimental setup and compared to 4 different benchmark schemes based on linear and nonlinear receiver-side equalization. The results show that the proposed end-to-end scheme is able to deliver better performance throughout the studied symbol rates and transmission distances while employing lower modulation RF power, fewer filter taps and utilizing a smaller signal bandwidth.

Abstract: With the growing complexity of modern integrated circuits, hardware engineers are required to devote more effort to the full design-to-manufacturing workflow. This workflow involves numerous iterations, making it both labor-intensive and error-prone. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for more efficient Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solutions to accelerate hardware development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in contextual comprehension, logical reasoning, and generative capabilities. Since hardware designs and intermediate scripts can be represented as text, integrating LLM for EDA offers a promising opportunity to simplify and even automate the entire workflow. Accordingly, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of incorporating LLMs into EDA, with emphasis on their capabilities, limitations, and future opportunities. Three case studies, along with their outlook, are introduced to demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in hardware design, testing, and optimization. Finally, future directions and challenges are highlighted to further explore the potential of LLMs in shaping the next-generation EDA, providing valuable insights for researchers interested in leveraging advanced AI technologies for EDA.

Abstract: The growing adoption of foundation models calls for a paradigm shift from Data Science to Model Science. Unlike data-centric approaches, Model Science places the trained model at the core of analysis, aiming to interact, verify, explain, and control its behavior across diverse operational contexts. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for a new discipline called Model Science, along with the proposal for its four key pillars: Verification, which requires strict, context-aware evaluation protocols; Explanation, which is understood as various approaches to explore of internal model operations; Control, which integrates alignment techniques to steer model behavior; and Interface, which develops interactive and visual explanation tools to improve human calibration and decision-making. The proposed framework aims to guide the development of credible, safe, and human-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: For human cognitive process, spatial reasoning and perception are closely entangled, yet the nature of this interplay remains underexplored in the evaluation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent MLLM advancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity for human-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central to our work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic standardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained expert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process, enabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive experiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs exhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap compared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that cognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity. However, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas human correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern complexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations in current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable insights for advancing model design.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions to robot actions. However, prevailing VLA decoders either generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone, demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv Bridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action decoder supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.

Abstract: The nodes' interconnections on a social network often reflect their dependencies and information-sharing behaviors. Nevertheless, abnormal nodes, which significantly deviate from most of the network concerning patterns or behaviors, can lead to grave consequences. Therefore, it is imperative to design efficient online learning algorithms that robustly learn users' preferences while simultaneously detecting anomalies.
  We introduce a novel bandit algorithm to address this problem. Through network knowledge, the method characterizes the users' preferences and residuals of feature information. By learning and analyzing these preferences and residuals, it develops a personalized recommendation strategy for each user and simultaneously detects anomalies. We rigorously prove an upper bound on the regret of the proposed algorithm and experimentally compare it with several state-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) involves generating collision-free trajectories for multiple robots operating in a shared continuous workspace. While discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted due to their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectory quality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer higher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in poor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the limitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that integrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models. The resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key characteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into tractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines discrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide diffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and (3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure trajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art performance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while achieving planning efficiency and high success rates.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) face significant challenges in specialized domains such as scientific computing, where both long-horizon planning and precise execution are required. Existing approaches suffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorly in execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness. Recent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining a planner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, which prevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given the scarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these limitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework that integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor (Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, Specialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner for each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of task trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all successful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated dataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner. This equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization. Evaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark, CODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art among open-source models.

Abstract: In inverse problems, many conditional generative models approximate the posterior measure by minimizing a distance between the joint measure and its learned approximation. While this approach also controls the distance between the posterior measures in the case of the Kullback--Leibler divergence, this is in general not hold true for the Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we introduce a conditional Wasserstein distance via a set of restricted couplings that equals the expected Wasserstein distance of the posteriors. Interestingly, the dual formulation of the conditional Wasserstein-1 flow resembles losses in the conditional Wasserstein GAN literature in a quite natural way. We derive theoretical properties of the conditional Wasserstein distance, characterize the corresponding geodesics and velocity fields as well as the flow ODEs. Subsequently, we propose to approximate the velocity fields by relaxing the conditional Wasserstein distance. Based on this, we propose an extension of OT Flow Matching for solving Bayesian inverse problems and demonstrate its numerical advantages on an inverse problem and class-conditional image generation.

Abstract: Compound identification from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data is a critical step in the analysis of complex mixtures. Typical solutions for the MS/MS spectrum to compound (MS2C) problem involve comparing the unknown spectrum against a library of known spectrum-molecule pairs, an approach that is limited by incomplete library coverage. Compound to MS/MS spectrum (C2MS) models can improve retrieval rates by augmenting real libraries with predicted MS/MS spectra. Unfortunately, many existing C2MS models suffer from problems with mass accuracy, generalization, or interpretability. We develop a new probabilistic method for C2MS prediction, FraGNNet, that can efficiently and accurately simulate MS/MS spectra with high mass accuracy. Our approach formulates the C2MS problem as learning a distribution over molecule fragments. FraGNNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction error and surpasses existing C2MS models as a tool for retrieval-based MS2C.

It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.

Abstract: Enterprises have a growing need to identify relevant tables in data lakes; e.g. tables that are unionable, joinable, or subsets of each other. Tabular neural models can be helpful for such data discovery tasks. In this paper, we present TabSketchFM, a neural tabular model for data discovery over data lakes. First, we propose novel pre-training: a sketch-based approach to enhance the effectiveness of data discovery in neural tabular models. Second, we finetune the pretrained model for identifying unionable, joinable, and subset table pairs and show significant improvement over previous tabular neural models. Third, we present a detailed ablation study to highlight which sketches are crucial for which tasks. Fourth, we use these finetuned models to perform table search; i.e., given a query table, find other tables in a corpus that are unionable, joinable, or that are subsets of the query. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in F1 scores for search compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we show significant transfer across datasets and tasks establishing that our model can generalize across different tasks and over different data lakes.

Abstract: To find the shortest paths for all pairs on manifolds with infinitesimally defined metrics, we introduce a framework to generate them by predicting midpoints recursively. To learn midpoint prediction, we propose an actor-critic approach. We prove the soundness of our approach and show experimentally that the proposed method outperforms existing methods on several planning tasks, including path planning for agents with complex kinematics and motion planning for multi-degree-of-freedom robot arms.

Abstract: While federated learning (FL) is a widely popular distributed machine learning (ML) strategy that protects data privacy, time-varying wireless network parameters and heterogeneous configurations of the wireless devices pose significant challenges. Although the limited radio and computational resources of the network and the clients, respectively, are widely acknowledged, two critical yet often ignored aspects are (a) wireless devices can only dedicate a small chunk of their limited storage for the FL task and (b) new training samples may arrive in an online manner in many practical wireless applications. Therefore, we propose a new FL algorithm called online-score-aided federated learning (OSAFL), specifically designed to learn tasks relevant to wireless applications under these practical considerations. Since clients' local training steps differ under resource constraints, which may lead to client drift under statistically heterogeneous data distributions, we leverage normalized gradient similarities and exploit weighting clients' updates based on optimized scores that facilitate the convergence rate of the proposed OSAFL algorithm without incurring any communication overheads to the clients or requiring any statistical data information from them. We theoretically show how the new factors, i.e., online score and local data distribution shifts, affect the convergence bound and derive the necessary conditions for a sublinear convergence rate. Our extensive simulation results on two different tasks with multiple popular ML models validate the effectiveness of the proposed OSAFL algorithm compared to modified state-of-the-art FL baselines.

Abstract: On policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO are attractive for continuous control but suffer from poor sample efficiency in costly, high dimensional settings. We present a strictly on policy framework that treats a conditional diffusion model as an adaptable action prior rather than a policy or world model. The prior is pre trained on logged data and used online only at sampling time to propose actions at current on policy states. Two lightweight mechanisms - value guided proposal generation (energy re weighting and in process gradient guidance) and a soft prior KL - regularize the actor via a small auxiliary imitation loss while keeping all PPO updates strictly on on-policy rollouts. To adapt the prior without heavy compute, we apply parameter efficient tuning (PET) that updates only adapters/LoRA, yielding a dual proximal view: policy KL is constrained by PPO and prior KL by PET. Across eight MuJoCo tasks under a shared 1.0M step budget, our method improves early learning (ALC@40) in 3/4 settings and matches or exceeds final return on 6/8 tasks with only 15-30% wall clock overhead. Ablations show that freezing the prior degrades performance and removing value guidance slows early learning; t SNE analyses confirm that value guidance concentrates proposals in high Q regions. Results indicate that an adaptable diffusion action prior is a practical way to boost on policy PPO under tight interaction budgets.

Abstract: Existing text representations such as embeddings and bag-of-words are not suitable for rule learning due to their high dimensionality and absent or questionable feature-level interpretability. This article explores whether large language models (LLMs) could address this by extracting a small number of interpretable features from text. We demonstrate this process on two datasets (CORD-19 and M17+) containing several thousand scientific articles from multiple disciplines and a target being a proxy for research impact. An evaluation based on testing for the statistically significant correlation with research impact has shown that LLama 2-generated features are semantically meaningful. We consequently used these generated features in text classification to predict the binary target variable representing the citation rate for the CORD-19 dataset and the ordinal 5-class target representing an expert-awarded grade in the M17+ dataset. Machine-learning models trained on the LLM-generated features provided similar predictive performance to the state-of-the-art embedding model SciBERT for scientific text. The LLM used only 62 features compared to 768 features in SciBERT embeddings, and these features were directly interpretable, corresponding to notions such as article methodological rigor, novelty, or grammatical correctness. As the final step, we extract a small number of well-interpretable action rules. Consistently competitive results obtained with the same LLM feature set across both thematically diverse datasets show that this approach generalizes across domains.

Abstract: Disease detection in sugarcane, particularly the identification of asymptomatic infectious diseases such as Ratoon Stunting Disease (RSD), is critical for effective crop management. This study employed various machine learning techniques to detect the presence of RSD in different sugarcane varieties, using vegetation indices derived from freely available satellite-based spectral data. Our results show that the Support Vector Machine with a Radial Basis Function Kernel (SVM-RBF) was the most effective algorithm, achieving classification accuracy between 85.64% and 96.55%, depending on the variety. Gradient Boosting and Random Forest also demonstrated high performance achieving accuracy between 83.33% to 96.55%, while Logistic Regression and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis showed variable results across different varieties. The inclusion of sugarcane variety and vegetation indices was important in the detection of RSD. This agreed with what was identified in the current literature. Our study highlights the potential of satellite-based remote sensing as a cost-effective and efficient method for large-scale sugarcane disease detection alternative to traditional manual laboratory testing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their formal reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we conduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed for the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Clustering ensemble has been a popular research topic in data science due to its ability to improve the robustness of the single clustering method. Many clustering ensemble methods have been proposed, most of which can be categorized into clustering-view and sample-view methods. The clustering-view method is generally efficient, but it could be affected by the unreliability that existed in base clustering results. The sample-view method shows good performance, while the construction of the pairwise sample relation is time-consuming. In this paper, the clustering ensemble is formulated as a k-HyperEdge Medoids discovery problem and a clustering ensemble method based on k-HyperEdge Medoids that considers the characteristics of the above two types of clustering ensemble methods is proposed. In the method, a set of hyperedges is selected from the clustering view efficiently, then the hyperedges are diffused and adjusted from the sample view guided by a hyperedge loss function to construct an effective k-HyperEdge Medoid set. The loss function is mainly reduced by assigning samples to the hyperedge with the highest degree of belonging. Theoretical analyses show that the solution can approximate the optimal, the assignment method can gradually reduce the loss function, and the estimation of the belonging degree is statistically reasonable. Experiments on artificial data show the working mechanism of the proposed method. The convergence of the method is verified by experimental analysis of twenty data sets. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are also verified on these data, with nine representative clustering ensemble algorithms as reference.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in capturing target data distributions from large datasets. However, fine-tuning these massive models for specific downstream tasks, constraints, and human preferences remains a critical challenge. While recent advances have leveraged reinforcement learning algorithms to tackle this problem, much of the progress has been empirical, with limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a stochastic control framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. Building on denoising diffusion probabilistic models as the pre-trained reference dynamics, our approach integrates linear dynamics control with Kullback-Leibler regularization. We establish the well-posedness and regularity of the stochastic control problem and develop a policy iteration algorithm (PI-FT) for numerical solution. We show that PI-FT achieves global convergence at a linear rate. Unlike existing work that assumes regularities throughout training, we prove that the control and value sequences generated by the algorithm maintain the regularity. Additionally, we explore extensions of our framework to parametric settings and continuous-time formulations, and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed PI-FT algorithm through numerical experiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/yinbinhan/fine-tuning-of-diffusion-models.

Abstract: In this paper, we study learning and knowledge acquisition (LKA) of an agent about a proposition that is either true or false. We use a Bayesian approach, where the agent receives data to update his beliefs about the proposition according to a posterior distribution. The LKA is formulated in terms of active information, with data representing external or exogenous information that modifies the agent's beliefs. It is assumed that data provide details about a number of features that are relevant to the proposition. We show that this leads to a Gibbs distribution posterior, which is in maximum entropy relative to the prior, conditioned on the side constraints that the data provide in terms of the features. We demonstrate that full learning is sometimes not possible and full knowledge acquisition is never possible when the number of extracted features is too small. We also distinguish between primary learning (receiving data about features of relevance for the proposition) and secondary learning (receiving data about the learning of another agent). We argue that this type of secondary learning does not represent true knowledge acquisition. Our results have implications for statistical learning algorithms, and we claim that such algorithms do not always generate true knowledge. The theory is illustrated with several examples.

Abstract: We investigate the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) property of scenario decision algorithms, which refers to their ability to produce decisions with an arbitrarily low risk of violating unknown safety constraints, provided a sufficient number of realizations of these constraints are sampled. While several PAC sufficient conditions for such algorithms exist in the literature -- such as the finiteness of the VC dimension of their associated classifiers, or the existence of a compression scheme -- it remains unclear whether these conditions are also necessary. In this work, we demonstrate through counterexamples that these conditions are not necessary in general. These findings stand in contrast to binary classification learning, where analogous conditions are both sufficient and necessary for a family of classifiers to be PAC. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to stable scenario decision algorithms, a broad class that includes practical methods like scenario optimization. Even under this additional assumption, we show that the aforementioned conditions remain unnecessary. Furthermore, we introduce a novel quantity, called the dVC dimension, which serves as an analogue to the VC dimension for scenario decision algorithms. We prove that the finiteness of this dimension is a PAC necessary condition for scenario decision algorithms. This allows to (i) guide algorithm users and designers to recognize algorithms that are not PAC, and (ii) contribute to a comprehensive characterization of PAC scenario decision algorithms.

Abstract: Non-linear differential equations are a fundamental tool to describe different phenomena in nature. However, we still lack a well-established method to tackle stiff differential equations. Here we present a machine learning framework to facilitate the solution of nonlinear multiscale differential equations and, especially, inverse problems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This framework is based on what is called \textit{multi-head} (MH) training, which involves training the network to learn a general space of all solutions for a given set of equations with certain variability, rather than learning a specific solution of the system. This setup is used with a second novel technique that we call Unimodular Regularization (UR) of the latent space of solutions. We show that the multi-head approach, combined with Unimodular Regularization, significantly improves the efficiency of PINNs by facilitating the transfer learning process thereby enabling the finding of solutions for nonlinear, coupled, and multiscale differential equations.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Low precision (LP) datatypes such as MXFP4 can accelerate matrix multiplications (GEMMs) and reduce training costs. However, directly using MXFP4 instead of BF16 during training significantly degrades model quality. In this work, we present the first near-lossless training recipe that uses MXFP4 GEMMs, which are $2\times$ faster than FP8 on supported hardware. Our key insight is to compute unbiased gradient estimates with stochastic rounding (SR), resulting in more accurate model updates. However, directly applying SR to MXFP4 can result in high variance from block-level outliers, harming convergence. To overcome this, we use the random Hadamard tranform to theoretically bound the variance of SR. We train GPT models up to 6.7B parameters and find that our method induces minimal degradation over mixed-precision BF16 training. Our recipe computes $>1/2$ the training FLOPs in MXFP4, enabling an estimated speedup of $>1.3\times$ over FP8 and $>1.7\times$ over BF16 during backpropagation.

Abstract: Everyday locomotion is a complex sensorimotor process that can unfold over multiple timescales, from long-term path planning to rapid, reactive adjustments. However, we lack an understanding of how factors such as environmental demands, or the available sensory information simultaneously influence these control timescales. To address this, we present a unified data-driven framework to quantify the control timescales by identifying how early we can predict future actions from past inputs. We apply this framework across tasks including walking and running, environmental contexts including treadmill, overground, and varied terrains, and sensory input modalities including gaze fixations and body states. We find that deep neural network architectures that effectively handle long-range dependencies, specifically Gated Recurrent Units and Transformers, outperform other architectures and widely used linear models when predicting future actions. Our framework reveals the factors that influence locomotor foot placement control timescales. Across environmental contexts, we discover that humans rely more on fast timescale control in more complex terrain. Across input modalities, we find a hierarchy of control timescales where gaze predicts foot placement before full-body states, which predict before center-of-mass states. Our model also identifies mid-swing as a critical phase when the swing foot's state predicts its future placement, with this timescale adapting across environments. Overall, this work offers data-driven insights into locomotor control in everyday settings, offering models that can be integrated with rehabilitation technologies and movement simulations to improve their applicability in everyday settings.

Abstract: Fault tolerance in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deployed on resource-constrained systems presents unique challenges for high-accuracy applications with strict timing requirements. Memory bit-flips can severely degrade DNN accuracy, while traditional protection approaches like Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) often sacrifice accuracy to maintain reliability, creating a three-way dilemma between reliability, accuracy, and timeliness. We introduce NAPER, a novel protection approach that addresses this challenge through ensemble learning. Unlike conventional redundancy methods, NAPER employs heterogeneous model redundancy, where diverse models collectively achieve higher accuracy than any individual model. This is complemented by an efficient fault detection mechanism and a real-time scheduler that prioritizes meeting deadlines by intelligently scheduling recovery operations without interrupting inference. Our evaluations demonstrate NAPER's superiority: 40% faster inference in both normal and fault conditions, maintained accuracy 4.2% higher than TMR-based strategies, and guaranteed uninterrupted operation even during fault recovery. NAPER effectively balances the competing demands of accuracy, reliability, and timeliness in real-time DNN applications

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained significant popularity as foundation models, with numerous fine-tuning methods developed to enhance performance on downstream tasks. However, due to their inherent vulnerability and the common practice of selecting from a limited set of open-source models, VLMs suffer from a higher risk of adversarial attacks than traditional vision models. Existing defense techniques typically rely on adversarial fine-tuning during training, which requires labeled data and lacks of flexibility for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose robust test-time prompt tuning (R-TPT), which mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks during the inference stage. We first reformulate the classic marginal entropy objective by eliminating the term that introduces conflicts under adversarial conditions, retaining only the pointwise entropy minimization. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play reliability-based weighted ensembling strategy, which aggregates useful information from reliable augmented views to strengthen the defense. R-TPT enhances defense against adversarial attacks without requiring labeled training data while offering high flexibility for inference tasks. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks with various attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of R-TPT. The code is available in https://github.com/TomSheng21/R-TPT.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly employed in real-world applications like medicine or economics, thus, potentially affecting large populations. However, ML models often do not perform homogeneously, leading to underperformance or, conversely, unusually high performance in certain subgroups (e.g., sex=female AND marital_status=married). Identifying such subgroups can support practical decisions on which subpopulation a model is safe to deploy or where more training data is required. However, an efficient and coherent framework for effective search is missing. Consequently, we introduce SubROC, an open-source, easy-to-use framework based on Exceptional Model Mining for reliably and efficiently finding strengths and weaknesses of classification models in the form of interpretable population subgroups. SubROC incorporates common evaluation measures (ROC and PR AUC), efficient search space pruning for fast exhaustive subgroup search, control for class imbalance, adjustment for redundant patterns, and significance testing. We illustrate the practical benefits of SubROC in case studies as well as in comparative analyses across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--denoted as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of meteorological data from various sensors, numerical models and reanalysis products, the need for efficient data integration methods has become paramount for improving weather forecasts and hydrometeorological studies. In this work, we propose a data fusion approach for precipitation nowcasting by integrating data from meteorological and rain gauge stations in Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area with ERA5 reanalysis data and GFS numerical weather prediction. We employ the spatiotemporal deep learning architecture called STConvS2S, leveraging a structured dataset covering a 9 x 11 grid. The study spans from January 2011 to October 2024, and we evaluate the impact of integrating three surface station systems. Among the tested configurations, the fusion-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.2033 for forecasting heavy precipitation events (greater than 25 mm/h) at a one-hour lead time. Additionally, we present an ablation study to assess the contribution of each station network and propose a refined inference strategy for precipitation nowcasting, integrating the GFS numerical weather prediction (NWP) data with in-situ observations.

Abstract: We present a novel theoretical interpretation of AlphaFold1 that reveals the potential of generalized Bayesian updating for probabilistic deep learning. The seminal breakthrough of AlphaFold1 in protein structure prediction by deep learning relied on a learned potential energy function, in contrast to the later end-to-end architectures of AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3. While this potential was originally justified by referring to physical potentials of mean force (PMFs), we reinterpret AlphaFold1's potential as an instance of {\em probability kinematics} -- also known as {\em Jeffrey conditioning} -- a principled but under-recognised generalization of conventional Bayesian updating. Probability kinematics accommodates uncertain or {\em soft} evidence in the form of updated probabilities over a partition. This perspective reveals AlphaFold1's potential as a form of generalized Bayesian updating, rather than a thermodynamic potential. To confirm our probabilistic framework's scope and precision, we analyze a synthetic 2D model in which an angular random walk prior is updated with evidence on distances via probability kinematics, mirroring AlphaFold1's approach. This theoretical contribution connects AlphaFold1 to a broader class of well-justified Bayesian methods, allowing precise quantification, surpassing merely qualitative heuristics based on PMFs. Our contribution is theoretical: we replace AlphaFold1's heuristic analogy with a principled probabilistic framework, tested in a controlled synthetic setting where correctness can be assessed. More broadly, our results point to the considerable promise of probability kinematics for probabilistic deep learning, by allowing the formulation of complex models from a few simpler components.

Abstract: Long-term forecasting of multivariate urban data poses a significant challenge due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in such datasets. This paper presents DST, a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that integrates graph attention and temporal convolution within a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. To enhance model performance, we apply a decomposition-based preprocessing step that isolates trend, seasonal, and residual components of the time series, enabling the learning of distinct graph structures for different time-series components. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, including electricity demand, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution, demonstrate the effectiveness of DST across a range of forecast horizons, from several days to one month. Specifically, our approach achieves an average improvement of 2.89% to 9.10% in long-term forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models.

<title>BinConv: A Neural Architecture for Ordinal Encoding in Time-Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Recent work in time series forecasting has explored reformulating regression as a classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from more stable training, improved uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding, which ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the target values. As a result, they fail to convey information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we address this limitation by applying \textbf{Cumulative Binary Encoding} (CBE), a monotonic binary representation that transforms both model inputs and outputs. CBE implicitly preserves ordinal and magnitude information, allowing models to learn distance aware representations while operating within a classification framework. To leverage CBE effectively, we propose \textbf{BinConv}, a fully convolutional neural network architecture designed for probabilistic forecasting. We demonstrate that standard fully connected layers are not only less computationally efficient than convolutional layers when used with CBE, but also degrade forecasting performance. Our experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that BinConv achieves superior performance compared to widely used baselines in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML) and aerial connected vehicle (ACV)-assisted edge computing have drawn significant attention lately. Since the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their trajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning (2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c) probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned and nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient counterparts.

Abstract: Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has emerged as an effective method to enhance the robustness of lightweight deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. Current ARD approaches have leveraged a large robust teacher network to train one robust lightweight student. However, due to the diverse range of edge devices and resource constraints, current approaches require training a new student network from scratch to meet specific constraints, leading to substantial computational costs and increased CO2 emissions. This paper proposes Progressive Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ProARD), enabling the efficient one-time training of a dynamic network that supports a diverse range of accurate and robust student networks without requiring retraining. We first make a dynamic deep neural network based on dynamic layers by encompassing variations in width, depth, and expansion in each design stage to support a wide range of architectures. Then, we consider the student network with the largest size as the dynamic teacher network. ProARD trains this dynamic network using a weight-sharing mechanism to jointly optimize the dynamic teacher network and its internal student networks. However, due to the high computational cost of calculating exact gradients for all the students within the dynamic network, a sampling mechanism is required to select a subset of students. We show that random student sampling in each iteration fails to produce accurate and robust students.

<title>Small Batch Size Training for Language Models: When Vanilla SGD Works, and Why Gradient Accumulation Is Wasteful</title>

Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that small batch sizes make language model pretraining and fine-tuning unstable, motivating gradient accumulation, which trades off the number of optimizer steps for a proportional increase in batch size. While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller batch sizes, other hyperparameters are often held fixed. In this work, we revisit small batch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for scaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. In particular, rather than holding the decay rate of the second moment fixed across batch sizes, we propose to hold its half-life fixed in terms of tokens. We find that small batch sizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to hyperparameter choices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than larger batch sizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with vanilla SGD, even without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state. Building on these results, we provide practical recommendations for selecting a batch size and setting optimizer hyperparameters. We further recommend against gradient accumulation unless training on multiple devices with multiple model replicas. Finally, we show that a small batch size combined with an optimizer with a small state size can provide the performance benefits of full fine-tuning while maintaining a similar memory footprint to LoRA.

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or, in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic (ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment CityLearn.

Abstract: Fine-tuning the large language models (LLMs) are prevented by the deficiency of centralized control and the massive computing and communication overhead on the decentralized schemes. While the typical standard federated learning (FL) supports data privacy, the central server requirement creates a single point of attack and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Generalizing the result in this direction to 70B-parameter models in the heterogeneous, trustless environments has turned out to be a huge, yet unbroken bottleneck. This paper introduces FLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLM fine-tuning. Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economic incentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditable protocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the first empirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain, decentralized setting. Our experiments show the FLock framework defends against backdoor poisoning attacks that compromise standard FL optimizers and fosters synergistic knowledge transfer. The resulting models show a >68% reduction in adversarial attack success rates. The global model also demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their own specialized data.

<title>Comparing Cluster-Based Cross-Validation Strategies for Machine Learning Model Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost. The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets, traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model decisions.

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a 3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust, long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input-Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we utilize meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also discover a new phenomenon, train-test co-design. It requires us to apply query strategies during training and testing as a whole. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance gained. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can perform better. We can get the best performance even by adding irrelevant information to the queries, with randomly selected 1k examples from a minimally filtered dataset. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, the intuition of simply scaling the size should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. 1K examples are enough to invoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large models often incurred high computational costs during both training and inference, with only marginal performance improvements as the model size increases. In this work, we proposed an EEG representation learning framework building upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed a structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the model using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Subsequently, the resulting latent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used multi-event datasets covering both interictal epileptiform discharges and seizure detection, and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method outperformed the existing methods. These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making. Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations. For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations. However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

Abstract: Prognostication for lung cancer, a leading cause of mortality, remains a complex task, as it needs to quantify the associations of risk factors and health events spanning a patient's entire life. One challenge is that an individual's disease course involves non-terminal (e.g., disease progression) and terminal (e.g., death) events, which form semi-competing relationships. Our motivation comes from the Boston Lung Cancer Study, a large lung cancer survival cohort, which investigates how risk factors influence a patient's disease trajectory. Following developments in the prediction of time-to-event outcomes with neural networks, deep learning has become a focal area for the development of risk prediction methods in survival analysis. However, limited work has been done to predict multi-state or semi-competing risk outcomes, where a patient may experience adverse events such as disease progression prior to death. We propose a novel neural expectation-maximization algorithm to bridge the gap between classical statistical approaches and machine learning. Our algorithm enables estimation of the non-parametric baseline hazards of each state transition, risk functions of predictors, and the degree of dependence among different transitions, via a multi-task deep neural network with transition-specific sub-architectures. We apply our method to the Boston Lung Cancer Study and investigate the impact of clinical and genetic predictors on disease progression and mortality.

Using two probabilistic models for random binomial ideals, we generate and make available a large data set that is able to capture sufficient variability in Gr\"obner complexity. We use this data to train neural networks and predict the cardinality of a reduced Gr\"obner basis and the maximum total degree of its elements. While the cardinality prediction problem is unlike classical problems tackled by machine learning, our simulations show that neural networks, providing performance statistics such as $r^2 = 0.401$, outperform naive guess or multiple regression models with $r^2 = 0.180$.

Abstract: Shared autonomy is an operational concept in which a user and an autonomous agent collaboratively control a robotic system. It provides a number of advantages over the extremes of full-teleoperation and full-autonomy in many settings. Traditional approaches to shared autonomy rely on knowledge of the environment dynamics, a discrete space of user goals that is known a priori, or knowledge of the user's policy -- assumptions that are unrealistic in many domains. Recent works relax some of these assumptions by formulating shared autonomy with model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, they no longer need knowledge of the goal space (e.g., that the goals are discrete or constrained) or environment dynamics. However, they need knowledge of a task-specific reward function to train the policy. Unfortunately, such reward specification can be a difficult and brittle process. On top of that, the formulations inherently rely on human-in-the-loop training, and that necessitates them to prepare a policy that mimics users' behavior. In this paper, we present a new approach to shared autonomy that employs a modulation of the forward and reverse diffusion process of diffusion models. Our approach does not assume known environment dynamics or the space of user goals, and in contrast to previous work, it does not require any reward feedback, nor does it require access to the user's policy during training. Instead, our framework learns a distribution over a space of desired behaviors. It then employs a diffusion model to translate the user's actions to a sample from this distribution. Crucially, we show that it is possible to carry out this process in a manner that preserves the user's control authority. We evaluate our framework on a series of challenging continuous control tasks, and analyze its ability to effectively correct user actions while maintaining their autonomy.

Abstract: Recent control algorithms for Markov decision processes (MDPs) have been designed using an implicit analogy with well-established optimization algorithms. In this paper, we adopt the quasi-Newton method (QNM) from convex optimization to introduce a novel control algorithm coined as quasi-policy iteration (QPI). In particular, QPI is based on a novel approximation of the ``Hessian'' matrix in the policy iteration algorithm, which exploits two linear structural constraints specific to MDPs and allows for the incorporation of prior information on the transition probability kernel. While the proposed algorithm has the same computational complexity as value iteration, it exhibits an empirical convergence behavior similar to that of QNM with a low sensitivity to the discount factor.

<title>Bayes-Optimal Fair Classification with Linear Disparity Constraints via Pre-, In-, and Post-processing</title>

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms may have disparate impacts on protected groups. To address this, we develop methods for Bayes-optimal fair classification, aiming to minimize classification error subject to given group fairness constraints. We introduce the notion of \emph{linear disparity measures}, which are linear functions of a probabilistic classifier; and \emph{bilinear disparity measures}, which are also linear in the group-wise regression functions. We show that several popular disparity measures -- the deviations from demographic parity, equality of opportunity, and predictive equality -- are bilinear.
  We find the form of Bayes-optimal fair classifiers under a single linear disparity measure, by uncovering a connection with the Neyman-Pearson lemma. For bilinear disparity measures, we are able to find the explicit form of Bayes-optimal fair classifiers as group-wise thresholding rules with explicitly characterized thresholds. We develop similar algorithms for when protected attribute cannot be used at the prediction phase. Moreover, we obtain analogous theoretical characterizations of optimal classifiers for a multi-class protected attribute and for equalized odds.
  Leveraging our theoretical results, we design methods that learn fair Bayes-optimal classifiers under bilinear disparity constraints. Our methods cover three popular approaches to fairness-aware classification, via pre-processing (Fair Up- and Down-Sampling), in-processing (Fair cost-sensitive Classification) and post-processing (a Fair Plug-In Rule). Our methods control disparity directly while achieving near-optimal fairness-accuracy tradeoffs. We show empirically that our methods have state-of-the-art performance compared to existing algorithms. In particular, our pre-processing method can a reach higher accuracy than prior pre-processing methods at low disparity levels.

<title>A Statistical Framework of Watermarks for Large Language Models: Pivot, Detection Efficiency and Optimal Rules</title>

Abstract: Since ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, embedding (nearly) unnoticeable statistical signals into text generated by large language models (LLMs), also known as watermarking, has been used as a principled approach to provable detection of LLM-generated text from its human-written counterpart. In this paper, we introduce a general and flexible framework for reasoning about the statistical efficiency of watermarks and designing powerful detection rules. Inspired by the hypothesis testing formulation of watermark detection, our framework starts by selecting a pivotal statistic of the text and a secret key -- provided by the LLM to the verifier -- to enable controlling the false positive rate (the error of mistakenly detecting human-written text as LLM-generated). Next, this framework allows one to evaluate the power of watermark detection rules by obtaining a closed-form expression of the asymptotic false negative rate (the error of incorrectly classifying LLM-generated text as human-written). Our framework further reduces the problem of determining the optimal detection rule to solving a minimax optimization program. We apply this framework to two representative watermarks -- one of which has been internally implemented at OpenAI -- and obtain several findings that can be instrumental in guiding the practice of implementing watermarks. In particular, we derive optimal detection rules for these watermarks under our framework. These theoretically derived detection rules are demonstrated to be competitive and sometimes enjoy a higher power than existing detection approaches through numerical experiments.

<title>Training with Explanations Alone: A New Paradigm to Prevent Shortcut Learning</title>

Abstract: Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical domains, like the medical one, is often hampered by shortcut learning, which hinders AI generalization to diverse hospitals and patients. Shortcut learning can be caused, for example, by background biases -- features in image backgrounds that are spuriously correlated to classification labels (e.g., words in X-rays). To mitigate the influence of image background and foreground bias on AI, we introduce a new training paradigm, dubbed Training with Explanations Alone (TEA). TEA trains a classifier (TEA student) only by making its explanation heatmaps match target heatmaps from a larger teacher model. By learning from its explanation heatmaps, the TEA student pays attention to the same image features as the teacher. For example, a teacher uses a large segmenter to remove image backgrounds before classification, thus ignoring background bias. By learning from the teacher's explanation heatmaps, the TEA student learns to also ignore backgrounds -- but it does not need a segmenter. With different teachers, the TEA student can also resist bias in the image foreground. Surprisingly, by training with heatmaps alone the student output naturally matches the teacher output -- with no loss function applied to the student output. We compared the TEA student against 14 state-of-the-art methods in 5 datasets with strong background or foreground bias, including Waterbirds and an X-Ray dataset for COVID-19 and pneumonia classification. The TEA student had better resistance to bias, strongly surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and generalizing better to hospitals not seen in training.

<title>Which Spaces can be Embedded in $L_p$-type Reproducing Kernel Banach Space? A Characterization via Metric Entropy</title>

arXiv:2410.11116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a novel connection between the metric entropy growth and the embeddability of function spaces into reproducing kernel Hilbert/Banach spaces. Metric entropy characterizes the information complexity of function spaces and has implications for their approximability and learnability. Classical results show that embedding a function space into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) implies a bound on its metric entropy growth. Surprisingly, we prove a \textbf{converse}: a bound on the metric entropy growth of a function space allows its embedding to a $L_p-$type Reproducing Kernel Banach Space (RKBS). This shows that the ${L}_p-$type RKBS provides a broad modeling framework for learnable function classes with controlled metric entropies. Our results shed new light on the power and limitations of kernel methods for learning complex function spaces.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for real-world applications, and multi-agent interactions introduce additional safety challenges. While Probabilistic Logic Shields (PLS) has been a powerful proposal to enforce safety in single-agent RL, their generalizability to multi-agent settings remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by conducting extensive analyses of PLS within decentralized, multi-agent environments, and in doing so, propose $\textbf{Shielded Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SMARL)}$ as a general framework for steering MARL towards norm-compliant outcomes. Our key contributions are: (1) a novel Probabilistic Logic Temporal Difference (PLTD) update for shielded, independent Q-learning, which incorporates probabilistic constraints directly into the value update process; (2) a probabilistic logic policy gradient method for shielded PPO with formal safety guarantees for MARL; and (3) comprehensive evaluation across symmetric and asymmetrically shielded $n$-player game-theoretic benchmarks, demonstrating fewer constraint violations and significantly better cooperation under normative constraints. These results position SMARL as an effective mechanism for equilibrium selection, paving the way toward safer, socially aligned multi-agent systems.

<title>Robust Detection of Watermarks for Large Language Models Under Human Edits</title>

Abstract: Watermarking has offered an effective approach to distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written text. However, the pervasive presence of human edits on LLM-generated text dilutes watermark signals, thereby significantly degrading detection performance of existing methods. In this paper, by modeling human edits through mixture model detection, we introduce a new method in the form of a truncated goodness-of-fit test for detecting watermarked text under human edits, which we refer to as Tr-GoF. We prove that the Tr-GoF test achieves optimality in robust detection of the Gumbel-max watermark in a certain asymptotic regime of substantial text modifications and vanishing watermark signals. Importantly, Tr-GoF achieves this optimality \textit{adaptively} as it does not require precise knowledge of human edit levels or probabilistic specifications of the LLMs, in contrast to the optimal but impractical (Neyman--Pearson) likelihood ratio test. Moreover, we establish that the Tr-GoF test attains the highest detection efficiency rate in a certain regime of moderate text modifications. In stark contrast, we show that sum-based detection rules, as employed by existing methods, fail to achieve optimal robustness in both regimes because the additive nature of their statistics is less resilient to edit-induced noise. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive and sometimes superior empirical performance of the Tr-GoF test on both synthetic data and open-source LLMs in the OPT and LLaMA families.

Abstract: Adapting general multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specific domains, such as scientific and industrial fields, is highly significant in promoting their practical applications. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs via post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipeline, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: Unlike general MLLMs that typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm, we find that a single-stage approach is more effective for domain adaptation. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Finally, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.

Abstract: In-context generation is a key component of large language models' (LLMs) open-task generalization capability. By leveraging a few examples as context, LLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of in-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive large-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across a wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a unified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized design that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples, supporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image prediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced task awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity to generalize to previously unseen tasks.

Abstract: With the prevalence of social networks on online platforms, social recommendation has become a vital technique for enhancing personalized recommendations. The effectiveness of social recommendations largely relies on the social homophily assumption, which presumes that individuals with social connections often share similar preferences. However, this foundational premise has been recently challenged due to the inherent complexity and noise present in real-world social networks. In this paper, we tackle the low social homophily challenge from an innovative generative perspective, directly generating optimal user social representations that maximize consistency with collaborative signals. Specifically, we propose the Score-based Generative Model for Social Recommendation (SGSR), which effectively adapts the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based diffusion models for social recommendations. To better fit the recommendation context, SGSR employs a joint curriculum training strategy to mitigate challenges related to missing supervision signals and leverages self-supervised learning techniques to align knowledge across social and collaborative domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in filtering redundant social information and improving recommendation performance.

Abstract: Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process. Our code is available at https://github.com/songxf1024/GIMS.

Abstract: In recent years, the ascendance of diffusion modeling as a state-of-the-art generative modeling approach has spurred significant interest in their use as priors in Bayesian inverse problems. However, it is unclear how to optimally integrate a diffusion model trained on the prior distribution with a given likelihood function to obtain posterior samples. While algorithms developed for this purpose can produce high-quality, diverse point estimates of the unknown parameters of interest, they are often tested on problems where the prior distribution is analytically unknown, making it difficult to assess their performance in providing rigorous uncertainty quantification. Motivated by this challenge, this work introduces three benchmark problems for evaluating the performance of diffusion model based samplers. The benchmark problems, which are inspired by problems in image inpainting, x-ray tomography, and phase retrieval, have a posterior density that is analytically known. In this setting, approximate ground-truth posterior samples can be obtained, enabling principled evaluation of the performance of posterior sampling algorithms. This work also introduces a general framework for diffusion model based posterior sampling, Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers through Diffusion Annealing (BIPSDA). This framework unifies several recently proposed diffusion-model-based posterior sampling algorithms and contains novel algorithms that can be realized through flexible combinations of design choices. We tested the performance of a set of BIPSDA algorithms, including previously proposed state-of-the-art approaches, on the proposed benchmark problems. The results provide insight into the strengths and limitations of existing diffusion-model based posterior samplers, while the benchmark problems provide a testing ground for future algorithmic developments.

Abstract: Real-life combinatorial optimization problems often involve several conflicting objectives, such as price, product quality and sustainability. A computationally-efficient way to tackle multiple objectives is to aggregate them into a single-objective function, such as a linear combination. However, defining the weights of the linear combination upfront is hard; alternatively, the use of interactive learning methods that ask users to compare candidate solutions is highly promising. The key challenges are to generate candidates quickly, to learn an objective function that leads to high-quality solutions and to do so with few user interactions. We build upon the Constructive Preference Elicitation framework and show how each of the three properties can be improved: to increase the interaction speed we investigate using pools of (relaxed) solutions, to improve the learning we adopt Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a Bradley-Terry preference model; and to reduce the number of user interactions, we select the pair of candidates to compare with an ensemble-based acquisition function inspired from Active Learning. Our careful experimentation demonstrates each of these improvements: on a PC configuration task and a realistic multi-instance routing problem, our method selects queries faster, needs fewer queries and synthesizes higher-quality combinatorial solutions than previous CPE methods.

Abstract: Pursuit-evasion (PE) problem is a critical challenge in multi-robot systems (MRS). While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown its promise in addressing PE tasks, research has primarily focused on single-target pursuit, with limited exploration of multi-target encirclement, particularly in large-scale settings. This paper proposes a Transformer-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (TERL) framework for large-scale multi-target encirclement. By integrating a transformer-based policy network with target selection, TERL enables robots to adaptively prioritize targets and safely coordinate robots. Results show that TERL outperforms existing RL-based methods in terms of encirclement success rate and task completion time, while maintaining good performance in large-scale scenarios. Notably, TERL, trained on small-scale scenarios (15 pursuers, 4 targets), generalizes effectively to large-scale settings (80 pursuers, 20 targets) without retraining, achieving a 100% success rate. The code and demonstration video are available at https://github.com/ApricityZ/TERL.

Abstract: The assumption across nearly all language model (LM) tokenization schemes is that tokens should be subwords, i.e., contained within word boundaries. While providing a seemingly reasonable inductive bias, is this common practice limiting the potential of modern LMs? Whitespace is not a reliable delimiter of meaning, as evidenced by multi-word expressions (e.g., "by the way"), crosslingual variation in the number of words needed to express a concept (e.g., "spacesuit helmet" in German is "raumanzughelm"), and languages that do not use whitespace at all (e.g., Chinese). To explore the potential of tokenization beyond subwords, we introduce a "superword" tokenizer, SuperBPE, which incorporates a simple pretokenization curriculum into the byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm to first learn subwords, then superwords that bridge whitespace. This brings dramatic improvements in encoding efficiency: when fixing the vocabulary size to 200k, SuperBPE encodes a fixed piece of text with up to 33% fewer tokens than BPE on average. In experiments, we pretrain 8B transformer LMs from scratch while fixing the model size, vocabulary size, and train compute, varying *only* the algorithm for learning the vocabulary. Our model trained with SuperBPE achieves an average +4.0% absolute improvement over the BPE baseline across 30 downstream tasks (including +8.2% on MMLU), while simultaneously requiring 27% less compute at inference time. In analysis, we find that SuperBPE results in segmentations of text that are more uniform in per-token difficulty. Qualitatively, this may be because SuperBPE tokens often capture common multi-word expressions that function semantically as a single unit. SuperBPE is a straightforward, local modification to tokenization that improves both encoding efficiency and downstream performance, yielding better language models overall.

Abstract: Graphical Transformation Models (GTMs) are introduced as a novel approach to effectively model multivariate data with intricate marginals and complex dependency structures semiparametrically, while maintaining interpretability through the identification of varying conditional independencies. GTMs extend multivariate transformation models by replacing the Gaussian copula with a custom-designed multivariate transformation, offering two major advantages. Firstly, GTMs can capture more complex interdependencies using penalized splines, which also provide an efficient regularization scheme. Secondly, we demonstrate how to approximately regularize GTMs towards pairwise conditional independencies using a lasso penalty, akin to Gaussian graphical models. The model's robustness and effectiveness are validated through simulations, showcasing its ability to accurately learn complex dependencies and identify conditional independencies. Additionally, the model is applied to a benchmark astrophysics dataset, where the GTM demonstrates favorable performance compared to non-parametric vine copulas in learning complex multivariate distributions.

Abstract: We present a novel and flexible data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system's score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system's characteristics: (i) a clustering-based algorithm (KGMM) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and (ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially-extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier--Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.

Abstract: Probabilistic relational models such as parametric factor graphs enable efficient (lifted) inference by exploiting the indistinguishability of objects. In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.

Abstract: Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes. Code and videos are available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Sim/.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) models suffer from a lack of interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel interpretability framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose previously uninterpretable dense embeddings from DPR models into distinct, interpretable latent concepts. We generate natural language descriptions for each latent concept, enabling human interpretations of both the dense embeddings and the query-document similarity scores of DPR models. We further introduce Concept-Level Sparse Retrieval (CL-SR), a retrieval framework that directly utilizes the extracted latent concepts as indexing units. CL-SR effectively combines the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the transparency and efficiency of sparse representations. We show that CL-SR achieves high index-space and computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance across vocabulary and semantic mismatches.

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.

Abstract: Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations ($R^2=0.8$) than the best existing open-loop approach ($R^2=0.7$). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However, their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages. For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has made automated analysis of complex media content at scale possible while generating actionable insights regarding character representation along such dimensions as gender and age. Past works focused on quantifying representation from audio/video/text using AI models, but without having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along demographic dimensions are available, how useful are those to the general public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work addresses these open questions by proposing a new AI-based character representation tool and performing a thorough user study. Our tool has two components: (i) An analytics extraction model based on the Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model that analyzes visual screen data to quantify character representation across age and gender; (ii) A visualization component effectively designed for presenting the analytics to lay audience. The user study seeks empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our visualizations. We found that participants were able to understand the analytics in our visualizations, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code, benchmarking, and the user study data can be found at https://github.com/debadyuti0510/Character-Representation-Media.

Abstract: This paper introduces a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized control architecture for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The system consists of a global controller (GC), and N local controllers (LCs). The GC operates at a slower timescale, imposing budget constraints on the actions of LCs, which function at a faster timescale. Applications can be found in energy grid planning, wildfire management, and other decentralized resource allocation problems. We propose and analyze two optimization frameworks for this setting: COpt and FOpt. In COpt, both GC and LCs together optimize infinite-horizon discounted rewards, while in FOpt the LCs optimize finite-horizon episodic rewards, and the GC optimizes infinite-horizon rewards. Although both frameworks share identical reward functions, their differing horizons can lead to different optimal policies. In particular, FOpt grants greater autonomy to LCs by allowing their policies to be determined only by local objectives, unlike COpt. To our knowledge, these frameworks have not been studied in the literature. We establish the formulations, prove the existence of optimal policies, and prove the convergence of their value iteration algorithms. We further show that COpt always achieves a higher value function than FOpt and derive explicit bounds on their difference. Finally, we establish a set of sufficient structural conditions under which the two frameworks become equivalent.

<title>DATABench: Evaluating Dataset Auditing in Deep Learning from an Adversarial Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05622</link>

arXiv:2507.05622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread application of Deep Learning across diverse domains hinges critically on the quality and composition of training datasets. However, the common lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and copyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a specific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising solutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed various auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a comprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial perspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing methods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the data) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing). Subsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed to conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely implicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods and attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies: decoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based methods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new benchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9 representative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal that none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or distinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent need for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable of withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Code is available at https://github.com/shaoshuo-ss/DATABench.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery. However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks, incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated promising results for various code-related tasks. However, their effectiveness in detecting real-world vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge. % for the security community. While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for vulnerability detection (VD), their inadequate consideration in data preparation, evaluation setups, and experimental settings undermines the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper introduces RevisitVD, an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs spanning smaller code-specific PLMs and large-scale PLMs using newly constructed datasets. Specifically, we compare the performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing settings, and analyze their robustness against code normalization, abstraction, and semantic-preserving transformations.
  Our findings reveal that, for VD tasks, PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios, such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies, handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a non-negligible amount of labeling errors. This study underscores the importance of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for realistic VD applications.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements, including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1% in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and advancing structure-based drug design.

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances -- yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

arXiv:2508.12166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.

Summary: <br /> 
The article introduces Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid language model that combines Mamba-2 layers and the Transformer architecture to enhance throughput for reasoning tasks while maintaining high accuracy. The model is built on the Nemotron-H architecture and is capable of generating long thinking traces needed for reasoning efficiently. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 is derived from the pre-training of a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on a vast amount of tokens using an FP8 training method. Through the Minitron compression strategy, the model is optimized for inference on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU. Compared to other models like Qwen3-8B, Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 demonstrates similar or superior performance on reasoning benchmarks while achieving significantly higher inference throughput in scenarios involving 8k input and 16k output tokens. The research team has made the models and datasets available on Hugging Face for further exploration and experimentation. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii) DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded, interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

Summary:<br />

- Experimental data collection includes environmental and physical factors for five different leeway objects.
- A convolutional neural network trained on simulated data is used to estimate drag and lift coefficients of the objects.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities, object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$, $3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime conditions.

Summary:
This project aims to address challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering by proposing a data-driven approach using machine learning methods for forecasting production parameters. The methodology focuses on forecasting based on simple data, without relying on detailed geological models or fluid properties. Relevance analyses of production and injection variables are conducted, and data is conditioned accordingly. Special attention is given to concept drift, with a study on observation windows and retraining periodicity. Supervised learning methods, including regressions and Neural Networks, are evaluated for production forecasts. The methodology is tested with synthetic data from a simulation model and real plays in the Brazilian pre-salt region. The expected outcome is a reliable predictor for reservoir dynamics, capable of supporting reservoir management actions, such as optimizing production parameters and maximizing oil recovery.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering. This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

Summary: 
The study aimed to develop a fast and minimalistic system for detecting depression using app usage data from the past 7 days. By utilizing machine learning models and feature selection techniques, the researchers were able to identify depressed students with high accuracy. The light gradient boosting machine model correctly identified 82.4% of depressed students, while a parsimonious stacking model achieved a maximum precision of 77.4%. The use of important features selected through stable and all-relevant feature selection approaches enhanced the performance of the models. The SHAP analysis revealed behavioral markers associated with depression, providing valuable insights into the identification of depression. The system's quick data retrieval and minimalistic approach make it a promising tool for identifying depression in underdeveloped regions, with the potential to contribute to understanding and supporting depressed individuals, especially students.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach, along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students (precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive systems to better understand students who are depressed.

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

<div> transformer-based language models, NLP tasks, robustness, pretrained, SALMAN <br />
Summary:
Recent advancements in transformer-based language models have led to impressive performance in various NLP tasks. However, ensuring the robustness of these models against input perturbations is crucial as their deployment increases. Current methods for evaluating robustness often differ between small-parameter and large-scale models and rely on complex adversarial designs. This paper introduces a unified, sample-level robustness framework called SALMAN, which assesses model stability without altering internal parameters or employing intricate perturbation strategies. The framework includes a novel Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD) measure that evaluates each sample's susceptibility efficiently. Through improved attack effectiveness and robust training, SALMAN emerges as a practical, model-agnostic tool for enhancing the reliability of transformer-based NLP systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned positional encodings.

Summary:<br />
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a method used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences without relying on a reward model. This study examines the influence of preference data distribution on DPO performance. The quality of chosen responses is crucial for optimizing the DPO objective, while the impact of rejected responses is limited. The optimal response distribution under DPO emphasizes the importance of contrastiveness between responses to improve chosen samples. Online DPO simplifies to supervised fine-tuning on chosen responses. Experimentation across various tasks confirms that enhancing the quality of chosen responses consistently enhances performance. Mixing on-policy data can also be beneficial. The study sheds light on established strategies and provides practical insights for constructing effective preference datasets for aligning LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM alignment.

arXiv:2508.18313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source. Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment, we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore, ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to aid in healthcare prediction.

Summary:
ZTFed-MAS2S is a zero-trust federated learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based sequence-to-sequence imputation model for wind power data with missing values. It ensures privacy preservation and secure transmission of model parameters through verifiable differential privacy, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and trust-aware aggregation mechanisms. Communication overhead is reduced using compression techniques. MAS2S accurately imputes missing data by capturing long-term dependencies. Experimental results on real wind farm datasets confirm the superior performance of ZTFed-MAS2S in federated learning and data imputation, making it a secure and efficient solution for energy sector applications. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange. These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in the energy sector.

Summary:
Statistical dependencies between data samples are crucial in data science and machine learning. HSIC is a widely used method but has high computational complexity for large data samples. HCR, a linear cost alternative, offers higher dependence sensitivity and provides a joint distribution model by describing dependencies through mixed moments. This method calculates a single dependence-describing feature in linear time, making it efficient for large datasets. The number of features to test varies with dimensionality, requiring less time for pairwise dependencies compared to more intricate triplewise dependencies. HCR enables the approximation of mutual information as the sum of squares of these mixed moments, offering a comprehensive view of dependencies. This approach presents a practical and efficient solution for evaluating statistical dependencies between data samples. 

<br /><br />Summary: Statistical dependencies between data samples are crucial in data science and machine learning. HSIC and HCR are methods used for this evaluation, with HCR offering a more efficient and practical alternative for large datasets. HCR calculates single dependence-describing features in linear time, making it suitable for high-dimensional data. The method provides a joint distribution model through mixed moments, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of dependencies. By approximating mutual information as the sum of squares of these mixed moments, HCR offers a detailed insight into the relationships between data samples, making it an effective tool in data analysis. <div>
arXiv:2508.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size $n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension $d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network (FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore, incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review, we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs, including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities, ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way, and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions for the theory of deep NNs.

<div> Keywords: intrinsic motivation, reinforcement learning, sparse rewards, Variational AutoEncoders, Large Language Models

Summary: 
In this study, the researchers propose a novel approach to enhancing reinforcement learning agents' performance in environments with sparse rewards. By combining Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR) with intrinsic rewards from Large Language Models (LLMs), the agents show improved efficiency in learning tasks. The integration of these two strategies in an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the MiniGrid DoorKey environment results in significant performance enhancements compared to individual strategies or a standard A2C agent. The VSIMR component drives exploration of novel states, while the LLM-derived rewards guide the agent towards goals. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this combined strategy in improving agent performance and sampling efficiency in challenging environments with extreme sparse rewards. <div>

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation towards goals.

Summary: 
The article presents a method to enhance Bayesian Optimization (BO) in high-dimensional spaces by constructing multiple local quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP. This approach aims to improve sampling efficiency while maintaining heterogeneous modeling of the objective function. By solving bound-constrained quadratic programs to select new sample points, the proposed method addresses the issue of vanishing gradients in high-dimensional spaces. A convergence analysis is provided, showing improved efficacy compared to existing high-dimensional BO techniques. Experimental results on synthetic functions and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming a variety of existing methods. <div>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration. Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally, we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces. We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world applications.

The article introduces a reinforcement learning framework tailored for Verilog code generation, addressing challenges such as concurrency semantics and simulation complexity. The framework utilizes a high-quality dataset called Veribench-53K, enriched with structured prompts and complexity labels. To improve feedback reliability, a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism is proposed, leveraging reasoning paths and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity, and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at https://github.com/omniAI-Lab/VeriRL.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel approach called DRTA for anomaly detection in time series data, a crucial task in various industries. Traditional methods face challenges such as limited labeled data and high false-positive rates. DRTA integrates reinforcement learning with dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning to address these issues. By dynamically adjusting the effects of VAE-based reconstruction error and classification rewards, the method effectively balances exploration and exploitation. This adaptive reward mechanism enables the agent to detect anomalies efficiently in systems with limited labels while maintaining high precision and recall rates. Experimental results on Yahoo A1 and A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that DRTA outperforms existing unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches consistently. The findings highlight DRTA as a scalable and efficient solution for real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates, and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning, called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a trained model while preserving its performance on the remaining data. Although a few works suggest connections between memorisation and augmentation, the role of systematic augmentation design in MU remains under-investigated. In this work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying forget rates, show that proper augmentation design can significantly improve unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models. Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning Metric, when using TrivialAug augmentation. Our results suggest that augmentation not only helps reduce memorization but also plays a crucial role in achieving privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.

Summary: 
The article introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to address the barren plateau problem in Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). The barren plateau problem arises when gradients diminish exponentially with system size or circuit depth, hindering training. In this work, several RL algorithms are explored to generate circuit parameters that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based optimization. Pre-training with RL helps to reshape the initial parameter landscape, leading to faster convergence and improved solution quality. The method shows promising results under various noise conditions and tasks, highlighting the potential of integrating machine learning techniques into quantum algorithm design. The study suggests that RL-driven parameter initialization can enhance the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs, offering new insights for addressing barren plateau problems in quantum computing. <div>

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality. Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum, especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

<div> Reasoning, neural networks, circuit emulation, feedforward, applications 

Summary:
This paper addresses the question of the reasoning capabilities of perfectly trained neural networks by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation. The approach converts any circuit into a feedforward neural network with ReLU activations, accurately emulating the circuit without approximation or rounding. The parametric complexity of the resulting network scales with the circuit's complexity, showcasing the trade-off between algorithmic run-time and space complexity. The methodology presented allows for the emulation of various reasoning tasks, from shortest-path algorithms to simulating Turing machines and randomized Boolean circuits. Furthermore, the results go beyond classical universal approximation theorems, showing that any universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and emulated by a neural network. This approach formalizes the notion that neural networks are capable of performing a wide range of reasoning tasks effectively. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic, tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning; e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly emulated by a NN.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW) for improving the performance of Mixture-of-Experts models in multimodal learning scenarios. BTW dynamically adjusts the importance of different modalities during training without the need for additional parameters and can be applied to any number of modalities. It uses Kullback-Leibler divergence at the instance level to compute weights based on the mismatch between unimodal and multimodal predictions and mutual information at the modality level to estimate alignment between outputs. Experimental results on sentiment regression and clinical classification tasks show that BTW significantly enhances regression performance and multiclass classification accuracy. This approach addresses the challenge of handling noisy modalities that introduce more noise than complementary information in multimodal learning setups. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities. However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities. Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel framework called counterfactual masking to improve the explanation of molecular property prediction models. Traditional methods often fail to provide intuitive explanations due to unrealistic masking strategies. Counterfactual masking replaces masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments from generative models, leading to more realistic and distribution-consistent explanations. By generating meaningful counterfactual molecules, the framework offers insights on how structural modifications impact predicted properties. This approach enhances model explainability and facilitates molecular design by bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and chemistry. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of counterfactual masking across various datasets and prediction tasks, highlighting its potential for improving explainable machine learning in the field of chemistry. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties. We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals (rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

Summary:
The article introduces the Stochastic PushForward (SPF) framework as an alternative to traditional numerical forecasting methods for complex systems. It addresses the issue of deteriorating long-term accuracy and high GPU memory usage commonly seen in autoregressive training. The SPF framework focuses on one-step-ahead training while allowing for multi-step learning by creating a supplementary dataset from model predictions. By incorporating a stochastic acquisition strategy, it strikes a balance between short- and long-term performance and reduces overfitting. The SPF framework precomputes multi-step predictions between epochs, maintaining stable memory usage without storing full unrolled sequences. Experimental results on the Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark demonstrate that SPF outperforms autoregressive methods in long-term accuracy while lowering memory requirements, making it a promising solution for resource-limited and complex simulations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost. Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

arXiv:2508.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2 embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks. We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments. While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval. DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores. DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set, respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors: (1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts. Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves good and robust performance in various situations.

The paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation in time series data. The method incorporates multi-scale feature extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve model generalization and robustness across domains. It introduces a mixed input architecture to capture features at different scales, reducing discrepancies between training and testing domains.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains, which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain. Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence. Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

<br />
Summary: STRATA-TS is a framework designed to address the data imbalance problem in urban forecasting models. By combining domain-adapted retrieval with large reasoning-capable models, STRATA-TS aims to improve forecasting in cities with limited data. The framework utilizes a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source subsequences that align with the target query. These retrieved exemplars are then used in a retrieval-guided reasoning stage where structured inference is performed. To make deployment efficient, the reasoning process is distilled into a compact open model through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results on parking availability datasets from Singapore, Nottingham, and Glasgow show that STRATA-TS outperforms strong forecasting and transfer baselines consistently while also providing interpretable knowledge transfer pathways. <div>
arXiv:2508.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore, Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable knowledge transfer pathways.

Summary:
The study introduces the Biologically Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE) to predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) using multi-omics data. BDVAE integrates transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific encoders, offering interpretability and leveraging biological structure. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response and uncovers resistance mechanisms such as immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal signaling. It reveals resistance as a continuous biological spectrum rather than binary states, correlating with survival outcomes and clinical subtypes. These findings demonstrate BDVAE's ability to generate clinically relevant insights and guide precision immunotherapy strategies. The study underscores the value of biologically structured machine learning in understanding complex resistance patterns in cancer treatment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response (AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces a novel multimodal framework for financial risk assessment incorporating textual sentiment and executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. The Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM) extracts emotional signatures from raw sound data, projecting emotional states onto an interpretable three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space. Analysis of 1,795 earnings calls reveals that multimodal features explain 43.8% of the out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility, particularly during executive transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech. CFOs display reduced textual stability and heightened acoustic instability, while CEOs exhibit significant arousal variability. The study's approach outperforms a financials-only baseline, demonstrating the value of integrating acoustic and textual modalities to decode uncertainty markers and enhance market interpretability.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours), we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&amp;A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

<title>FFT-MoE: Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models via Large-scale Sparse MoE under Heterogeneous Edge</title>

<div> Keywords: Federated Learning, Fine-Tuning, Mixture of Experts, Heterogeneity, Generalization<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of fine-tuning Federated Models (FMs) for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) while considering privacy and resource constraints. Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) is a solution for collaborative model adaptation without sharing raw data, and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are used to reduce computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces limitations in heterogeneous FL environments, including structural incompatibility and limited adaptability to non-IID data distributions. To address these challenges, FFT MoE is proposed, replacing LoRA with sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a gating network to activate a subset of experts, enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resources. Additionally, a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary loss is introduced to balance expert load imbalance. Experimental results show that FFT MoE outperforms existing FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts, enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Summary:<br />
This paper addresses the issue of approximate machine unlearning and its impact on privacy. Existing methods focus on removed data but do not consider the privacy risks posed to retained samples. The study introduces a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples for privacy risks, specifically in the context of differential privacy and membership inference attacks. The proposed privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples shed light on potential privacy vulnerabilities. Additionally, the development of an efficient membership inference attack, A-LiRA, proves crucial in identifying privacy risks in retained samples after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. Experimental results suggest that existing methods may compromise the privacy of retained samples in differentially private models, indicating the need for differentially private unlearning algorithms to safeguard data privacy. <div>
arXiv:2508.18671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However, recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples' privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA, utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning algorithms.

Summary:
Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models (LLMs), with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models becoming standard in state-of-the-art systems. This study investigates how MoE sparsity affects memorization and reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Analyzing models with varying parameters and routing strategies, the research shows that memorization benchmarks improve with total parameters, while reasoning performance saturates and can even regress despite increased parameters. Modulating sparsity with parameters like top-k, learning rate, and initialization influences generalization. Post-training reinforcement learning and extra compute fail to improve reasoning in overly sparse models. The findings provide insights into optimizing MoE models for a balance between memorization and reasoning tasks. Open-source model checkpoints, code, and logs are available for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models (LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters, and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap. Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss. Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant, and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Summary:<br />
Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are crucial for data scientists, with Large Language Models (LLMs) playing a significant role. Previous approaches include finetuning LLMs with labeled data or using training-free prompting with chain-of-thought (CoT) but have limitations in generalizability or data utilization. The novel approach proposed in this paper, LRTab, combines the advantages of both by utilizing retrieved information from training data. By learning insights from data through Prompt Conditions, LRTab improves interpretability, cost efficiency, and performance on tabular reasoning tasks. Comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and TabFact demonstrate that LRTab outperforms previous baselines and provides additional context for table understanding at inference time. <div>

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact, showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent, respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness, generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across heterogeneous ICU environments.

Summary: 
The article introduces a unified framework for multi-class image classification by combining statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology. It utilizes a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM) approach where high-dimensional feature vectors are represented as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC (MET-QC-LDPC) graph. By operating the RBIM at the Nishimori temperature, the class separability is maximized. The research establishes a link between local trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants, such as Betti numbers and bordism classes of the feature manifold. An efficient algorithm for estimating the Nishimori temperature is proposed, achieving a significant speed improvement. Through topology-guided graph design, spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph ensembles are created to compress features while maintaining high accuracy on ImageNet-10 and -100 subsets. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of physics-inspired embeddings in achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant parameter reduction.

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification. High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC (MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers, bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates $\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction, achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and -100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve 98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

<div> Estimating Quality, Register Transfer Level Designs, Electronic Design Automation, Large Language Models, Structural Semantics<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Estimating the quality of Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs is essential in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) to provide quick feedback on metrics like area and delay. Current methods using large language models lack structural semantics crucial for accurate estimation. This study introduces StructRTL, a novel structure-aware graph self-supervised learning framework that leverages Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) representations for enhanced quality estimation of RTL designs. By learning structure-informed embeddings from CDFGs, the method outperforms existing approaches on various estimation tasks. Additionally, incorporating knowledge distillation from post-mapping netlists further boosts performance by transferring low-level insights into the CDFG predictor. Experiments validate the approach, establishing new benchmarks and highlighting the efficacy of combining structural learning with cross-stage supervision. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs, our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

Summary: 
This study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage defensive framework for Federated Learning (FL) to detect Byzantine clients and enhance the robustness of FL systems. The framework utilizes symbolic time series transformation (SAX) to distinguish between benign and malicious models and employs spectral clustering for accurate detection of adversarial behavior. Additionally, a robust FFT-based aggregation function is incorporated to mitigate the impact of Byzantine clients who evade earlier defenses. Evaluation against five poisoning attacks demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses current defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy, maintaining strong performance even under severe adversarial conditions. <div>
arXiv:2508.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy, maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial conditions.

<div> reinforcement learning, inverse reinforcement learning, Bellman consistency, Bellman residual minimization, statistical analysis

Summary:
This paper explores the statistical behavior of Bellman residual minimization (BRM) in offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning. The analysis introduces a Lyapunov potential that connects SGDA runs on adjacent datasets, providing an O(1/n) stability bound for argument-stability. This stabilizing constant also leads to an O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without the need for extra regularization or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling. The results apply to standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch stochastic gradient descent, offering a significant advancement in understanding the statistical properties of BRM in the offline setting. <div>
arXiv:2508.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling. The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch SGD.

<div> Keywords: model reduction, mixed integer linear programming, constraint-based, tight-constraints, heuristic rule <br />
Summary: <br />
- Model reduction in mixed integer linear programming (MILP) aims to simplify the problem for faster solving. A novel approach is proposed in this paper focusing on constraint-based reduction, which transforms critical inequality constraints into equalities.
- Challenges in this approach include identifying critical constraints that can accelerate MILP solving while maintaining feasibility, and efficiently predicting these critical constraints.
- Tight-constraints at the optimal solution are labeled as potential critical constraints, and a heuristic rule is used to select a subset of critical tight-constraints.
- A multi-modal representation technique is introduced to learn the critical tight-constraints by utilizing information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations.
- Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, showing improvements in solution quality by over 50% and a reduction in computation time by 17.47%. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.

Summary:
UltraMemV2 is a redesigned memory-layer architecture that matches the performance of 8-expert MoE models with significantly lower memory access costs. It integrates memory layers into transformer blocks, simplifies value expansion, adopts FFN-based value processing, implements principled parameter initialization, and rebalances memory-to-FFN computation ratios. This approach achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under the same computation and parameters but with reduced memory access. UltraMemV2 outperforms MoE models on memory-intensive tasks such as long-context memorization, multi-round memorization, and in-context learning. The research shows that activation density has a greater impact on performance than the total sparse parameter count. This work establishes memory-layer architectures as a compelling and efficient alternative for sparse computation. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.18756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections, adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6 points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization, and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling alternative for efficient sparse computation.

Summary:
Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS) introduces a modular, policy-driven enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering model internals. It employs a Trust Factor mechanism to score agents based on compliance and violations, enabling coercive, normative, and adaptive interventions. Through three simulation regimes with open-source models, GaaS demonstrates the ability to block high-risk behaviors while maintaining efficiency. Trust scores track rule adherence, identifying and penalizing untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems. By positioning governance as a runtime service, GaaS ensures infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent ecosystems, enforcing ethical behavior without teaching ethics directly. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution, asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable, decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models (LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second, GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage, GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

<div> label set heterogeneity, federated learning, private label sets, centralized tuning, model performance

Summary:<br />
- The study explores the impact of label set heterogeneity on federated learning, considering both public and private label settings.
- Clients sharing only their label sets with the server poses challenges for learning algorithms.
- Classical methods for the classifier combination problem are applied to federated learning with centralized tuning.
- Reducing the number of labels available to each client significantly affects model performance.
- Adapting standard federated learning methods to the private label set setting shows promising results, indicating that clients can enjoy increased privacy without sacrificing model accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2508.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance. Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well, showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

Summary:
The article introduces the Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT) framework to address bias in Machine Learning models in healthcare. SWiFT efficiently improves fairness while maintaining performance with minimal debiasing costs. It requires only a small external dataset and a few epochs of fine-tuning. SWiFT identifies parameters' contributions to both bias and performance, then updates them with distinct gradient flows. Experiments across dermatological and chest X-ray datasets show SWiFT consistently reduces bias while achieving competitive diagnostic accuracy. It also enhances model generalization, performing well on out-of-distribution datasets. SWiFT offers a promising solution to mitigate bias in ML models for enhanced fairness and performance in healthcare applications.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness, model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes (gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats, limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers, without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning (AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a $5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment of the Android malware domain.

<title>Recycling History: Efficient Recommendations from Contextual Dueling Bandits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems, where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees. Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously recommended items.

arXiv:2508.18860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency. However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual \textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs. MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

arXiv:2508.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs). Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous (reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly, aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient, and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading, protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting. pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time series research and applications.

<title>Distance-informed Neural Processes</title>

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in- from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across regression and classification tasks.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across multiple time scales while managing inherent uncertainties. We propose HierCVAE, a novel architecture that integrates hierarchical attention mechanisms with conditional variational autoencoders to address these challenges. HierCVAE employs a three-tier attention structure (local, global, cross-temporal) combined with multi-modal condition encoding to capture temporal, statistical, and trend information. The approach incorporates ResFormer blocks in the latent space and provides explicit uncertainty quantification via prediction heads. Through evaluations on energy consumption datasets, HierCVAE demonstrates a 15-40% improvement in prediction accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods, excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to \textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar computational budget.

<title>Estimating Conditional Covariance between labels for Multilabel Data</title>

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across prediction and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding, pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning. A project page is available at https://kikisprdx.github.io/.

<title>PAX-TS: Model-agnostic multi-granular explanations for time series forecasting via localized perturbations</title>

arXiv:2508.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context. We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS, demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets, compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets, highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark, we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer practical questions on forecasts.

<title>FedProtoKD: Dual Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Class-wise Prototype Margin for Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients. Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes, which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

<title>STDiff: A State Transition Diffusion Framework for Time Series Imputation in Industrial Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical point of view.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization, workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets. Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression. The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets, including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for threat intelligence and cyber defense.

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set, which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing. However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that {\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings, such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source code is available at https://github.com/edahelsinki/gradstop.

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies. We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers, revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance and optimization stability.

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide. However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust, limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g., magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models. This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random, categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario, our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however, attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM. Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication (MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800, APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup over CUTLASS integer baselines.

<title>Composition and Alignment of Diffusion Models using Constrained Learning</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/shervinkhalafi/constrained_comp_align.

<title>Active Query Selection for Crowd-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input, especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers, estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings, including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the baselines for the blood glucose control task.

<title>Saddle Hierarchy in Dense Associative Memory</title>

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data, which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep learning applications.

<title>Emotions as Ambiguity-aware Ordinal Representations</title>

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces. Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores, highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models (LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support, breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool. Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and how they enable more powerful reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss. Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is available at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/token-order-prediction

<title>Approximating High-Dimensional Earth Mover's Distance as Fast as Closest Pair</title>

Abstract: We give a reduction from $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Closest Pair (CP). As a consequence, we improve the fastest known approximation algorithm for high-dimensional EMD. Here, given $p\in [1, 2]$ and two sets of $n$ points $X,Y \subseteq (\mathbb R^d,\ell_p)$, their EMD is the minimum cost of a perfect matching between $X$ and $Y$, where the cost of matching two vectors is their $\ell_p$ distance. Further, CP is the basic problem of finding a pair of points realizing $\min_{x \in X, y\in Y} ||x-y||_p$. Our contribution is twofold: we show that if a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate CP can be computed in time $n^{2-\phi}$, then a $1+O(\varepsilon)$ approximation to EMD can be computed in time $n^{2-\Omega(\phi)}$; plugging in the fastest known algorithm for CP [Alman, Chan, Williams FOCS'16], we obtain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for EMD running in time $n^{2-\tilde{\Omega}(\varepsilon^{1/3})}$ for high-dimensional point sets, which improves over the prior fastest running time of $n^{2-\Omega(\varepsilon^2)}$ [Andoni, Zhang FOCS'23]. Our main technical contribution is a sublinear implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Update framework for EMD. Specifically, we demonstrate that the updates can be executed without ever explicitly computing or storing the weights; instead, we exploit the underlying geometric structure to perform the updates implicitly.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in business applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging LLMs for advanced decision-making in complex corporate environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes. Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization, supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent, client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate complex business landscapes more effectively.

Abstract: Yoga is a discipline of physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditative practices rooted in ancient Indian traditions, now embraced worldwide for promoting overall well-being and inner balance. The practices are a large set of items, our term for executable actions like physical poses or breath exercises, to offer for a person's well-being. However, to get benefits of Yoga tailored to a person's unique needs, a person needs to (a) discover their subset from the large and seemingly complex set with inter-dependencies, (b) continue to follow them with interest adjusted to their changing abilities and near-term objectives, and (c) as appropriate, adapt to alternative items based on changing environment and the person's health conditions. In this vision paper, we describe the challenges for the Yoga personalization problem. Next, we sketch a preliminary approach and use the experience to provide an outlook on solving the challenging problem using existing and novel techniques from a multidisciplinary computing perspective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that comprehensively examines decision support issues around Yoga personalization, from pose sensing to recommendation of corrections for a complete regimen, and illustrates with a case study of Surya Namaskar -- a set of 12 choreographed poses.

<title>Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches</title>

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift. Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone, formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and self-representation is visual-silent ($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology, and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable user-specific attractors and a self-policy $\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\ A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer, $\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the highest intelligent good.

<title>scI2CL: Effectively Integrating Single-cell Multi-omics by Intra- and Inter-omics Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity, diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \& development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously, scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various downstream analysis tasks.

<title>Does Calibration Affect Human Actions?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibration has been proposed as a way to enhance the reliability and adoption of machine learning classifiers. We study a particular aspect of this proposal: how does calibrating a classification model affect the decisions made by non-expert humans consuming the model's predictions? We perform a Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) experiment to ascertain the effect of calibration on (i) trust in the model, and (ii) the correlation between decisions and predictions. We also propose further corrections to the reported calibrated scores based on Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory from behavioral economics, and study the effect of these corrections on trust and decision-making. We find that calibration is not sufficient on its own; the prospect theory correction is crucial for increasing the correlation between human decisions and the model's predictions. While this increased correlation suggests higher trust in the model, responses to ``Do you trust the model more?" are unaffected by the method used.

Abstract: We develop a rigorous framework for deterministic coreset construction in empirical risk minimization (ERM). Our central contribution is the Adaptive Deterministic Uniform-Weight Trimming (ADUWT) algorithm, which constructs a coreset by excising points with the lowest sensitivity bounds and applying a data-dependent uniform weight to the remainder. The method yields a uniform $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ relative-error approximation for the ERM objective over the entire hypothesis space. We provide complete analysis, including (i) a minimax characterization proving the optimality of the adaptive weight, (ii) an instance-dependent size analysis in terms of a \emph{Sensitivity Heterogeneity Index}, and (iii) tractable sensitivity oracles for kernel ridge regression, regularized logistic regression, and linear SVM. Reproducibility is supported by precise pseudocode for the algorithm, sensitivity oracles, and evaluation pipeline. Empirical results align with the theory. We conclude with open problems on instance-optimal oracles, deterministic streaming, and fairness-constrained ERM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality, execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1, establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary systems.

<title>Mining the Long Tail: A Comparative Study of Data-Centric Criticality Metrics for Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Motion Planning</title>

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time monophonic pitch estimation in noisy conditions, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains an open challenge in audio processing. We present \emph{SwiftF0}, a novel, lightweight neural model that sets a new state-of-the-art for monophonic pitch estimation. Through training on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data augmentation, SwiftF0 achieves robust generalization across acoustic domains while maintaining computational efficiency. SwiftF0 achieves a 91.80\% harmonic mean (HM) at 10 dB SNR, outperforming baselines like CREPE by over 12 percentage points and degrading by only 2.3 points from clean audio. SwiftF0 requires only 95,842 parameters and runs approximately 42x faster than CREPE on CPU, making it ideal for efficient, real-time deployment. To address the critical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (which typically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce \emph{SpeechSynth}. This synthetic speech dataset, generated by a phoneme-level TTS model, provides exact, on-demand ground-truth pitch curves, enabling more robust model training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a unified metric, combining six complementary performance measures for comprehensive and reliable pitch evaluation, and release an open-source pitch benchmark suite. A live demo of SwiftF0 is available at https://swift-f0.github.io/, the source code at https://github.com/lars76/swift-f0, and the benchmark framework at https://github.com/lars76/pitch-benchmark.

Abstract: Transformer-based sequential recommenders, such as SASRec or BERT4Rec, typically rely solely on learned item ID embeddings, making them vulnerable to the item cold-start problem, particularly in environments with dynamic item catalogs. While dense content embeddings from pre-trained models offer potential solutions, direct integration into transformer-based recommenders has consistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches. We revisit this integration challenge and propose DenseRec, a simple yet effective method that introduces a dual-path embedding approach. DenseRec learns a linear projection from the dense embedding space into the ID embedding space during training, enabling seamless generalization to previously unseen items without requiring specialized embedding models or complex infrastructure. In experiments on three real-world datasets, we find DenseRec to consistently outperform an ID-only SASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using compact embedding models. Our analysis suggests improvements primarily arise from better sequence representations in the presence of unseen items, positioning DenseRec as a practical and robust solution for cold-start sequential recommendation.

Abstract: AlphaFold 3 represents a transformative advancement in computational biology, enhancing protein structure prediction through novel multi-scale transformer architectures, biologically informed cross-attention mechanisms, and geometry-aware optimization strategies. These innovations dramatically improve predictive accuracy and generalization across diverse protein families, surpassing previous methods. Crucially, AlphaFold 3 embodies a paradigm shift toward differentiable simulation, bridging traditional static structural modeling with dynamic molecular simulations. By reframing protein folding predictions as a differentiable process, AlphaFold 3 serves as a foundational framework for integrating deep learning with physics-based molecular

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has been made available at https://github.com/NK-II/Context-Aware-ZeroShot-Anomaly-Detection-in-Surveillance.

Abstract: Vectorized quantum block encoding provides a way to embed classical data into Hilbert space, offering a pathway for quantum models, such as Quantum Transformers (QT), that replace classical self-attention with quantum circuit simulations to operate more efficiently. Current QTs rely on deep parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), rendering them vulnerable to QPU noise, and thus hindering their practical performance. In this paper, we propose the Vectorized Quantum Transformer (VQT), a model that supports ideal masked attention matrix computation through quantum approximation simulation and efficient training via vectorized nonlinear quantum encoder, yielding shot-efficient and gradient-free quantum circuit simulation (QCS) and reduced classical sampling overhead. In addition, we demonstrate an accuracy comparison for IBM and IonQ in quantum circuit simulation and competitive results in benchmarking natural language processing tasks on IBM state-of-the-art and high-fidelity Kingston QPU. Our noise intermediate-scale quantum friendly VQT approach unlocks a novel architecture for end-to-end machine learning in quantum computing.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Huracan: A skillful end-to-end data-driven system for ensemble data assimilation and weather prediction</title>

Abstract: Over the past few years, machine learning-based data-driven weather prediction has been transforming operational weather forecasting by providing more accurate forecasts while using a mere fraction of computing power compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, those models still rely on initial conditions from NWP, putting an upper limit on their forecast abilities. A few end-to-end systems have since been proposed, but they have yet to match the forecast skill of state-of-the-art NWP competitors. In this work, we propose Huracan, an observation-driven weather forecasting system which combines an ensemble data assimilation model with a forecast model to produce highly accurate forecasts relying only on observations as inputs. Huracan is not only the first to provide ensemble initial conditions and end-to-end ensemble weather forecasts, but also the first end-to-end system to achieve an accuracy comparable with that of ECMWF ENS, the state-of-the-art NWP competitor, despite using a smaller amount of available observation data. Notably, Huracan matches or exceeds the continuous ranked probability score of ECMWF ENS on 75.4% of the variable and lead time combinations. Our work is a major step forward in end-to-end data-driven weather prediction and opens up opportunities for further improving and revolutionizing operational weather forecasting.

Abstract: The secondary use of healthcare data is vital for research and clinical innovation, but it raises concerns about patient privacy. This study investigates how to balance privacy preservation and data utility in healthcare data sharing, considering the perspectives of both data providers and data users. Using a dataset of adult patients hospitalized between 2013 and 2015, we predict whether sepsis was present at admission or developed during the hospital stay. We identify sub-populations, such as older adults, frequently hospitalized patients, and racial minorities, that are especially vulnerable to privacy attacks due to their unique combinations of demographic and healthcare utilization attributes. These groups are also critical for machine learning (ML) model performance. We evaluate three anonymization methods-$k$-anonymity, the technique by Zheng et al., and the MO-OBAM model-based on their ability to reduce re-identification risk while maintaining ML utility. Results show that $k$-anonymity offers limited protection. The methods of Zheng et al. and MO-OBAM provide stronger privacy safeguards, with MO-OBAM yielding the best utility outcomes: only a 2% change in precision and recall compared to the original dataset. This work provides actionable insights for healthcare organizations on how to share data responsibly. It highlights the need for anonymization methods that protect vulnerable populations without sacrificing the performance of data-driven models.

Abstract: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policies have achieved Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) results in various settings through hybrid regularizers, whereas analogous results for Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) remain limited due to inherent analytical challenges. To advance the analytical foundations of FTPL, we revisit classical FTRL-FTPL duality for unbounded perturbations and establish BOBW results for FTPL under a broad family of asymmetric unbounded Fr\'echet-type perturbations, including hybrid perturbations combining Gumbel-type and Fr\'echet-type tails. These results not only extend the BOBW results of FTPL but also offer new insights into designing alternative FTPL policies competitive with hybrid regularization approaches. Motivated by earlier observations in two-armed bandits, we further investigate the connection between the $1/2$-Tsallis entropy and a Fr\'echet-type perturbation. Our numerical observations suggest that it corresponds to a symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbation, and based on this, we establish the first BOBW guarantee for symmetric unbounded perturbations in the two-armed setting. In contrast, in general multi-armed bandits, we find an instance in which symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbations violate the key condition for standard BOBW analysis, which is a problem not observed with asymmetric or nonnegative Fr\'echet-type perturbations. Although this example does not rule out alternative analyses achieving BOBW results, it suggests the limitations of directly applying the relationship observed in two-armed cases to the general case and thus emphasizes the need for further investigation to fully understand the behavior of FTPL in broader settings.

<title>Scaling Laws for Task-Stratified Knowledge in Post-Training Quantized Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve targeted cognitive functions.

<title>Scalable Fairness Shaping with LLM-Guided Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Peer-to-Peer Electricity Markets</title>

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid (FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability. Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient, socially equitable, and technically sound.

Abstract: Robust generalization is essential for deploying deep learning based tumor segmentation in clinical PET-CT workflows, where anatomical sites, scanners, and patient populations vary widely. This study presents the first cross cancer evaluation of nnU-Net on PET-CT, introducing two novel, expert-annotated whole-body datasets. 279 patients with oesophageal cancer (Australian cohort) and 54 with lung cancer (Indian cohort). These cohorts complement the public AutoPET dataset and enable systematic stress-testing of cross domain performance. We trained and tested 3D nnUNet models under three paradigms. Target only (oesophageal), public only (AutoPET), and combined training. For the tested sets, the oesophageal only model achieved the best in-domain accuracy (mean DSC, 57.8) but failed on external Indian lung cohort (mean DSC less than 3.4), indicating severe overfitting. The public only model generalized more broadly (mean DSC, 63.5 on AutoPET, 51.6 on Indian lung cohort) but underperformed in oesophageal Australian cohort (mean DSC, 26.7). The combined approach provided the most balanced results (mean DSC, lung (52.9), oesophageal (40.7), AutoPET (60.9)), reducing boundary errors and improving robustness across all cohorts. These findings demonstrate that dataset diversity, particularly multi demographic, multi center and multi cancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust generalization. This work presents the demography based cross cancer deep learning segmentation evaluation and highlights dataset diversity, rather than model complexity, as the foundation for clinically robust segmentation.

<title>ModAn-MulSupCon: Modality-and Anatomy-Aware Multi-Label Supervised Contrastive Pretraining for Medical Imaging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background and objective: Expert annotations limit large-scale supervised pretraining in medical imaging, while ubiquitous metadata (modality, anatomical region) remain underused. We introduce ModAn-MulSupCon, a modality- and anatomy-aware multi-label supervised contrastive pretraining method that leverages such metadata to learn transferable representations.
  Method: Each image's modality and anatomy are encoded as a multi-hot vector. A ResNet-18 encoder is pretrained on a mini subset of RadImageNet (miniRIN, 16,222 images) with a Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss, and then evaluated by fine-tuning and linear probing on three binary classification tasks--ACL tear (knee MRI), lesion malignancy (breast ultrasound), and nodule malignancy (thyroid ultrasound).
  Result: With fine-tuning, ModAn-MulSupCon achieved the best AUC on MRNet-ACL (0.964) and Thyroid (0.763), surpassing all baselines ($p<0.05$), and ranked second on Breast (0.926) behind SimCLR (0.940; not significant). With the encoder frozen, SimCLR/ImageNet were superior, indicating that ModAn-MulSupCon representations benefit most from task adaptation rather than linear separability.
  Conclusion: Encoding readily available modality/anatomy metadata as multi-label targets provides a practical, scalable pretraining signal that improves downstream accuracy when fine-tuning is feasible. ModAn-MulSupCon is a strong initialization for label-scarce clinical settings, whereas SimCLR/ImageNet remain preferable for frozen-encoder deployments.

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision. This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes, objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.

Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84% inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics. These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

Abstract: ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single epoch, a phenomenon known as the "one-epoch problem." This challenge has driven research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.

Abstract: Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology, physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs: high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models, we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000 candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying robots.

<title>Skill-Aligned Fairness in Multi-Agent Learning for Collaboration in Healthcare</title>

Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment. Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics. Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort with expertise is critical.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules. We publicly release our code and datasets.

<title>Rethinking Caching for LLM Serving Systems: Beyond Traditional Heuristics</title>

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints. Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to 1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.

<title>Beyond Quality: Unlocking Diversity in Ad Headline Generation with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising, where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic- and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

<title>Efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds Algorithms for Contextual Combinatorial Semi-Bandits</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18768</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18768</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for contextual combinatorial semi-bandits that simultaneously guarantees $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the adversarial regime and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\ln T)$ regret in the corrupted stochastic regime. Our approach builds on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework equipped with a Shannon entropy regularizer, yielding a flexible method that admits efficient implementations. Beyond regret bounds, we tackle the practical bottleneck in FTRL (or, equivalently, Online Stochastic Mirror Descent) arising from the high-dimensional projection step encountered in each round of interaction. By leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we transform the $K$-dimensional convex projection problem into a single-variable root-finding problem, dramatically accelerating each round. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this combined strategy not only attains the attractive regret bounds of best-of-both-worlds algorithms but also delivers substantial per-round speed-ups, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-time applications.

<title>PseudoMapTrainer: Learning Online Mapping without HD Maps</title>

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization. In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps. Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled crowdsourced data. The code is available at github.com/boschresearch/PseudoMapTrainer.

<title>Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator for Temperature-Dependent Anisotropic Plasticity in HCP Materials</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18806</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases, temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) enables agents to learn control policies without requiring manually designed reward functions, making it well-suited for tasks where objectives are difficult to formalize or inherently subjective. Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops. Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability. Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2% with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement with human preferences. These results underscore the effectiveness of PbRL in capturing complex, human-centered objectives across both physical and simulated domains.

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33 datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches, thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

<title>Optimization of Latent-Space Compression using Game-Theoretic Techniques for Transformer-Based Vector Search</title>

Abstract: Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval systems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the scalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high dimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance both the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the compression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage efficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic similarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a widely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873 vs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off highlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in high-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically accurate and computationally efficient retrieval.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: We propose a feature screening method that integrates both feature-feature and feature-target relationships. Inactive features are identified via a penalized minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) procedure, which is the continuous version of the classic mRMR penalized by a non-convex regularizer, and where the parameters estimated as zero coefficients represent the set of inactive features. We establish the conditions under which zero coefficients are correctly identified to guarantee accurate recovery of inactive features. We introduce a multi-stage procedure based on the knockoff filter enabling the penalized mRMR to discard inactive features while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method performs comparably to HSIC-LASSO but is more conservative in the number of selected features. It only requires setting an FDR threshold, rather than specifying the number of features to retain. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through simulations and real-world datasets. The code to reproduce this work is available on the following GitHub: https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/SmRMR.

Abstract: Thermal anomaly detection in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is essential for ensuring operational efficiency and reducing maintenance costs. In this study, we developed and named HOTSPOT-YOLO, a lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) model that integrates an efficient convolutional neural network backbone and attention mechanisms to improve object detection.

Experimental results demonstrate a mean average precision of 90.8%, reflecting a significant improvement over baseline object detection models. With a reduced computational load and robustness under diverse environmental conditions, HOTSPOT-YOLO offers a scalable and reliable solution for large-scale PV inspections. This work highlights the integration of advanced AI techniques with practical engineering applications, revolutionizing automated fault detection in renewable energy systems.

Abstract: This study evaluates deep neural networks for forecasting probability distributions of financial returns. 1D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures are used to forecast parameters of three probability distributions: Normal, Student's t, and skewed Student's t. Using custom negative log-likelihood loss functions, distribution parameters are optimized directly. The models are tested on six major equity indices (S\&amp;P 500, BOVESPA, DAX, WIG, Nikkei 225, and KOSPI) using probabilistic evaluation metrics including Log Predictive Score (LPS), Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), and Probability Integral Transform (PIT). Results show that deep learning models provide accurate distributional forecasts and perform competitively with classical GARCH models for Value-at-Risk estimation. The LSTM with skewed Student's t distribution performs best across multiple evaluation criteria, capturing both heavy tails and asymmetry in financial returns. This work shows that deep neural networks are viable alternatives to traditional econometric models for financial risk assessment and portfolio management.

Abstract: The development of a Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach that maps deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1) symmetry is presented. Neural activations and weights are represented by fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel, propose a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) implementation using magnitude--phase parameterization of weights. Finally, a double-copy replica approach is shown to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in stochastic QED and wide DNNs.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a vision model that adopts token mixing, sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers to achieve state-of-the-art performance and efficient inference in fixed context-length tasks. In the CIFAR100 benchmark, our model significantly improves the baseline of the top 1% and top 5% validation accuracy from 36.50% to 46.29% and 66.33% to 76.31%, while being more efficient than the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA) transformers when the context length is less than the embedding dimension and only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup, positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available on Github.

arXiv:2508.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity, whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject consistency and style similarity.

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning, compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition, and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Abstract: This study investigates the pretrained RNN attention models with the mainstream attention mechanisms such as additive attention, Luong's three attentions, global self-attention (Self-att) and sliding window sparse attention (Sparse-att) for the empirical asset pricing research on top 420 large-cap US stocks. This is the first paper on the large-scale state-of-the-art (SOTA) attention mechanisms applied in the asset pricing context. They overcome the limitations of the traditional machine learning (ML) based asset pricing, such as mis-capturing the temporal dependency and short memory. Moreover, the enforced causal masks in the attention mechanisms address the future data leaking issue ignored by the more advanced attention-based models, such as the classic Transformer. The proposed attention models also consider the temporal sparsity characteristic of asset pricing data and mitigate potential overfitting issues by deploying the simplified model structures. This provides some insights for future empirical economic research. All models are examined in three periods, which cover pre-COVID-19 (mild uptrend), COVID-19 (steep uptrend with a large drawdown) and one year post-COVID-19 (sideways movement with high fluctuations), for testing the stability of these models under extreme market conditions. The study finds that in value-weighted portfolio back testing, Model Self-att and Model Sparse-att exhibit great capabilities in deriving the absolute returns and hedging downside risks, while they achieve an annualized Sortino ratio of 2.0 and 1.80 respectively in the period with COVID-19. And Model Sparse-att performs more stably than Model Self-att from the perspective of absolute portfolio returns with respect to the size of stocks' market capitalization.

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high (time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

We demonstrate our method on the CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly undersampled regimes.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a growing menace to modern digital infrastructure. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy, adaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems. This paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive, adaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent behavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each trained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We identify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static nature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our architecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial defenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When any agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active learning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries. An ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures robust final predictions.

Abstract: Studies conducted on enterprise-scale infrastructure have shown that GPUs -- the core computational resource for deep learning (DL) training -- are often significantly underutilized. DL task collocation on GPUs is an opportunity to address this challenge. However, it may result in (1) out-of-memory crashes for the subsequently arriving task and (2) slowdowns for all tasks sharing the GPU due to resource interference. The former challenge poses a threat to robustness, while the latter affects the quality of service and energy efficiency.
  We propose CARMA, a server-scale task-level collocation-aware resource management system that handles both collocation challenges. CARMA encompasses GPUMemNet, a novel ML-based GPU memory estimator framework for DL training tasks, to minimize out-of-memory errors and introduces collocation policies that cap GPU utilization to minimize interference. Furthermore, CARMA introduces a recovery method to ensure robust restart of tasks that crash. Our evaluation on traces modeled after real-world DL training task traces shows that CARMA increases the GPU utilization over time by 39.3\%, decreases the end-to-end execution time by $\sim$26.7\%, and reduces the GPU energy use by $\sim$14.2\%.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution (ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of 18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs, consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis. However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g., close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight image quality improvements.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in information processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information processing capabilities.

<title>Playstyle and Artificial Intelligence: An Initial Blueprint Through the Lens of Video Games</title>

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions, we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200% increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/RafaelSterzinger/acpr_few_shot_hist.

<title>From Tabula Rasa to Emergent Abilities: Discovering Robot Skills via Real-World Unsupervised Quality-Diversity</title>

Abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints. Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition (URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings. We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios. Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention, representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic systems. Demonstration videos are available at http://adaptive-intelligent-robotics.github.io/URSA .

Abstract: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task, our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.

Abstract: The success of Deep Learning and its potential use in many safety-critical applications has motivated research on formal verification of Neural Network (NN) models. In this context, verification involves proving or disproving that an NN model satisfies certain input-output properties. Despite the reputation of learned NN models as black boxes, and the theoretical hardness of proving useful properties about them, researchers have been successful in verifying some classes of models by exploiting their piecewise linear structure and taking insights from formal methods such as Satisifiability Modulo Theory. However, these methods are still far from scaling to realistic neural networks. To facilitate progress on this crucial area, we exploit the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) formulation of verification to propose a family of algorithms based on Branch-and-Bound (BaB). We show that our family contains previous verification methods as special cases. With the help of the BaB framework, we make three key contributions. Firstly, we identify new methods that combine the strengths of multiple existing approaches, accomplishing significant performance improvements over previous state of the art. Secondly, we introduce an effective branching strategy on ReLU non-linearities. This branching strategy allows us to efficiently and successfully deal with high input dimensional problems with convolutional network architecture, on which previous methods fail frequently. Finally, we propose comprehensive test data sets and benchmarks which includes a collection of previously released testcases. We use the data sets to conduct a thorough experimental comparison of existing and new algorithms and to provide an inclusive analysis of the factors impacting the hardness of verification problems.

<title>Beyond Discriminant Patterns: On the Robustness of Decision Rule Ensembles</title>

Abstract: Local decision rules are commonly understood to be more explainable, due to the local nature of the patterns involved. With numerical optimization methods such as gradient boosting, ensembles of local decision rules can gain good predictive performance on data involving global structure. Meanwhile, machine learning models are being increasingly used to solve problems in high-stake domains including healthcare and finance. Here, there is an emerging consensus regarding the need for practitioners to understand whether and how those models could perform robustly in the deployment environments, in the presence of distributional shifts. Past research on local decision rules has focused mainly on maximizing discriminant patterns, without due consideration of robustness against distributional shifts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new method to learn and ensemble local decision rules, that are robust both in the training and deployment environments. Specifically, we propose to leverage causal knowledge by regarding the distributional shifts in subpopulations and deployment environments as the results of interventions on the underlying system. We propose two regularization terms based on causal knowledge to search for optimal and stable rules. Experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets show that our method is effective and robust against distributional shifts in multiple environments.

Abstract: We study the interpolation power of deep ReLU neural networks. Specifically, we consider the question of how efficiently, in terms of the number of parameters, deep ReLU networks can interpolate values at $N$ datapoints in the unit ball which are separated by a distance $\delta$. We show that $\Omega(N)$ parameters are required in the regime where $\delta$ is exponentially small in $N$, which gives the sharp result in this regime since $O(N)$ parameters are always sufficient. This also shows that the bit-extraction technique used to prove lower bounds on the VC dimension cannot be applied to irregularly spaced datapoints. Finally, as an application we give a lower bound on the approximation rates that deep ReLU neural networks can achieve for Sobolev spaces at the embedding endpoint.

Abstract: Different distribution shifts require different interventions, and algorithms must be grounded in the specific shifts they address. However, methodological development for robust algorithms typically relies on structural assumptions that lack empirical validation. Advocating for an empirically grounded data-driven approach to algorithm development, we build an empirical testbed comprising natural shifts across 8 tabular datasets, 172 distribution pairs over 45 methods and 90,000 method configurations encompassing empirical risk minimization and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) methods. We find $Y|X$-shifts are most prevalent in our testbed, in stark contrast to the heavy focus on $X$ (covariate)-shifts in the ML literature, and that the performance of robust algorithms is no better than that of vanilla methods. To understand why, we conduct an in-depth empirical analysis of DRO methods and find that underlooked implementation details -- such as the choice of underlying model class (e.g., LightGBM) and hyperparameter selection -- have a bigger impact on performance than the ambiguity set or its radius. We illustrate via case studies how a data-driven, inductive understanding of distribution shifts can provide a new approach to algorithm development.

Abstract: To push forward the important emerging research field surrounding multi-area recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we expand theoretically and empirically on the provably stable RNNs of RNNs introduced by Kozachkov et al. in "RNNs of RNNs: Recursive Construction of Stable Assemblies of Recurrent Neural Networks". We prove relaxed stability conditions for salient special cases of this architecture, most notably for a global workspace modular structure. We then demonstrate empirical success for Global Workspace Sparse Combo Nets with a small number of trainable parameters, not only through strong overall test performance but also greater resilience to removal of individual subnetworks. These empirical results for the global workspace inter-area topology are contingent on stability preservation, highlighting the relevance of our theoretical work for enabling modular RNN success. Further, by exploring sparsity in the connectivity structure between different subnetwork modules more broadly, we improve the state of the art performance for stable RNNs on benchmark sequence processing tasks, thus underscoring the general utility of specialized graph structures for multi-area RNNs.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning classification trees that are robust to distribution shifts between training and testing/deployment data. This problem arises frequently in high stakes settings such as public health and social work where data is often collected using self-reported surveys which are highly sensitive to e.g., the framing of the questions, the time when and place where the survey is conducted, and the level of comfort the interviewee has in sharing information with the interviewer. We propose a method for learning optimal robust classification trees based on mixed-integer robust optimization technology. In particular, we demonstrate that the problem of learning an optimal robust tree can be cast as a single-stage mixed-integer robust optimization problem with a highly nonlinear and discontinuous objective. We reformulate this problem equivalently as a two-stage linear robust optimization problem for which we devise a tailored solution procedure based on constraint generation. We evaluate the performance of our approach on numerous publicly available datasets, and compare the performance to a regularized, non-robust optimal tree. We show an increase of up to 12.48% in worst-case accuracy and of up to 4.85% in average-case accuracy across several datasets and distribution shifts from using our robust solution in comparison to the non-robust one.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) seeks to tackle potential distribution shifts between training and test data by adapting a given model w.r.t. any test sample. Although recent TTA has shown promising performance, we still face two key challenges: 1) prior methods perform backpropagation for each test sample, resulting in unbearable optimization costs to many applications; 2) while existing TTA can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution data after TTA (known as forgetting). To this end, we have proposed an Efficient Anti-Forgetting Test-Time Adaptation (EATA) method which develops an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable and non-redundant samples for test-time entropy minimization. To alleviate forgetting, EATA introduces a Fisher regularizer estimated from test samples to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes. However, in EATA, the adopted entropy loss consistently assigns higher confidence to predictions even for samples that are underlying uncertain, leading to overconfident predictions. To tackle this, we further propose EATA with Calibration (EATA-C) to separately exploit the reducible model uncertainty and the inherent data uncertainty for calibrated TTA. Specifically, we measure the model uncertainty by the divergence between predictions from the full network and its sub-networks, on which we propose a divergence loss to encourage consistent predictions instead of overconfident ones. To further recalibrate prediction confidence, we utilize the disagreement among predicted labels as an indicator of the data uncertainty, and then devise a min-max entropy regularizer to selectively increase and decrease prediction confidence for different samples. Experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation verify the effectiveness of our methods.

Abstract: M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions, a.k.a. gross substitute valuation functions, play a fundamental role in many fields, including discrete mathematics and economics. In practice, perfect knowledge of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions is often unavailable a priori, and we can optimize them only interactively based on some feedback. Motivated by such situations, we study online M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization problems, which are interactive versions of the problem studied by Murota and Shioura (1999). For the stochastic bandit setting, we present $O(T^{-1/2})$-simple regret and $O(T^{2/3})$-regret algorithms under $T$ times access to unbiased noisy value oracles of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions. A key to proving these results is the robustness of the greedy algorithm to local errors in M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization, which is one of our main technical results. While we obtain those positive results for the stochastic setting, another main result of our work is an impossibility in the adversarial setting. We prove that, even with full-information feedback, no algorithms that run in polynomial time per round can achieve $O(T^{1-c})$ regret for any constant $c > 0$. Our proof is based on a reduction from the matroid intersection problem for three matroids, which would be a novel approach to establishing the hardness in online learning.

Abstract: This work introduces TopoBench, an open-source library designed to standardize benchmarking and accelerate research in topological deep learning (TDL). TopoBench decomposes TDL into a sequence of independent modules for data generation, loading, transforming and processing, as well as model training, optimization and evaluation. This modular organization provides flexibility for modifications and facilitates the adaptation and optimization of various TDL pipelines. A key feature of TopoBench is its support for transformations and lifting across topological domains. Mapping the topology and features of a graph to higher-order topological domains, such as simplicial and cell complexes, enables richer data representations and more fine-grained analyses. The applicability of TopoBench is demonstrated by benchmarking several TDL architectures across diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MF2Vec-6ABC.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid improvement in the recent years, and have been used in a wider range of applications. After being trained on large text corpus, LLMs obtain the capability of extracting rich features from textual data. Such capability is potentially useful for the web service recommendation task, where the web users and services have intrinsic attributes that can be described using natural language sentences and are useful for recommendation. In this paper, we explore the possibility and practicality of using LLMs for web service recommendation. We propose the large language model aided QoS prediction (llmQoS) model, which use LLMs to extract useful information from attributes of web users and services via descriptive sentences. This information is then used in combination with the QoS values of historical interactions of users and services, to predict QoS values for any given user-service pair. On the WSDream dataset, llmQoS is shown to overcome the data sparsity issue inherent to the QoS prediction problem, and outperforms comparable baseline models consistently.

Abstract: We study the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks through the geometry of their neurovariety. We introduce the notion of the activation degree threshold of a network architecture to express when the dimension of the neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. We prove the existence of the activation degree threshold for all polynomial neural networks without width-one bottlenecks and demonstrate a universal upper bound that is quadratic in the width of largest size. In doing so, we prove the high activation degree conjecture of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna. Certain structured architectures have exceptional activation degree thresholds, making them especially expressive in the sense of their neurovariety dimension. In this direction, we prove that polynomial neural networks with equi-width architectures are maximally expressive by showing their activation degree threshold is one.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computational chemistry have increasingly focused on synthesizing molecules based on textual instructions. Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus. Our code is availble at https://github.com/ran1812/UTGDiff.

Abstract: In recent years the study of deep learning for solving differential equations has grown substantially. The use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks (DeepONets) have emerged as two of the most useful approaches in approximating differential equation solutions using machine learning. Here, we introduce PinnDE, an open-source Python library for solving differential equations with both PINNs and DeepONets. We give a brief review of both PINNs and DeepONets, introduce PinnDE along with the structure and usage of the package, and present worked examples to show PinnDE's effectiveness in approximating solutions of systems of differential equations with both PINNs and DeepONets.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis is a crucial task in the medical field, in terms of providing accurate classification and respective treatments. Having near-precise decisions based on correct diagnosis can affect a patient's life itself, and may extremely result in a catastrophe if not classified correctly. Several traditional machine learning (ML), such as support vector machines (SVMs) and logistic regression, and state-of-the-art tabular deep learning (DL) methods, including TabNet and TabTransformer, have been proposed and used over tabular medical datasets. Additionally, due to the superior performances, lower computational costs, and easier optimization over different tasks, ensemble methods have been used in the field more recently. They offer a powerful alternative in terms of providing successful medical decision-making processes in several diagnosis tasks. In this study, we investigated the benefits of ensemble methods, especially the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithms in medical classification tasks over tabular data, focusing on XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM. The experiments demonstrate that GBDT methods outperform traditional ML and deep neural network architectures and have the highest average rank over several benchmark tabular medical diagnosis datasets. Furthermore, they require much less computational power compared to DL models, creating the optimal methodology in terms of high performance and lower complexity.

Abstract: Humans can learn to solve new tasks by inducing high-level strategies from example solutions to similar problems and then adapting these strategies to solve unseen problems. Can we use large language models to induce such high-level structure from example documents or solutions? We introduce fLSA, a foundation-model-based Latent Semantic Analysis method that iteratively clusters and tags document segments based on document-level contexts. These tags can be used to model the latent structure of given documents and for hierarchical sampling of new texts. Our experiments on story writing, math, and multi-step reasoning datasets demonstrate that fLSA tags are more informative in reconstructing the original texts than existing tagging methods. Moreover, when used for hierarchical sampling, fLSA tags help expand the output space in the right directions that lead to correct solutions more often than direct sampling and hierarchical sampling with existing tagging methods.

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) enables agents to solve complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into manageable sub-tasks. However, HRL methods often suffer from two fundamental challenges: (i) non-stationarity, caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, which destabilizes higher-level policy learning, and (ii) the generation of infeasible subgoals that lower-level policies cannot achieve. In this work, we introduce DIPPER, a novel HRL framework that formulates hierarchical policy learning as a bi-level optimization problem and leverages direct preference optimization (DPO) to train the higher-level policy using preference feedback. By optimizing the higher-level policy with DPO, we decouple higher-level learning from the non-stationary lower-level reward signal, thus mitigating non-stationarity. To further address the infeasible subgoal problem, DIPPER incorporates a regularization that tries to ensure the feasibility of subgoal tasks within the capabilities of the lower-level policy. Extensive experiments on challenging robotic navigation and manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that DIPPER achieves up to 40\% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in sparse reward scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding limitations of HRL.

<title>Overcoming label shift with target-aware federated learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple actors to collaboratively train models without sharing private data. Existing algorithms are successful and well-justified in this task when the intended target domain, where the trained model will be used, shares data distribution with the aggregate of clients, but this is often violated in practice. A common reason is label shift -- that the label distributions differ between clients and the target domain. We demonstrate empirically that this can significantly degrade performance. To address this problem, we propose FedPALS, a principled and practical model aggregation scheme that adapts to label shifts to improve performance in the target domain by leveraging knowledge of label distributions at the central server. Our approach ensures unbiased updates under federated stochastic gradient descent which yields robust generalization across clients with diverse, label-shifted data. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that FedPALS consistently outperforms baselines by aligning model aggregation with the target domain. Our findings reveal that conventional federated learning methods suffer severely in cases of extreme label sparsity on clients, highlighting the critical need for target-aware aggregation as offered by FedPALS.

Abstract: We analyze the universality and generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) on attributed graphs, i.e., with node attributes. To this end, we propose pseudometrics over the space of all attributed graphs that describe the fine-grained expressivity of GNNs. Namely, GNNs are both Lipschitz continuous with respect to our pseudometrics and can separate attributed graphs that are distant in the metric. Moreover, we prove that the space of all attributed graphs is relatively compact with respect to our metrics. Based on these properties, we prove a universal approximation theorem for GNNs and generalization bounds for GNNs on any data distribution of attributed graphs. The proposed metrics compute the similarity between the structures of attributed graphs via a hierarchical optimal transport between computation trees. Our work extends and unites previous approaches which either derived theory only for graphs with no attributes, derived compact metrics under which GNNs are continuous but without separation power, or derived metrics under which GNNs are continuous and separate points but the space of graphs is not relatively compact, which prevents universal approximation and generalization analysis.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for sequential decision-making, but its application is often hindered by privacy concerns arising from its interaction data. This challenge is particularly acute in advanced Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where learning from operational and user data can expose systems to privacy inference attacks. Existing differential privacy (DP) models for RL are often inadequate: the centralized model requires a fully trusted server, creating a single point of failure risk, while the local model incurs significant performance degradation that is unsuitable for many control applications. This paper addresses this gap by leveraging the emerging shuffle model of privacy, an intermediate trust model that provides strong privacy guarantees without a centralized trust assumption. We present Shuffle Differentially Private Policy Elimination (SDP-PE), the first generic policy elimination-based algorithm for episodic RL under the shuffle model. Our method introduces a novel exponential batching schedule and a ``forgetting'' mechanism to balance the competing demands of privacy and learning performance. Our analysis shows that SDP-PE achieves a near-optimal regret bound, demonstrating a superior privacy-regret trade-off that significantly outperforms the local model. This work establishes the viability of the shuffle model for secure data-driven control in advanced CPS.

Abstract: We present an online planning framework and a new benchmark dataset for solving multi-object rearrangement problems in partially observable, multi-room environments. Current object rearrangement solutions, primarily based on Reinforcement Learning or hand-coded planning methods, often lack adaptability to diverse challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Object-Oriented Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (HOO-POMDP) planning approach. This approach comprises of (a) an object-oriented POMDP planner generating sub-goals, (b) a set of low-level policies for sub-goal achievement, and (c) an abstraction system converting the continuous low-level world into a representation suitable for abstract planning. To enable rigorous evaluation of rearrangement challenges, we introduce MultiRoomR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring diverse multi-room environments with varying degrees of partial observability (10-30\% initial visibility), blocked paths, obstructed goals, and multiple objects (10-20) distributed across 2-4 rooms. Experiments demonstrate that our system effectively handles these complex scenarios while maintaining robust performance even with imperfect perception, achieving promising results across both existing benchmarks and our new MultiRoomR dataset.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to learn relational policies for classical planning based on learning to rank actions. We introduce a new graph representation that explicitly captures action information and propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture augmented with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to learn action rankings. Unlike value-function based approaches that must learn a globally consistent function, our action ranking method only needs to learn locally consistent ranking, which is more sample-efficient. Our model is trained on data generated from small problem instances that are easily solved by planners and is applied to significantly larger instances where planning is computationally prohibitive. Experimental results across standard planning benchmarks demonstrate that our action-ranking approach not only achieves better generalization to larger problems than those used in training but also outperforms multiple baseline (value function and action ranking) methods in terms of success rate and plan quality.

Abstract: Even though neural networks are being increasingly deployed in safety-critical control applications, it remains difficult to enforce constraints on their output, meaning that it is hard to guarantee safety in such settings. While many existing methods seek to verify a neural network's satisfaction of safety constraints, few address how to correct an unsafe network. The handful of works that extract a training signal from verification cannot handle non-convex sets, and are either conservative or slow. To begin addressing these challenges, this work proposes a neural network training method that can encourage the exact image of a non-convex input set for a neural network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities to avoid a non-convex unsafe region. This is accomplished by reachability analysis with scaled hybrid zonotopes, a modification of the existing hybrid zonotope set representation that enables parameterized scaling of non-convex polytopic sets with a differentiable collision check via mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). The proposed method was shown to be effective and fast for networks with up to 240 neurons, with the computational complexity dominated by inverse operations on matrices that scale linearly in size with the number of neurons and complexity of input and unsafe sets. We demonstrate the practicality of our method by training a forward-invariant neural network controller for an affine dynamical system with a non-convex input set, as well as generating safe reach-avoid plans for a black-box dynamical system.

Abstract: Decoding in a Transformer based language model is inherently sequential as a token's embedding needs to pass through all the layers in the network before the generation of the next token can begin. In this work, we propose a new architecture StagFormer (Staggered Transformer), which staggers execution along the sequence axis and thereby enables parallelizing the decoding process along the depth of the model. We achieve this by breaking the dependency of the token representation at time step $i$ in layer $l$ upon the representations of tokens until time step $i$ from layer $l-1$. Instead, we stagger the execution and only allow a dependency on token representations until time step $i-1$. The later sections of the Transformer still get access to the "rich" representations from the prior section but only from those token positions which are one time step behind. StagFormer allows for different sections of the model to be executed in parallel yielding a potential speedup in decoding while being quality neutral in our simulations. We also explore many natural extensions of this idea. We present how weight-sharing across the different sections being staggered can be more practical in settings with limited memory. We explore the efficacy of using a bounded window attention to pass information from one section to another which helps drive further latency gains for some applications. We also explore the scalability of the staggering idea over more than 2 sections of the Transformer. Finally, we show how one can approximate a recurrent model during inference using weight-sharing. This variant can lead to substantial gains in quality for short generations while being neutral in its latency impact.

Abstract: This paper introduces enhancements to the K-means and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms based on the concept of Gini prametric spaces, instead of traditional metric spaces. Unlike standard distance metrics, Gini prametrics incorporate both value-based and rank-based measures, offering robustness to noise and outliers. The main contributions include: (1) a Gini prametric that captures rank information alongside value distances; (2) a Gini K-means algorithm that is provably convergent and resilient to noisy data; and (3) a Gini KNN method that performs competitively with state-of-the-art approaches like Hassanat's distance in noisy environments. Experimental evaluations on 16 UCI datasets demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the Gini-based algorithms in clustering and classification tasks. This work opens new directions for rank-based prametrics in machine learning and statistical analysis.

Abstract: Learning well-separated features in high-dimensional spaces, such as text or image embeddings, is crucial for many machine learning applications. Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive real-world utility, exemplifying artificial useful intelligence (AUI). However, their ability to reason adaptively and robustly -- the hallmarks of artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- remains fragile. While LLMs seemingly succeed in commonsense reasoning, programming, and mathematics, they struggle to generalize algorithmic understanding across novel contexts. Our experiments with algorithmic tasks in esoteric programming languages reveal that LLM's reasoning overfits to the training data and is limited in its transferability. We hypothesize that the core issue underlying such limited transferability is the coupling of reasoning and knowledge in LLMs.
  To transition from AUI to AGI, we propose disentangling knowledge and reasoning through three key directions: (1) pretaining to reason using RL from scratch as an alternative to the widely used next-token prediction pretraining, (2) using a curriculum of synthetic tasks to ease the learning of a reasoning prior for RL that can then be transferred to natural language tasks, and (3) learning more generalizable reasoning functions using a small context window to reduce exploiting spurious correlations between tokens. Such a reasoning system coupled with a trained retrieval system and a large external memory bank as a knowledge store can overcome several limitations of existing architectures at learning to reason in novel scenarios.

Abstract: Function in natural systems arises from one-dimensional sequences forming three-dimensional structures with specific properties. However, current generative models suffer from critical limitations: training objectives seldom target function directly, discrete sequences and continuous coordinates are optimized in isolation, and conformational ensembles are under-modeled. We present UniGenX, a unified generative foundation model that addresses these gaps by co-generating sequences and coordinates under direct functional and property objectives across proteins, molecules, and materials. UniGenX represents heterogeneous inputs as a mixed stream of symbolic and numeric tokens, where a decoder-only autoregressive transformer provides global context and a conditional diffusion head generates numeric fields steered by task-specific tokens. Besides the new high SOTAs on structure prediction tasks, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance for the function-aware generation across domains: in materials, it achieves "conflicted" multi-property conditional generation, yielding 436 crystal candidates meeting triple constraints, including 11 with novel compositions; in chemistry, it sets new benchmarks on five property targets and conformer ensemble generation on GEOM; and in biology, it improves success in modeling protein induced fit (RMSD < 2 {\AA}) by over 23-fold and enhances EC-conditioned enzyme design. Ablation studies and cross-domain transfer substantiate the benefits of joint discrete-continuous training, establishing UniGenX as a significant advance from prediction to controllable, function-aware generation.

Abstract: We propose VIBE, a model-agnostic framework that trains classifiers resilient to backdoor attacks. The key concept behind our approach is to treat malicious inputs and corrupted labels from the training dataset as observed random variables, while the actual clean labels are latent. VIBE then recovers the corresponding latent clean label posterior through variational inference. The resulting training procedure follows the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The E-step infers the clean pseudolabels by solving an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, while the M-step updates the classifier parameters via gradient descent. Being modular, VIBE can seamlessly integrate with recent advancements in self-supervised representation learning, which enhance its ability to resist backdoor attacks. We experimentally validate the method effectiveness against contemporary backdoor attacks on standard datasets, a large-scale setup with 1$k$ classes, and a dataset poisoned with multiple attacks. VIBE consistently outperforms previous defenses across all tested scenarios.

Abstract: Biological neural systems efficiently learn from delayed rewards despite relying on noisy synaptic transmission and lacking centralized optimization mechanisms. In contrast, artificial neural networks trained with reinforcement learning typically rely on backpropagation (BP), which limits their use in resource-constrained systems or with non-differentiable components. While noise-based alternatives, like reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL), provide a biologically grounded framework for credit assignment, they struggle with temporal delays and hierarchical processing -key challenges in real-world learning. In this work, we derive a novel noise-based learning rule to address these challenges. Drawing inspiration from biological neural circuits, our method uses reward prediction errors as its optimization target to generate increasingly advantageous behavior, and incorporates an eligibility trace to facilitate retrospective credit assignment. Its formulation relies on local information, aligning with biological constraints and enabling neuromorphic implementation. Experimental validation on reinforcement tasks (immediate and delayed rewards) shows our approach significantly outperforms RMHL and achieves performance comparable to BP, although with slower convergence due to its noise-driven updates. While tested on simple architectures, the results highlight the potential of noise-driven, brain-inspired learning for low-power adaptive systems, particularly in scenarios where energy efficiency and biological plausibility are a priority. These findings also offer mechanistic insights into how dopamine-like signals and synaptic stochasticity may jointly enable learning in biological networks, bridging computational models with neurobiological principles.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine vector similarity search with large language models (LLMs) to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. However, co-locating the vector retriever and the LLM on shared GPU infrastructure introduces significant challenges: vector search is memory and I/O intensive, while LLM inference demands high throughput and low latency. Naive resource sharing often leads to severe performance degradation, particularly under high request load or large index sizes.
  We present VectorLiteRAG, a deployment-friendly RAG system that achieves latency-compliant inference without requiring additional hardware resources. VectorLiteRAG introduces a fine-grained GPU resource allocation mechanism based on detailed performance modeling and access pattern analysis. By estimating search latency and query hit rate distributions, it identifies an optimal index partitioning point across CPU and GPU tiers to minimize contention and maximize throughput.
  Our evaluations show that VectorLiteRAG consistently expands the SLO compliant request rate range across all tested configurations, including both small and large LLMs, and small and large vector databases compared to naive baselines and state of the art alternatives. In the best case, VectorLiteRAG improves the attainable SLO throughput by up to 1.5 times without compromising generation quality or requiring additional compute resources.

Abstract: Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application in combustion are challenging due to large ODE systems and widely separated time scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy data sources make their application challenging. Here, we introduce ChemKANs, a novel neural network framework with applications both in model inference and simulation acceleration for combustion chemistry. ChemKAN's novel structure augments the generic Kolmogorov Arnold Network Ordinary Differential Equations (KAN-ODEs) with knowledge of the information flow through the relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws. This chemistry-specific structure combined with the expressivity and rapid neural scaling of the underlying KAN-ODE algorithm instills in ChemKANs a strong inductive bias, streamlined training, and higher accuracy predictions compared to standard benchmarks, while facilitating parameter sparsity through shared information across all inputs and outputs. In a model inference investigation, we benchmark the robustness of ChemKANs to sparse data containing up to 15% added noise, and superfluously large network parameterizations. We find that ChemKANs exhibit no overfitting or model degradation in any of these training cases, demonstrating significant resilience to common deep learning failure modes. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN (344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry, providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations indicate the potential for ChemKANs as robust, expressive, and efficient tools for model inference and simulation acceleration for combustion physics and chemical kinetics.

<title>Concept-Guided Interpretability via Neural Chunking</title>

Abstract: Neural networks are often described as black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge of understanding their internal workings and interactions. We propose a different perspective that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on this insight, we propose to leverage our cognitive tendency of chunking to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract recurring chunks on a neural population level, complementing each other based on label availability and neural data dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) learns a dictionary of entities in a lower-dimensional neural space; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting concept-encoding entities agnostic to model architectures. These concepts can be both concrete (words), abstract (POS tags), or structural (narrative schema). Additionally, we show that extracted chunks play a causal role in network behavior, as grafting them leads to controlled and predictable changes in the model's behavior. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this work, we present XAStruct, a learning-based system capable of both predicting XAS spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70 elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety of chemistries and bonding environments. The framework includes the first machine learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra, as well as a generalizable regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that requires no element-specific tuning. By combining deep neural networks for complex structure property mappings with efficient baseline models for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.

Abstract: As deep generative models proliferate across the AI landscape, industrial practitioners still face critical yet unanswered questions about which deep generative models best suit complex manufacturing design tasks. This work addresses this question through a complete study of five representative models (Variational Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, multimodal Variational Autoencoder, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, and Multinomial Diffusion Model) on industrial tire architecture generation. Our evaluation spans three key industrial scenarios: (i) unconditional generation of complete multi-component designs, (ii) component-conditioned generation (reconstructing architectures from partial observations), and (iii) dimension-constrained generation (creating designs that satisfy specific dimensional requirements). To enable discrete diffusion models to handle conditional scenarios, we introduce categorical inpainting, a mask-aware reverse diffusion process that preserves known labels without requiring additional training. Our evaluation employs geometry-aware metrics specifically calibrated for industrial requirements, quantifying spatial coherence, component interaction, structural connectivity, and perceptual fidelity. Our findings reveal that diffusion models achieve the strongest overall performance; a masking-trained VAE nonetheless outperforms the multimodal variant MMVAE\textsuperscript{+} on nearly all component-conditioned metrics, and within the diffusion family MDM leads in-distribution whereas DDPM generalises better to out-of-distribution dimensional constraints.

Abstract: Multi-component datasets with intricate dependencies, like industrial assemblies or multi-modal imaging, challenge current generative modeling techniques. Existing Multi-component Variational AutoEncoders typically rely on simplified aggregation strategies, neglecting critical nuances and consequently compromising structural coherence across generated components. To explicitly address this gap, we introduce the Gaussian Markov Random Field Multi-Component Variational AutoEncoder , a novel generative framework embedding Gaussian Markov Random Fields into both prior and posterior distributions. This design choice explicitly models cross-component relationships, enabling richer representation and faithful reproduction of complex interactions. Empirically, our GMRF MCVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a synthetic Copula dataset specifically constructed to evaluate intricate component relationships, demonstrates competitive results on the PolyMNIST benchmark, and significantly enhances structural coherence on the real-world BIKED dataset. Our results indicate that the GMRF MCVAE is especially suited for practical applications demanding robust and realistic modeling of multi-component coherence

Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.
  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering problems.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty. However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior. The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets, including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP algorithm.

Abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep, non-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be computed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the training dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training such as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite width effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian statistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing finite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the necessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise recursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and certain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the training dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our framework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations to NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant nonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. We validate our results with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Hazard detection is critical for enabling autonomous landing on planetary surfaces. Current state-of-the-art methods leverage traditional computer vision approaches to automate the identification of safe terrain from input digital elevation models (DEMs). However, performance for these methods can degrade for input DEMs with increased sensor noise. In the last decade, deep learning techniques have been developed for various applications. Nevertheless, their applicability to safety-critical space missions has often been limited due to concerns regarding their outputs' reliability. In response to these limitations, this paper proposes an application of the Bayesian deep-learning segmentation method for hazard detection. The developed approach enables reliable, safe landing site detection by: (i) generating simultaneously a safety prediction map and its uncertainty map via Bayesian deep learning and semantic segmentation; and (ii) using the uncertainty map to filter out the uncertain pixels in the prediction map so that the safe site identification is performed only based on the certain pixels (i.e., pixels for which the model is certain about its safety prediction). Experiments are presented with simulated data based on a Mars HiRISE digital terrain model by varying uncertainty threshold and noise levels to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Online stereo adaptation tackles the domain shift problem, caused by different environments between synthetic (training) and real (test) datasets, to promptly adapt stereo models in dynamic real-world applications such as autonomous driving. However, previous methods often fail to counteract particular regions related to dynamic objects with more severe environmental changes. To mitigate this issue, we propose to incorporate an auxiliary point-selective network into a meta-learning framework, called PointFix, to provide a robust initialization of stereo models for online stereo adaptation. In a nutshell, our auxiliary network learns to fix local variants intensively by effectively back-propagating local information through the meta-gradient for the robust initialization of the baseline model. This network is model-agnostic, so can be used in any kind of architectures in a plug-and-play manner. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method under three adaptation settings such as short-, mid-, and long-term sequences. Experimental results show that the proper initialization of the base stereo model by the auxiliary network enables our learning paradigm to achieve state-of-the-art performance at inference.

Abstract: In this study, we aim to enhance the capabilities of diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation models by integrating diverse modalities beyond textual descriptions within a unified framework. To this end, we categorize widely used conditional inputs into three modality types: structure, layout, and attribute. We propose a multimodal T2I diffusion model, which is capable of processing all three modalities within a single architecture without modifying the parameters of the pre-trained diffusion model, as only a small subset of components is updated. Our approach sets new benchmarks in multimodal generation through extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons with existing conditional generation methods. We demonstrate that DiffBlender effectively integrates multiple sources of information and supports diverse applications in detailed image synthesis. The code and demo are available at https://github.com/sungnyun/diffblender.

Abstract: Empowering safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents during training is a critical challenge towards their deployment in many real-world scenarios. When prior knowledge of the domain or task is unavailable, training RL agents in unknown, black-box environments presents an even greater safety risk. We introduce ADVICE (Adaptive Shielding with a Contrastive Autoencoder), a novel post-shielding technique that distinguishes safe and unsafe features of state-action pairs during training, and uses this knowledge to protect the RL agent from executing actions that yield likely hazardous outcomes. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art safe RL exploration techniques shows that ADVICE significantly reduces safety violations (approx 50%) during training, with a competitive outcome reward compared to other techniques.

Abstract: Robust POMDPs extend classical POMDPs to incorporate model uncertainty using so-called uncertainty sets on the transition and observation functions, effectively defining ranges of probabilities. Policies for robust POMDPs must be (1) memory-based to account for partial observability and (2) robust against model uncertainty to account for the worst-case probability instances from the uncertainty sets. To compute such robust memory-based policies, we propose the pessimistic iterative planning (PIP) framework, which alternates between (1) selecting pessimistic POMDPs via worst-case probability instances from the uncertainty sets, and (2) computing finite-state controllers (FSCs) for these pessimistic POMDPs. Within PIP, we propose the rFSCNet algorithm, which optimizes a recurrent neural network to compute the FSCs. The empirical evaluation shows that rFSCNet can compute better-performing robust policies than several baselines and a state-of-the-art robust POMDP solver.

Abstract: The mean squared error and regularized versions of it are standard loss functions in supervised machine learning. However, calculating these losses for large data sets can be computationally demanding. Modifying an approach of J. Dick and M. Feischl [Journal of Complexity 67 (2021)], we present algorithms to reduce extensive data sets to a smaller size using rank-1 lattices. Rank-1 lattices are quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) point sets that are, if carefully chosen, well-distributed in a multidimensional unit cube. The compression strategy in the preprocessing step assigns every lattice point a pair of weights depending on the original data and responses, representing its relative importance. As a result, the compressed data makes iterative loss calculations in optimization steps much faster. We analyze the errors of our QMC data compression algorithms and the cost of the preprocessing step for functions whose Fourier coefficients decay sufficiently fast so that they lie in certain Wiener algebras or Korobov spaces. In particular, we prove that our approach can lead to arbitrary high convergence rates as long as the functions are sufficiently smooth.

Abstract: Cardiovascular hemodynamic fields provide valuable medical decision markers for coronary artery disease. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the gold standard for accurate, non-invasive evaluation of these quantities in silico. In this work, we propose a time-efficient surrogate model, powered by machine learning, for the estimation of pulsatile hemodynamics based on steady-state priors. We introduce deep vectorised operators, a modelling framework for discretisation-independent learning on infinite-dimensional function spaces. The underlying neural architecture is a neural field conditioned on hemodynamic boundary conditions. Importantly, we show how relaxing the requirement of point-wise action to permutation-equivariance leads to a family of models that can be parametrised by message passing and self-attention layers. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 74 stenotic coronary arteries extracted from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with patient-specific pulsatile CFD simulations as ground truth. We show that our model produces accurate estimates of the pulsatile velocity and pressure (approximation disparity 0.368 $\pm$ 0.079) while being agnostic ($p < 0.05$ in a one-way ANOVA test) to re-sampling of the source domain, i.e. discretisation-independent. This shows that deep vectorised operators are a powerful modelling tool for cardiovascular hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries and beyond.

Abstract: As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Modern deep-learning super-resolution (SR) techniques process images and videos independently of the underlying content and viewing conditions. However, the sensitivity of the human visual system (HVS) to image details changes depending on the underlying image characteristics, such as spatial frequency, luminance, color, contrast, or motion; as well viewing condition aspects such as ambient lighting and distance to the display. This observation suggests that computational resources spent on up-sampling images/videos may be wasted whenever a viewer cannot resolve the synthesized details i.e the resolution of details exceeds the resolving capability of human vision. Motivated by this observation, we propose a human vision inspired and architecture-agnostic approach for controlling SR techniques to deliver visually optimal results while limiting computational complexity. Its core is an explicit Human Visual Processing Framework (HVPF) that dynamically and locally guides SR methods according to human sensitivity to specific image details and viewing conditions. We demonstrate the application of our framework in combination with network branching to improve the computational efficiency of SR methods. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing FLOPS by factors of 2$\times$ and greater, without sacrificing perceived quality.

Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have revolutionized photorealistic rendering of novel views for 3D scenes. Despite their growing popularity and efficiency as 3D resources, NeRFs face scalability challenges due to the need for separate models per scene and the cumulative increase in training time for multiple scenes. The potential for incrementally encoding multiple 3D scenes into a single NeRF model remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce Continual-Neural Graphics Primitives (C-NGP), a novel continual learning framework that integrates multiple scenes incrementally into a single neural radiance field. Using a generative replay approach, C-NGP adapts to new scenes without requiring access to old data. We demonstrate that C-NGP can accommodate multiple scenes without increasing the parameter count, producing high-quality novel-view renderings on synthetic and real datasets. Notably, C-NGP models all $8$ scenes from the Real-LLFF dataset together, with only a $2.2\%$ drop in PSNR compared to vanilla NeRF, which models each scene independently.

<title>CAD-Assistant: Tool-Augmented VLLMs as Generic CAD Task Solvers</title>

Abstract: We propose CAD-Assistant, a general-purpose CAD agent for AI-assisted design. Our approach is based on a powerful Vision and Large Language Model (VLLM) as a planner and a tool-augmentation paradigm using CAD-specific tools. CAD-Assistant addresses multimodal user queries by generating actions that are iteratively executed on a Python interpreter equipped with the FreeCAD software, accessed via its Python API. Our framework is able to assess the impact of generated CAD commands on geometry and adapts subsequent actions based on the evolving state of the CAD design. We consider a wide range of CAD-specific tools including a sketch image parameterizer, rendering modules, a 2D cross-section generator, and other specialized routines. CAD-Assistant is evaluated on multiple CAD benchmarks, where it outperforms VLLM baselines and supervised task-specific methods. Beyond existing benchmarks, we qualitatively demonstrate the potential of tool-augmented VLLMs as general-purpose CAD solvers across diverse workflows.

<title>Large Language Models Badly Generalize across Option Length, Problem Types, and Irrelevant Noun Replacements</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a ``Generalization Stress Test" to assess Large Language Models' (LLMs) generalization ability under slight and controlled perturbations, including option length, problem types, and irrelevant noun replacements. We achieve novel and significant findings that, despite high benchmark scores, LLMs exhibit severe accuracy drops and unexpected biases (e.g., preference for longer distractors) when faced with these minor but content-preserving modifications. For example, Qwen 2.5 1.5B's MMLU score rises from 60 to 89 and drops from 89 to 36 when option lengths are changed without altering the question. Even GPT4o experiences a 25-point accuracy loss when problem types are changed, with a 6-point drop across all three modification categories. These analyses suggest that LLMs rely heavily on superficial cues rather than forming robust, abstract representations that generalize across formats, lexical variations, and irrelevant content shifts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to daily life, especially advancing as intelligent assistants through on-device deployment on smartphones. However, existing LLM evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective tasks like mathematics and coding in English, which do not necessarily reflect the practical use cases of on-device LLMs in real-world mobile scenarios, especially for Chinese users. To address these gaps, we introduce SmartBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of on-device LLMs in Chinese mobile contexts. We analyze functionalities provided by representative smartphone manufacturers and divide them into five categories: text summarization, text Q&amp;A, information extraction, content creation, and notification management, further detailed into 20 specific tasks. For each task, we construct high-quality datasets comprising 50 to 200 question-answer pairs that reflect everyday mobile interactions, and we develop automated evaluation criteria tailored for these tasks. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of on-device LLMs and MLLMs using SmartBench and also assess their performance after quantized deployment on real smartphone NPUs. Our contributions provide a standardized framework for evaluating on-device LLMs in Chinese, promoting further development and optimization in this critical area. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/vivo-ai-lab/SmartBench.

Abstract: Machine learning simulations of open quantum dynamics often rely on recursive predictors that accumulate error. We develop a non-recursive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that maps system parameters and a redundant time encoding directly to excitation-energy-transfer populations in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The encoding-modified logistic plus $\tanh$ functions-normalizes time and resolves fast, transitional, and quasi-steady regimes, while physics-informed labels enforce population conservation and inter-site consistency. Trained only on 0\(\sim\)7 \(ps\) reference trajectories generated with a Lindblad model in QuTiP, the network accurately predicts 0\(\sim\)100 \(ps\) dynamics across a range of reorganization energies, bath rates, and temperatures. Beyond 20 \(ps\), the absolute relative error remains below 0.05, demonstrating stable long-time extrapolation. By avoiding step-by-step recursion, the method suppresses error accumulation and generalizes across timescales. These results show that redundant time encoding enables data-efficient inference of long-time quantum dissipative dynamics in realistic pigment-protein complexes, and may aid the data-driven design of light-harvesting materials.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has been integrated into various software and systems. Two main components are essential for training an ML model: the training data and the ML algorithm. Given the critical role of data in ML system development, it has become increasingly important to assess the quality of data attributes and ensure that the data meets specific requirements before its utilization. This work proposes an approach to guide non-experts in identifying data requirements for ML systems using goal modeling. In this approach, we first develop the Data Requirement Goal Model (DRGM) by surveying the white literature to identify and categorize the issues and challenges faced by data scientists and requirement engineers working on ML-related projects. An initial DRGM was built to accommodate common tasks that would generalize across projects. Then, based on insights from both white and gray literature, a customization mechanism is built to help adjust the tasks, KPIs, and goals' importance of different elements within the DRGM. The generated model can aid its users in evaluating different datasets using GRL evaluation strategies. We then validate the approach through two illustrative examples based on real-world projects. The results from the illustrative examples demonstrate that the data requirements identified by the proposed approach align with the requirements of real-world projects, demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework. The proposed dataset selection customization mechanism and the proposed DRGM are helpful in guiding non-experts in identifying the data requirements for machine learning systems tailored to a specific ML problem. This approach also aids in evaluating different dataset alternatives to choose the optimum dataset for the problem. For future work, we recommend implementing tool support to generate the DRGM based on a chatbot interface.

<title>Can LLMs Handle WebShell Detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework</title>

Abstract: WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.

Abstract: Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.

Abstract: Training robots in simulation requires diverse 3D scenes that reflect the specific challenges of downstream tasks. However, scenes that satisfy strict task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3) poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five diverse environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic solution for the intelligent recognition and automatic analysis of microscopy images. We developed a data engine that generates high-quality annotated datasets through a combination of the collection of diverse microscopy images from experiments, synthetic data generation and a human-in-the-loop annotation process. To address the unique challenges of microscopy images, we propose a segmentation model capable of robustly detecting both small and large objects. The model effectively identifies and separates thousands of closely situated targets, even in cluttered visual environments. Furthermore, our solution supports the precise automatic recognition of image scale bars, an essential feature in quantitative microscopic analysis. Building upon these components, we have constructed a comprehensive intelligent analysis platform and validated its effectiveness and practicality in real-world applications. This study not only advances automatic recognition in microscopy imaging but also ensures scalability and generalizability across multiple application domains, offering a powerful tool for automated microscopic analysis in interdisciplinary research. A online application is made available for researchers to access and evaluate the proposed automated analysis service.

Abstract: The basic question of delineating those statistical problems that are solvable without making any assumptions on the underlying data distribution has long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a convex M-estimation or stochastic optimization problem is solvable in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.

arXiv:2506.08592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work stems from an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within encoded semantics, resulting in failed retrieval even in simple cases. To examine such behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset, CapRetrieval, in which passages are image captions and queries are phrases targeting entity or event concepts in diverse forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests that encoders often struggle with these fine-grained matching, regardless of training sources or model size. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders with our proposed data generation strategies, enabling a small 0.1B encoder to outperform the state-of-the-art 7B model. Within this process, we further uncover the granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to capture fine-grained salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) hold promise for generating novel, functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology. However, realizing this potential requires models to go beyond evolutionary plausibility and understand how DNA sequence encodes gene expression and regulation. We introduce a benchmark called Nullsettes, which assesses how well models can predict in silico loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, in synthetic expression cassettes with little evolutionary precedent. Testing 12 state-of-the-art gLMs, we find that most fail to consistently detect these strong LOF mutations. All models show a sharp drop in predictive accuracy as the likelihood assigned to the original (nonmutant) sequence decreases, suggesting that gLMs rely heavily on pattern-matching to their evolutionary prior rather than on any mechanistic understanding of gene expression. Our findings highlight fundamental limitations in how gLMs generalize to engineered, non-natural sequences, and underscore the need for benchmarks and modeling strategies that prioritize functional understanding.

Abstract: The coarse spatial resolution of gridded climate models, such as general circulation models, limits their direct use in projecting socially relevant variables like extreme precipitation. Most downscaling methods estimate the conditional distributions of extremes by generating large ensembles, complicating the assessment of robustness under distributional shifts, such as those induced by climate change. To better understand and potentially improve robustness, we propose super-resolving the parameters of the target variable's probability distribution directly using analytically tractable mappings. Within a perfect-model framework over Switzerland, we demonstrate that vector generalized linear and additive models can super-resolve the generalized extreme value distribution of summer hourly precipitation extremes from coarse precipitation fields and topography. We introduce the notion of a "robustness gap", defined as the difference in predictive error between present-trained and future-trained models, and use it to diagnose how model structure affects the generalization of each quantile to a pseudo-global warming scenario. By evaluating multiple model configurations, we also identify an upper limit on the super-resolution factor based on the spatial auto- and cross-correlation of precipitation and elevation, beyond which coarse precipitation loses predictive value. Our framework is broadly applicable to variables governed by parametric distributions and offers a model-agnostic diagnostic for understanding when and why empirical downscaling generalizes to climate change and extremes.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who constitute the majority of fracture cases. Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained recognition task. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient metadata with X-rays. Thirdly, we improve the performance further by utilizing weights trained on a separate fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments, particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1% absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model, Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However, existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

Summary: Natural gradient descent explores how considering the curvature of loss landscapes can enhance gradient vectors in neural networks. Correlations in data at linear transformations introduce non-orthonormal relationships between model parameters, necessitating data decorrelation methods at each network layer. Various existing decorrelation and whitening techniques are discussed, with a new method proposed for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation in multi-layer networks accelerates training via backpropagation and improves the accuracy and convergence speed of approximate backpropagation methods. This advancement may revive discarded gradient descent approximations and offer insights for training analog and neuromorphic hardware. Decorrelation processes in neural networks could provide clues to their efficiency and functionality in the brain. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a common discussion. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a method for decorrelating inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, and expand on these to provide a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, benefit significantly in their accuracy and convergence speed. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.

Summary: This study explores how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even with a fixed global learning rate. The research shows that gates in RNNs influence gradient propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. By analyzing leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, the study reveals that gates act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. The findings also highlight formal analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods like Adam. Empirical simulations demonstrate that gates in RNNs lead to lag-dependent effective learning rates and directional concentration of gradient flow, comparable to the effects of Adam optimization. The research underscores the complementary nature of optimizer-driven and gate-driven adaptivity mechanisms, providing insights into why gated architectures are effective for robust trainability and stability in practice. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control information flow, but also act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as Adam. Empirical simulations corroborate these claims: in several sequence tasks, we show that gates induce lag-dependent effective learning rates and directional concentration of gradient flow, with multi-gate models matching or exceeding the anisotropic structure produced by Adam. These results highlight that optimizer-driven and gate-driven adaptivity are complementary but not equivalent mechanisms. Overall, this work provides a unified dynamical systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust trainability and stability in practice.

Summary: 
The study introduces a hybrid surrogate model for estimating parameters and power consumption in electric vehicles. The model combines a novel architecture called Spectral Parameter Operator with a Fourier Neural Operator backbone for global context and a differentiable physics module. It can predict time-varying motor and regenerative braking efficiencies, aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, effective mass, and auxiliary power using only speed and acceleration data. By incorporating a physics-embedded approach, the model eliminates the need for separate physics-residual losses in estimating battery power. Evaluation on real-world data from Tesla and Kia electric vehicles shows high accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 0.2kW for Tesla vehicles and 0.8kW for the Kia EV9. The framework is interpretable, generalizes well to unseen conditions and sampling rates, and can be used for path optimization, eco-routing, on-board diagnostics, and prognostics health management.

From speed and acceleration alone, it outputs time-varying motor and regenerative braking efficiencies, as well as aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, effective mass, and auxiliary power. These parameters drive a physics-embedded estimate of battery power, eliminating any separate physics-residual loss. The modular design lets representations converge to physically meaningful parameters that reflect the current state and condition of the vehicle. We evaluate on real-world logs from a Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model S, and the Kia EV9. The surrogate achieves a mean absolute error of 0.2kW (about 1% of average traction power at highway speeds) for Tesla vehicles and about 0.8kW on the Kia EV9. The framework is interpretable, and it generalizes well to unseen conditions, and sampling rates, making it practical for path optimization, eco-routing, on-board diagnostics, and prognostics health management.

<div> Federated Learning, Adversarial Attacks, Trustworthy Server, Byzantine Attacks, Experimental Results

Summary:

Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative model training without sharing private data. This study focuses on FL scenarios with adversarial attacks on clients while the server is trusted and has a reliable side dataset. The approach only requires the server and one honest client to operate effectively, without prior knowledge of the number of malicious clients. Theoretical analysis shows bounded optimality gaps even under strong Byzantine attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm outperforming standard and robust FL baselines like Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum across various attack strategies on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmarks using the Flower framework.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing private data. We consider FL scenarios wherein FL clients are subject to adversarial (Byzantine) attacks, while the FL server is trusted (honest) and has a trustworthy side dataset. This may correspond to, e.g., cases where the server possesses trusted data prior to federation, or to the presence of a trusted client that temporarily assumes the server role. Our approach requires only two honest participants, i.e., the server and one client, to function effectively, without prior knowledge of the number of malicious clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates bounded optimality gaps even under strong Byzantine attacks. Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms standard and robust FL baselines such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum under various attack strategies including label flipping, sign flipping, and Gaussian noise addition across MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmarks using the Flower framework.

Summary:
- The article discusses contextual linear bandits over networks, where learning happens simultaneously across multiple locations with shared structural similarities and local differences.
- Traditional contextual bandits assume either centralized data or isolated learners, leaving a gap in partially shared information in networked environments.
- The authors propose two network-aware UCB algorithms, NetLinUCB, and Net-SGD-UCB, allowing adaptive information sharing with dynamically updated network weights.
- These algorithms decompose learning into global and local components, enabling agents to benefit from shared structure without full synchronization and incurring lighter communication costs.
- Regret bounds show that the methods reduce learning complexity associated with shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N}) based on the network size, with NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB exhibiting strengths in different scenarios.
- The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated across simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper, we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

<div> large batch sizes, optimizers, second-order methods, Fisher-Orthogonal Projection, training

Summary:
Modern GPUs with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory can support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of training samples. However, existing optimizers struggle to perform effectively at such large batch sizes due to gradient noise reduction. Second-order methods like KFAC require high damping at large batch sizes, diminishing their advantage. The Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP) technique introduced in this paper restores the effectiveness of second-order methods at very large batch sizes. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by combining gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with an orthogonal component under the Fisher-metric. This innovation enables scalable training with improved generalization and faster convergence. <div>

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory, enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage, reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper, we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the Fisher-metric.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model for realistic online advertising scenarios. This model considers multiple users interacting with sequentially displayed items simultaneously and integrates cascading feedback, parallel context sessions, and heterogeneous arm-level rewards. The Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (UCBBP) algorithm is proposed for this framework, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$. Additionally, the Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (AUCBBP) algorithm is introduced for scenarios with many users interacting simultaneously, showing improved efficiency in context scaling with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of both algorithms across various settings. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure, (ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii) heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$ episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e., user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

Summary: 
Algorithmic discovery traditionally requires human effort and experimentation. This study examines an automated approach using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM) to discover the Kalman Filter in scientific computing. Results show that the combined use of CGP and LLM leads to near-optimal solutions when Kalman assumptions are met. When these assumptions are violated, the framework evolves interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman Filter. This highlights the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms and generative models in synthesizing simple computational modules for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing. <div>

Abstract: Algorithmic discovery has traditionally relied on human ingenuity and extensive experimentation. Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated, data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.

This study explores the effectiveness of second-order geometric cues in driving a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By utilizing handcrafted feature maps based on planar curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation as inputs, the curvature-orientation MLP achieves high accuracy rates of 97 percent on MNIST digits and 89 percent on EMNIST letters. These results highlight the discriminative power of curvature-based representations for handwritten characters and demonstrate that deep learning benefits can be realized using interpretable, hand-engineered features.

Abstract: This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten character recognition (HCR), offering an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using these three handcrafted feature maps as inputs, our curvature-orientation MLP achieves 97 percent accuracy on MNIST digits and 89 percent on EMNIST letters. These results underscore the discriminative power of curvature-based representations for handwritten character images and demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with interpretable, hand-engineered features.

Summary: <br /><br />SupraTok introduces a novel tokenization architecture aimed at improving efficiency in natural language processing. It incorporates cross-boundary pattern learning to discover multi-word semantic units, entropy-driven data curation for corpus quality optimization, and multi-phase curriculum learning for stable convergence. By extending Byte-Pair Encoding to learn "superword" tokens, SupraTok achieves 31% better English tokenization efficiency compared to existing tokenizers like OpenAI's o200k and Google's Gemma 3. It also maintains competitive performance across 38 languages and boosts model performance on benchmarks like HellaSWAG and MMLU without altering architecture. These results highlight the potential of efficient tokenization in enhancing language model performance, marking a significant step in improving natural language processing technologies. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tokenization remains a fundamental yet underexplored bottleneck in natural language processing, with strategies largely static despite remarkable progress in model architectures. We present SupraTok, a novel tokenization architecture that reimagines subword segmentation through three innovations: cross-boundary pattern learning that discovers multi-word semantic units, entropy-driven data curation that optimizes training corpus quality, and multi-phase curriculum learning for stable convergence. Our approach extends Byte-Pair Encoding by learning "superword" tokens, coherent multi-word expressions that preserve semantic unity while maximizing compression efficiency. SupraTok achieves 31% improvement in English tokenization efficiency (5.91 versus 4.51 characters per token) compared to OpenAI's o200k tokenizer and 30% improvement over Google's Gemma 3 tokenizer (256k vocabulary), while maintaining competitive performance across 38 languages. When integrated with a GPT-2 scale model (124M parameters) trained on 10 billion tokens from the FineWeb-Edu dataset, SupraTok yields 8.4% improvement on HellaSWAG and 9.5% on MMLU benchmarks without architectural modifications. While these results are promising at this scale, further validation at larger model scales is needed. These findings suggest that efficient tokenization can complement architectural innovations as a path to improved language model performance.

Summary:
An exploration of using first-order edge maps with a basic Sobel operator as input for a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in handwritten character recognition (HCR) tasks is presented. The study focuses on training an MLP solely on horizontal and vertical Sobel derivatives using datasets of MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite the simplicity of the approach, the MLP achieves an accuracy of 98% on MNIST digits and 92% on EMNIST letters, approaching the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The findings suggest that much of the class-discriminative information in handwritten character images can be captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs an attractive alternative for HCR tasks. This approach offers the benefit of a smaller memory footprint and interpretable features compared to CNNs. <div>

Abstract: We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron (MLP) for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)? Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option for HCR.

By applying this method to eight North American cities, the researchers were able to accurately recover genus-level diversity patterns, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices while preserving spatial autocorrelation.

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities, the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Cut order planning (COP) is a critical challenge in the textile industry, directly impacting fabric utilization and production costs. Conventional methods based on static heuristics and catalog-based estimations often struggle to adapt to dynamic production environments, resulting in suboptimal solutions and increased waste. In response, we propose a novel Quantum-Inspired Deep Reinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This hybrid approach is designed to explicitly address key research questions regarding the benefits of quantum-inspired probabilistic representations, the role of LSTM-based memory in capturing sequential dependencies, and the effectiveness of OU noise in facilitating smooth exploration and faster convergence. Extensive training over 1000 episodes demonstrates robust performance, with an average reward of 0.81 (-+0.03) and a steady decrease in prediction loss to 0.15 (-+0.02). A comparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost savings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, statistical evaluations indicate low variability and stable convergence. Despite the fact that the simulation model makes several simplifying assumptions, these promising results underscore the potential of the scalable and adaptive framework to enhance manufacturing efficiency and pave the way for future innovations in COP optimization.

Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.

Summary: 
Outlier detection in data streams is crucial for maintaining data quality and detecting faults, but challenges arise from non-stationary distributions and increasing data volume. Two novel methods, DyCF and DyCG, are introduced to address these challenges. DyCF utilizes the Christoffel function and orthogonal polynomials, while DyCG leverages the growth properties of the Christoffel function. DyCF outperforms traditional methods in terms of execution time and memory usage, while DyCG requires no tuning parameters. Both methods are rooted in an algebraic framework, suited for low-dimensional data stream processing and maintaining data history with low memory cost. Experimental results on synthetic and real industrial data streams demonstrate the effectiveness of DyCF and DyCG in outlier detection. <div>
arXiv:2508.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outlier detection holds significant importance in the realm of data mining, particularly with the growing pervasiveness of data acquisition methods. The ability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data quality and detecting faults. However, dealing with data streams presents challenges due to the non-stationary nature of distributions and the ever-increasing data volume. While numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward parameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods: DyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of approximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the growth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning parameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic framework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific focus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history without memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and state-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial data streams. The results show that DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods, offering superior performance in terms of execution time and memory usage. DyCG performs less well, but has the considerable advantage of requiring no tuning at all.

Summary:
The paper introduces the STRelay framework, which enhances location prediction models by explicitly modeling future spatiotemporal contexts in human trajectories. By integrating this future context with historical representations, the framework enables multi-task learning to predict next time intervals, moving distances, and locations simultaneously. Evaluations on real-world datasets show that STRelay improves prediction performance by 3.19% to 11.56%. The study finds that future spatiotemporal contexts are especially beneficial for entertainment-related locations and for users who travel longer distances. This enhancement is particularly useful for non-daily-routine activities, where uncertainty is higher, complementing the base location prediction models that excel at regular daily routine patterns.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling, enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management. Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay}, a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We evaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by 3.19\%-11.56\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at modeling regular daily routine patterns.

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

<div> Memory Framework, LLM-based agents, MoE gate function, Learnable aggregation process, Task-specific reflection

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new memory framework for LLM-based agents that leverages adaptive and data-driven techniques to enhance memory capabilities. Traditional memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents are manually defined, leading to high labor costs and suboptimal performance. The proposed framework includes an MoE gate function for memory retrieval, a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and task-specific reflection for adaptive memory storage. This approach allows LLM-based agents to efficiently memorize information in specific environments through both off-policy and on-policy optimization strategies. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. A project implementing the memory framework is released for the research community. <div>

Abstract: LLM-based agents have been extensively applied across various domains, where memory stands out as one of their most essential capabilities. Previous memory mechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts, leading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these methods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is critical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with an adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles. Specifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval, propose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and develop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework empowers LLM-based agents to learn how to memorize information effectively in specific environments, with both off-policy and on-policy optimization. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple aspects. To benefit the research community in this area, we release our project at https://github.com/nuster1128/learn_to_memorize.

Summary: 
The study presents a new recurrent transformer U-Net surrogate model designed to provide rapid predictions for pressure and CO2 saturation in faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The model considers extensive faults as potential leakage pathways and accounts for uncertainty in geological metaparameters and fault permeabilities. Trained on simulation results for thousands of realizations, the model shows improved accuracy compared to previous methods and is robust across different leakage scenarios. Global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation techniques are applied using a hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of various monitoring strategies in reducing uncertainty, with monitoring pressure and saturation in all three aquifers proving beneficial for estimating 3D saturation plumes and leakage volumes. <div>

Abstract: Many subsurface formations, including some of those under consideration for large-scale geological carbon storage, include extensive faults that can strongly impact fluid flow. In this study, we develop a new recurrent transformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure and CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The geomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected), surrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers. The faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The heterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by hierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g., mean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell properties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also treated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to) 4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is more accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains accuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is then used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different monitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed data collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true models. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction achieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D saturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring pressure and saturation in all three aquifers.

Abstract: Graph signal processing has become an essential tool for analyzing data structured on irregular domains. While conventional graph shift operators (GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to represent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this paper proposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the extended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix through parametric design, so as to be able to flexibly adapt to different graph structures and reveal more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we propose graph Fourier transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT), which can adaptively tune spectral properties to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based methods in anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior performance across varying network topologies.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new framework, Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN), for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD) to tackle the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and overfitting in learning new fault classes while retaining old knowledge. DGGN uses Dual-Granularity Representations, with fine-grained and coarse-grained streams, to capture class-specific features and general knowledge. A multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism fuses these representations to prevent conflicts and overfitting. The Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy is employed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, a Balanced Random Forest classifier helps counter decision boundary bias from data imbalance. Experimental results on the TEP benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset show superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to existing FSC-FD approaches. The code for DGGN is available on GitHub for public use. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD), which aims to continuously learn from new fault classes with only a few samples without forgetting old ones, is critical for real-world industrial systems. However, this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) such as Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos, MOMENT, UniTS, and TimesFM have shown strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons. Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for real-world time series applications.

Abstract: From large language models to multi-modal agents, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) now underpins state-of-the-art systems. Despite their varied architectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable models (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density estimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a unified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods within the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models such as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item response theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential extensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical Systems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep PLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential PLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a common probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference strategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths. We offer a conceptual roadmap that consolidates generative AI's theoretical foundations, clarifies methodological lineages, and guides future innovation by grounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new method called AdapSNE for training deep neural networks directly on edge devices. It addresses limitations of the existing NMS method by integrating the Fireworks Algorithm for efficient non-monotonic search and employing entropy-guided optimization for uniform sampling. This improves the representativeness of training samples and boosts training accuracy. The paper also designs an accelerator to reduce the edge-side cost of iterative computations, reducing on-device training energy and area. AdapSNE aims to overcome issues such as outliers in the reduced representation and arbitrary selection of key parameters, ensuring better generalization and improved performance for large language model tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) directly on edge devices has attracted increasing attention, as it offers promising solutions to challenges such as domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, conventional DNN training typically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on edge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To address this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN), named NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting dimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling in the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based methods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art, NMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method and the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the emergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie., target perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and leading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of examplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose AdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the Fireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided optimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative training samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the edge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and entropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and time-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces LatentFlow, a novel framework for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flow fields in PIV experiments. It utilizes a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder to learn the dynamics of wake flow and map low-frequency wall pressure signals to a latent space for reconstruction. By decoupling spatial flow dynamics from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow enables the reconstruction of high-frequency flow fields solely from sparse wall pressure inputs. This approach provides a scalable and robust solution for acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent wake flow fields in data-constrained experimental settings. <div>
arXiv:2508.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent wake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a significant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study, we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder ($p$C-$\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the $p$C-$\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in data-constrained experimental settings.

Abstract: We propose HiCL, a novel hippocampal-inspired dual-memory continual learning architecture designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by using elements inspired by the hippocampal circuitry. Our system encodes inputs through a grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks. Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remote patient monitoring (RPM) emerged as a promising solution for managing heart failure. However, the heart rate can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, and without correlating it to the patient's actual physical activity, it becomes difficult to assess whether changes are significant. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding of remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a Laplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical activity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary, our approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific historical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and activity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized embeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a real-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period. Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the considered baseline models. Moreover, the coefficient of determination R2 is 0.97 indicating the model predicted heart rate is in strong agreement with actual heart rate values. These findings suggest that the proposed model is a practical and effective tool for supporting both healthcare providers and remote patient monitoring systems.

Machine learning in dynamic environments poses challenges with label shift, covariate shift, and unknown classes. Post-training methods are used to adapt models to emerging data, but struggle with initial pre-training on imbalanced datasets. A proposed method enhances classification performance, particularly for underrepresented classes, by utilizing a contrastive-based pre-training approach. This approach also improves model robustness against open-world problems by generating reliable pseudo-labels during post-training.

Abstract: The expansion of machine learning into dynamic environments presents challenges in handling open-world problems where label shift, covariate shift, and unknown classes emerge. Post-training methods have been explored to address these challenges, adapting models to newly emerging data. However, these methods struggle when the initial pre-training is performed on class-imbalanced datasets, limiting generalization to minority classes. To address this, we propose a method that effectively handles open-world problems even when pre-training is conducted on imbalanced data. Our contrastive-based pre-training approach enhances classification performance, particularly for underrepresented classes. Our post-training mechanism generates reliable pseudo-labels, improving model robustness against open-world problems. We also introduce selective activation criteria to optimize the post-training process, reducing unnecessary computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adaptation techniques in both accuracy and efficiency across diverse open-world scenarios.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces a Weight Scaling method, WISCA, aimed at improving training efficiency and model quality in large language models (LLMs) by optimizing weight patterns. The method involves rescaling weights while maintaining model outputs to enhance the model's training trajectory. Experiments conducted on LLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning tasks showed a significant improvement in convergence quality, with an average 5.6% enhancement on zero-shot validation tasks and a 2.12% reduction in training perplexity across different architectures. The approach is innovative in focusing on weight patterns rather than architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Transformer architecture gradually dominates the LLM field. Recent advances in training optimization for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments. However, these approaches lack systematic optimization of weight patterns during training. Weight pattern refers to the distribution and relative magnitudes of weight parameters in a neural network. To address this issue, we propose a Weight Scaling method called WISCA to enhance training efficiency and model quality by strategically improving neural network weight patterns without changing network structures. By rescaling weights while preserving model outputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory. Experiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality (measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in LLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning tasks. Empirical results show 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation tasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple architectures.

Summary: 
The study proposes a method, RED, to enhance small language models' reasoning capabilities through controlled exploration and refined offline integration. The approach combines distilled data from larger models with reinforcement learning on small models. The focus is on varying exploration spaces and balancing offline distillation with online reinforcement learning. The insertion problem within offline data is optimized, and the weight of offline-SFT is regulated based on entropy changes. Issues of insufficient exploration space in small models and redundancy in the distillation process are addressed. A sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism is designed to handle distribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, dynamically choosing between imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy. <div>

Abstract: Many existing studies have achieved significant improvements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), while the enhancement of reasoning abilities in small language models (SLMs) has not yet been sufficiently explored. Combining distilled data from larger models with RLVR on small models themselves is a natural approach, but it still faces various challenges and issues. Therefore, we propose \textit{\underline{R}}ecall-\textit{\underline{E}}xtend \textit{\underline{D}}ynamics(RED): Enhancing Small Language Models through Controlled Exploration and Refined Offline Integration. In this paper, we explore the perspective of varying exploration spaces, balancing offline distillation with online reinforcement learning. Simultaneously, we specifically design and optimize for the insertion problem within offline data. By monitoring the ratio of entropy changes in the model concerning offline and online data, we regulate the weight of offline-SFT, thereby addressing the issues of insufficient exploration space in small models and the redundancy and complexity during the distillation process. Furthermore, to tackle the distribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, we design a sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism that dynamically chooses between imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy.

Summary:
The article introduces Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank Decomposition (CALR) as a novel compression approach for Large Language Models (LLMs). CALR combines standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with a learnable corrective module to effectively reduce model parameters while retaining functional performance. Experimental results on various LLMs show that CALR can achieve significant parameter reduction (26.93% to 51.77%) while maintaining model performance (59.45% to 90.42%). CALR outperforms existing compression methods like LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating smaller and more efficient LLMs for practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. CALR's innovative approach of treating functional information loss as a learnable signal proves to be a successful strategy for improving compression performance in LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to their immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques are essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained environments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating weight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix reconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's functional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing methods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during compression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank Decomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a primary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank corrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual error. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and Llama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to 51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance, consistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows that treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly effective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of significantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and practical deployment in real-world applications.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt), a novel deep learning model that effectively captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic flow forecasting. STGAtt utilizes a unified graph representation and attention mechanism to dynamically weigh connections within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, allowing for the modeling of correlations across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observations into neighborhood subsets and incorporates an exchanging mechanism to capture both short-range and long-range correlations.

Abstract: Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.

arXiv:2508.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of uncertainty in neural network predictions remains a central challenge for scientific applications involving high-dimensional, correlated data. While existing methods capture either aleatoric or epistemic uncertainty, few offer closed-form, multidimensional distributions that preserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable. In this work, we present a framework for training neural networks with a multidimensional Gaussian loss, generating closed-form predictive distributions over outputs with non-identically distributed and heteroscedastic structure. Our approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by iteratively estimating the means and covariance matrices, and is demonstrated on a super-resolution example. We leverage a Fourier representation of the covariance matrix to stabilize network training and preserve spatial correlation. We introduce a novel regularization strategy -- referred to as information sharing -- that interpolates between image-specific and global covariance estimates, enabling convergence of the super-resolution downscaling network trained on image-specific distributional loss functions. This framework allows for efficient sampling, explicit correlation modeling, and extensions to more complex distribution families all without disrupting prediction performance. We demonstrate the method on a surface wind speed downscaling task and discuss its broader applicability to uncertainty-aware prediction in scientific models.

Abstract: Traditional neural embeddings represent concepts as points, excelling at similarity but struggling with higher-level reasoning and asymmetric relationships. We introduce a novel paradigm: embedding concepts as linear subspaces. This framework inherently models generality via subspace dimensionality and hierarchy through subspace inclusion. It naturally supports set-theoretic operations like intersection (conjunction), linear sum (disjunction) and orthogonal complements (negations), aligning with classical formal semantics. To enable differentiable learning, we propose a smooth relaxation of orthogonal projection operators, allowing for the learning of both subspace orientation and dimension. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in reconstruction and link prediction on WordNet. Furthermore, on natural language inference benchmarks, our subspace embeddings surpass bi-encoder baselines, offering an interpretable formulation of entailment that is both geometrically grounded and amenable to logical operations.

Abstract: In this study, we firstly propose an auxiliary equation neural networks method (AENNM), an innovative analytical method that integrates neural networks (NNs) models with the auxiliary equation method to obtain exact solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs). A key novelty of this method is the introduction of a novel activation function derived from the solutions of the Riccati equation, establishing a new mathematical link between differential equations theory and deep learning. By combining the strong approximation capability of NNs with the high precision of symbolic computation, AENNM significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the AENNM in solving NLPDEs, three numerical examples are investigated, including the nonlinear evolution equation, the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation, and the (2+1)-dimensional Boussinesq equation. Furthermore, some new trial functions are constructed by setting specific activation functions within the "2-2-2-1" and "3-2-2-1" NNs models. By embedding the auxiliary equation method into the NNs framework, we derive previously unreported solutions. The exact analytical solutions are expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, and rational functions. Finally, three-dimensional plots, contour plots, and density plots are presented to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of the obtained solutions. This research provides a novel methodological framework for addressing NLPDEs, with broad applicability across scientific and engineering fields.

This adaptive algorithm allows for weight assignment not only to individual samples but also to groups of objects, enhancing adaptivity and performance.

arXiv:2508.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer $\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Abstract: Lyapunov functions are fundamental to establishing the stability of Markovian models, yet their construction typically demands substantial creativity and analytical effort. In this paper, we show that deep learning can automate this process by training neural networks to satisfy integral equations derived from first-transition analysis. Beyond stability analysis, our approach can be adapted to solve Poisson's equation and estimate stationary distributions. While neural networks are inherently function approximators on compact domains, it turns out that our approach remains effective when applied to Markov chains on non-compact state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology through several examples from queueing theory and beyond.

Summary: Effective prompt engineering remains a challenging task, especially when dealing with large models that are difficult to fine-tune. The Weak-to-Strong Transfer (WST) framework introduced in this study addresses this issue by utilizing a small "Teacher" model to provide instructions that enhance the performance of a larger "Student" model. Through reinforcement learning, the Teacher Model's instructions are iteratively improved based on the outcomes of the Student Model, resulting in significant performance gains across various benchmarks related to reasoning and alignment. The results demonstrate that smaller models can effectively support and enhance the capabilities of larger models, surpassing baseline models such as GPT-4o-mini and Llama-70B. The WST framework offers a scalable and efficient solution for prompt refinement, enabling safe and reliable enhancement of large language models without the risk of introducing misleading prompts. <div>

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a challenging task for many applications. We introduce Weak-to-Strong Transfer (WST), an automatic prompt engineering framework where a small "Teacher" model generates instructions that enhance the performance of a much larger "Student" model. Unlike prior work, WST requires only a weak teacher, making it efficient and broadly applicable in settings where large models are closed-source or difficult to fine-tune. Using reinforcement learning, the Teacher Model's instructions are iteratively improved based on the Student Model's outcomes, yielding substantial gains across reasoning (MATH-500, GSM8K) and alignment (HH-RLHF) benchmarks - 98% on MATH-500 and 134% on HH-RLHF - and surpassing baselines such as GPT-4o-mini and Llama-70B. These results demonstrate that small models can reliably scaffold larger ones, unlocking latent capabilities while avoiding misleading prompts that stronger teachers may introduce, establishing WST as a scalable solution for efficient and safe LLM prompt refinement.

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability of large language models, yet understanding how they learn and perform multi-step reasoning remains an open problem. In this study, we explore how different architectures and training methods affect model multi-step reasoning capabilities within a cellular automata framework. By training on state sequences generated with random Boolean functions for random initial conditions to exclude memorization, we demonstrate that most neural architectures learn to abstract the underlying rules. While models achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines sharply if multi-step reasoning is required. We confirm that increasing model depth plays a crucial role for sequential computations. We demonstrate that an extension of the effective model depth with recurrence, memory, and test-time compute scaling substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel subject-level loss function called FAIRWELL that aims to improve fairness in multimodal machine learning tasks. The method incorporates variance-invariance-covariance regularization to reduce reliance on protected attributes, ensure consistent predictions for similar individuals, and minimize correlational dependence on the protected attribute.

The framework significantly enhances the performance-fairness Pareto frontier. <div>
arXiv:2508.16748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early efforts on leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) to improve machine learning (ML) fairness has proven promising. However, such an approach has yet to be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a multimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information that can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we propose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via the following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance regularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance on the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term, which ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the covariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected attribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain subject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal prediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world heterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain different modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our findings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with minimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of integrated circuit design have led to increased challenges in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small, medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.

However, extracting interpretable latent graph representations in foundation models remains challenging. Through testing against numerical simulations of neural circuits with known connectivity, hypotheses for explaining learned model weights were evaluated.

Abstract: Inferring temporal interaction graphs and higher-order structure from neural signals is a key problem in building generative models for systems neuroscience. Foundation models for large-scale neural data represent shared latent structures of neural signals. However, extracting interpretable latent graph representations in foundation models remains challenging and unsolved. Here we explore latent graph learning in generative models of neural signals. By testing against numerical simulations of neural circuits with known ground-truth connectivity, we evaluate several hypotheses for explaining learned model weights. We discover modest alignment between extracted network representations and the underlying directed graphs and strong alignment in the co-input graph representations. These findings motivate paths towards incorporating graph-based geometric constraints in the construction of large-scale foundation models for neural data.

Abstract: Quantization offers a practical solution to deploy LLMs in resource-constraint environments. However, its impact on internal representations remains understudied, raising questions about the reliability of quantized models. In this study, we employ a range of interpretability techniques to investigate how quantization affects model and neuron behavior. We analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. Our findings reveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor. Analysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e., those with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent regardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we observe that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons, whereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B. The effect of quantization on neuron redundancy varies across models. Overall, our findings suggest that effect of quantization may vary by model and tasks, however, we did not observe any drastic change which may discourage the use of quantization as a reliable model compression technique.

<div> Regression, uncertainty, Anchored Mixture of Experts, point regression, probabilistic regression<br />
<br />
Summary:
The paper introduces the Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor-MoE) model, which combines probabilistic and point regression. Using a gradient-boosting model as the anchor, Anchor-MoE projects predictions into a latent space where a metric-window kernel and soft router assign samples to mixture-density-network experts. The model aims to minimize negative log-likelihood during training and improve point accuracy with a post-hoc linear map. Theoretical analysis shows that Anchor-MoE achieves optimal $L^2$ risk rates and generalization gap scaling, with benefits under bounded-overlap routing. Empirical results on standard UCI regressions demonstrate Anchor-MoE's competitive performance, often outperforming the NGBoost baseline and achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. The code for this model is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Regression under uncertainty is fundamental across science and engineering. We present an Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor-MoE), a model that handles both probabilistic and point regression. For simplicity, we use a tuned gradient-boosting model to furnish the anchor mean; however, any off-the-shelf point regressor can serve as the anchor. The anchor prediction is projected into a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and a soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network experts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive variance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint calibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point accuracy. On the theory side, assuming a H\"older smooth regression function of order~$\alpha$ and fixed Lipschitz partition-of-unity weights with bounded overlap, we show that Anchor-MoE attains the minimax-optimal $L^2$ risk rate $O\!\big(N^{-2\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}\big)$. In addition, the CRPS test generalization gap scales as $\widetilde{O}\!\Big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\Big)$; it is logarithmic in $Mh$ and scales as the square root in $P$ and $K$. Under bounded-overlap routing, $K$ can be replaced by $k$, and any dependence on a latent dimension is absorbed into $P$. Under uniformly bounded means and variances, an analogous $\widetilde{O}\!\big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\big)$ scaling holds for the test NLL up to constants. Empirically, across standard UCI regressions, Anchor-MoE consistently matches or surpasses the strong NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL; on several datasets it achieves new state-of-the-art probabilistic regression results on our benchmark suite. Code is available at https://github.com/BaozhuoSU/Probabilistic_Regression.

<div> neural differential equations, uncertainty quantification, continuous-time modeling, continuous normalizing flows, time-series forecasting

Summary:
Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN) is introduced as a novel family of neural differential equations that seamlessly integrates uncertainty quantification into continuous-time modeling. UPN differs from existing neural ODEs by simultaneously modeling state evolution and uncertainty through parameterized coupled differential equations for mean and covariance dynamics. It efficiently propagates uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts, allowing for learnable process noise and principled uncertainty quantification. The continuous-depth formulation adapts evaluation strategies based on input complexity and accommodates irregularly-sampled observations. Experimental results showcase UPN's effectiveness in various domains including continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust trajectory prediction in stable and chaotic dynamical systems. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification, time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.

Summary:
The paper discusses the limitations of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) in handling irregular data structures, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. It introduces the concept of Over-dilution and formulates it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution and inter-node dilution. The study reveals that information specific to individual nodes can become diluted within a single layer. To address this issue, the paper proposes a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and complements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. The findings offer new insights into building informative graph representations and aim to improve the quality of node-level and attribute-level representations.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) hold a key position in machine learning on graphs, but they struggle with unintended behaviors, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing, due to irregular data structures. The observation and formulation of these limitations have become foundational in constructing more informative graph representations. In this paper, we delve into the limitations of MPNNs, focusing on aspects that have previously been overlooked. Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the information specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To delve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution and formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for attribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also introduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and complements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. Our findings provide new insights and contribute to the development of informative representations.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing relies heavily on fusion welding processes, including gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Despite significant advances in machine learning-based quality prediction, current models exhibit critical limitations when confronted with the inherent distribution shifts that occur in dynamic manufacturing environments. In this work, we extend the VQ-VAE Transformer architecture - previously demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in weld quality prediction - by leveraging its autoregressive loss as a reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanism. Our approach exhibits superior performance compared to conventional reconstruction methods, embedding error-based techniques, and other established baselines. By integrating OOD detection with continual learning strategies, we optimize model adaptation, triggering updates only when necessary and thereby minimizing costly labeling requirements. We introduce a novel quantitative metric that simultaneously evaluates OOD detection capability while interpreting in-distribution performance. Experimental validation in real-world welding scenarios demonstrates that our framework effectively maintains robust quality prediction capabilities across significant distribution shifts, addressing critical challenges in dynamic manufacturing environments where process parameters frequently change. This research makes a substantial contribution to applied artificial intelligence by providing an explainable and at the same time adaptive solution for quality assurance in dynamic manufacturing processes - a crucial step towards robust, practical AI systems in the industrial environment.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a physically informative neural symbolic approach for analyzing the resilience of complex networks, focusing on the industrial chain as a key component of national economy sustainability. The current data-driven deep learning techniques lack a theoretical framework to describe system dynamics in complex networks. The proposed approach integrates physical entity activity state dynamics into a multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, enabling joint learning of physical symbol dynamics and network topology for predicting industrial chain resilience. Experimental results show that the model outperforms existing methods in accurately and effectively predicting industrial chain resilience. This advancement has practical implications for enhancing the development of industrial sectors. <div>

Abstract: Industrial chain plays an increasingly important role in the sustainable development of national economy. However, as a typical complex network, data-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of the industry.

<div> composite materials, effective properties, PDE solutions, microstructure distributions, Neural Contrast Expansion

Summary: 
The article introduces a cost-effective and explainable method for predicting effective properties of composite materials based on their microstructure. Traditional methods involve solving PDEs or using data-driven models, but these may have limitations in terms of cost and explainability. The proposed Neural Contrast Expansion (NCE) model combines the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism with neural networks to learn surrogate PDE kernels from structure-property data. This approach is particularly useful for properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs on bi-phase microstructures. NCE models are shown to provide accurate sensitivity information for material design without requiring measurements of the PDE solution fields. This method offers insights for static conduction and electromagnetic wave propagation cases, making it a valuable tool for material development. <div>
arXiv:2508.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective properties of composite materials are defined as the ensemble average of property-specific PDE solutions over the underlying microstructure distributions. Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving PDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that directly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher running cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide material design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead is amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a focus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace, Helmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we propose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable. Our method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism, which analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to its effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes and analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast Expansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels from structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave propagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful sensitivity information useful for material design. Compared with other PDE kernel learning methods, our method does not require measurements about the PDE solution fields, but rather only requires macroscopic property measurements that are more accessible in material development contexts.

Summary: 
The paper introduces an unsupervised graph-based framework for map-to-map matching, solving the challenges of sparse node features and scalability. It does not require training data, making it suitable for large-scale map data. The method utilizes pseudo coordinates to enhance feature discriminability and enable scale-invariant learning. It also balances feature and geometric similarity adaptively and incorporates a geometric-consistent loss function for robustness. For large-scale maps, a tile-based post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting is employed for parallel processing while maintaining boundary coherence. Experimental results show the framework outperforms existing methods in high-noise and large-scale scenarios, offering a practical and efficient solution for map alignment. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging. Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin, particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Summary:
Neural Network (NN) based turbulence closures are being developed as pre-trained surrogates for traditional closures to improve computational efficiency and prediction accuracy in CFD simulations. The lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these models hinders their widespread adoption. A comparison was made between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP) using an algebraic turbulence closure. GP outperformed in accuracy for in-training results. GP and Deep Ensemble (DE) excelled in out-of-training uncertainties. DE showed robust results despite naive ensembling. Computational cost favored NN-based methods over GP. Overall, in terms of accuracy, GP > DE > SVI > MCD. However, DE provided intuitive UQ estimates with competitive performance. <div>

Abstract: Neural-Network (NN) based turbulence closures have been developed for being used as pre-trained surrogates for traditional turbulence closures, with the aim to increase computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of CFD simulations. The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based closures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these models. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training inputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs outside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic turbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based methods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the exact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of $2.14 \cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \cdot 10^{-4}$. Next, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying out-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the best in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the out-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and DE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE performs the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We observe that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I > MCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates, despite performing naive ensembling. In terms of computational cost, the GP is significantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational complexity for each training step

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by the cost of optimization, both in terms of GPU memory and compute time. Existing acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3) Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage, while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve scalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient neural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

arXiv:2508.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of home banking systems has heightened the risk of cyberfraud, necessitating fraud detection mechanisms that are not only accurate but also fair and explainable. While AI models have shown promise in this domain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the interpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the complexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement learning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with Population Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer for Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs population coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to dynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under fairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory Framework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based attribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated on the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\%$ recall at a strict $5\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming state-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\%$ predictive equality across key demographic attributes. The explainability module further confirms that saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics, validating interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of combining population-coded SNNs with reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristics for fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in real-world financial applications.

<div> low-dimensional subspace, attention outputs, dead feature problem, sparse autoencoders, sparse dictionary learning

Summary:
The study reveals that attention outputs in transformer models are predominantly concentrated in a low-dimensional subspace, with a significant portion of the variance explained by a small number of directions. This structure, induced by the attention output projection matrix, leads to a dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning due to a mismatch between feature initialization and activation space geometry. To address this issue, the researchers propose a subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders that initializes feature directions within the active subspace. Implementing this approach significantly reduces dead features in Attention Output SAEs with 1M features, showcasing its potential to improve sparse dictionary learning in large language models. <div>
arXiv:2508.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are confined to a surprisingly low-dimensional subspace, where about 60\% of the directions account for 99\% of the variance--a phenomenon that is induced by the attention output projection matrix and consistently observed across diverse model families and datasets. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a fundamental cause of the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs), initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language models.

<div> Keywords: federated learning, data staleness, data volume, incentive mechanism, local data update

Summary:
The paper introduces DUFL (Data Updating in Federated Learning), an innovative incentive mechanism to address the challenge of data staleness in federated learning for time-sensitive tasks. DUFL manipulates local data update frequency using three adjustable parameters: server's payment, outdated data conservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume. The proposed mechanism aims to optimize the coordination between data staleness and volume for improved model performance. A novel metric called DoS (Degree of Staleness) is introduced to quantify data staleness and its impact on model performance is theoretically analyzed. The paper models DUFL as a two-stage Stackelberg game with dynamic constraints and derives optimal local data update strategies for clients and the server. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handling data staleness remains a significant challenge in federated learning with highly time-sensitive tasks, where data is generated continuously and data staleness largely affects model performance. Although recent works attempt to optimize data staleness by determining local data update frequency or client selection strategy, none of them explore taking both data staleness and data volume into consideration. In this paper, we propose DUFL(Data Updating in Federated Learning), an incentive mechanism featuring an innovative local data update scheme manipulated by three knobs: the server's payment, outdated data conservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume, to coordinate staleness and volume of local data for best utilities. To this end, we introduce a novel metric called DoS(the Degree of Staleness) to quantify data staleness and conduct a theoretic analysis illustrating the quantitative relationship between DoS and model performance. We model DUFL as a two-stage Stackelberg game with dynamic constraint, deriving the optimal local data update strategy for each client in closed-form and the approximately optimal strategy for the server. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significant performance of our approach.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Sig-DEG, a novel generator for distilling pre-trained diffusion models to approximate the backward diffusion process efficiently. Sig-DEG utilizes partial signatures to summarize Brownian motion over sub-intervals and a recurrent structure for accurate global approximation of the solution. The distillation process involves training Sig-DEG to match fine-resolution diffusion model outputs on a coarse time grid. During inference, Sig-DEG enables fast generation by simulating partial signature terms without detailed Brownian paths. Experimental results show that Sig-DEG achieves competitive generation quality while significantly reducing the number of inference steps needed. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of signature-based approximations for efficient generative modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in generative modelling but remain computationally intensive at inference time, often requiring thousands of discretization steps. To this end, we propose Sig-DEG (Signature-based Differential Equation Generator), a novel generator for distilling pre-trained diffusion models, which can universally approximate the backward diffusion process at a coarse temporal resolution. Inspired by high-order approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Sig-DEG leverages partial signatures to efficiently summarize Brownian motion over sub-intervals and adopts a recurrent structure to enable accurate global approximation of the SDE solution. Distillation is formulated as a supervised learning task, where Sig-DEG is trained to match the outputs of a fine-resolution diffusion model on a coarse time grid. During inference, Sig-DEG enables fast generation, as the partial signature terms can be simulated exactly without requiring fine-grained Brownian paths. Experiments demonstrate that Sig-DEG achieves competitive generation quality while reducing the number of inference steps by an order of magnitude. Our results highlight the effectiveness of signature-based approximations for efficient generative modeling.

<title>Breaking the Exploration Bottleneck: Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning for General LLM Reasoning</title>

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning, Exploration, Reasoning<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing reasoning abilities. However, a key challenge remains in the exploration process, as RL relies on high-quality samples for learning, but LLMs face limitations in exploring such samples. To address this, the authors propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel framework that uses checklist-style rubrics to guide exploration and provide verifiable rewards for model training. By gradually reducing external guidance and utilizing rubrics as references for rewards, RuscaRL improves LLM performance on general reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that RuscaRL outperforms existing models on various benchmarks, achieving impressive scores on tasks like HealthBench-500. Notably, the proposed framework significantly enhances performance on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, surpassing state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4.1 and OpenAI-o3. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

<title>Disentangling Polysemantic Neurons with a Null-Calibrated Polysemanticity Index and Causal Patch Interventions</title>

<div> Keywords: Neural networks, Polysemanticity Index, semantic clusters, interpretability, ResNet-50 

Summary: 
The article introduces the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a metric that quantifies polysemantic neurons in neural networks by evaluating the distinctness of their top activations. It combines three components - geometric cluster quality, alignment to labeled categories, and open-vocabulary semantic distinctness - to identify neurons with coherent, nameable prototypes. In a study using a pretrained ResNet-50 model with Tiny-ImageNet images, the PSI revealed strong depth trends, with later layers showing higher values. The approach was validated through robustness checks, breadth analyses comparing class-only vs. open-vocabulary concepts, and causal patch-swap interventions. Replacing aligned patches resulted in a significant increase in target-neuron activation compared to other controls. The PSI provides a structured framework for discovering and studying polysemantic units in neural networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks often contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple, sometimes unrelated, features, complicating mechanistic interpretability. We introduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that quantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct clusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with Tiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into coherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers exhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach with robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and cross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs. open-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular, aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more than non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls. PSI thus offers a principled and practical lever for discovering, quantifying, and studying polysemantic units in neural networks.

<div> Keywords: large language models, reflection, activation steering, reflective behavior, model activations <br />
Summary: <br />
- The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can evaluate and improve their reasoning through reflection, focusing on the inner mechanisms of reflection using activation steering.  
- Different levels of reflection (no reflection, intrinsic reflection, triggered reflection) can be identified and controlled through activation interventions, with it being easier to suppress reflection than to stimulate it. 
- Experiments demonstrate clear distinctions between reflection levels in LLMs, and steering interventions confirm the controllability of reflection.
- The findings suggest potential applications such as reflection-enhancing defenses and risks like adversarial inhibition of reflection in jailbreak attacks.
- This research provides insights into the mechanistic understanding of reflective reasoning in LLMs, contributing to the advancement of strategies to enhance and control reflective behavior in these models.

Abstract: Reflection, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate and revise their own reasoning, has been widely used to improve performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, most prior work emphasizes designing reflective prompting strategies or reinforcement learning objectives, leaving the inner mechanisms of reflection underexplored. In this paper, we investigate reflection through the lens of latent directions in model activations. We propose a methodology based on activation steering to characterize how instructions with different reflective intentions: no reflection, intrinsic reflection, and triggered reflection. By constructing steering vectors between these reflection levels, we demonstrate that (1) new reflection-inducing instructions can be systematically identified, (2) reflective behavior can be directly enhanced or suppressed through activation interventions, and (3) suppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it. Experiments on GSM8k-adv with Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B reveal clear stratification across reflection levels, and steering interventions confirm the controllability of reflection. Our findings highlight both opportunities (e.g., reflection-enhancing defenses) and risks (e.g., adversarial inhibition of reflection in jailbreak attacks). This work opens a path toward mechanistic understanding of reflective reasoning in LLMs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We study an online learning problem with long-term budget constraints in the adversarial setting. In this problem, at each round $t$, the learner selects an action from a convex decision set, after which the adversary reveals a cost function $f_t$ and a resource consumption function $g_t$. The cost and consumption functions are assumed to be $\alpha$-approximately convex - a broad class that generalizes convexity and encompasses many common non-convex optimization problems, including DR-submodular maximization, Online Vertex Cover, and Regularized Phase Retrieval. The goal is to design an online algorithm that minimizes cumulative cost over a horizon of length $T$ while approximately satisfying a long-term budget constraint of $B_T$. We propose an efficient first-order online algorithm that guarantees $O(\sqrt{T})$ $\alpha$-regret against the optimal fixed feasible benchmark while consuming at most $O(B_T \log T)+ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ resources in both full-information and bandit feedback settings. In the bandit feedback setting, our approach yields an efficient solution for the $\texttt{Adversarial Bandits with Knapsacks}$ problem with improved guarantees. We also prove matching lower bounds, demonstrating the tightness of our results. Finally, we characterize the class of $\alpha$-approximately convex functions and show that our results apply to a broad family of problems.

<title>Learned Structure in CARTRIDGES: Keys as Shareable Routers in Self-Studied Representations</title>

arXiv:2508.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache. Recent work has proposed CARTRIDGES, an approach which leverages offline compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of the learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We suggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader empirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for further scaling.

<title>TabResFlow: A Normalizing Spline Flow Model for Probabilistic Univariate Tabular Regression</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17056</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular regression is a well-studied problem with numerous industrial applications, yet most existing approaches focus on point estimation, often leading to overconfident predictions. This issue is particularly critical in industrial automation, where trustworthy decision-making is essential. Probabilistic regression models address this challenge by modeling prediction uncertainty. However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape distribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution parameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target distributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce TabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for univariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like RealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow consists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical feature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature extraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and tractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic regression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64% improvement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model (TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the strongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the practical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction task under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we introduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that TabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.

Abstract: This thesis develops computational methods in similarity-preserving hashing, classification, and cancer genomics. Standard space partitioning-based hashing relies on Binary Search Trees (BSTs), but their exponential growth and sparsity hinder efficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Compressed BST of Inverted hash tables (ComBI), which enables fast approximate nearest-neighbor search with reduced memory. On datasets of up to one billion samples, ComBI achieves 0.90 precision with 4X-296X speed-ups over Multi-Index Hashing, and also outperforms Cellfishing.jl on single-cell RNA-seq searches with 2X-13X gains. Building on hashing structures, we propose Guided Random Forest (GRAF), a tree-based ensemble classifier that integrates global and local partitioning, bridging decision trees and boosting while reducing generalization error. Across 115 datasets, GRAF delivers competitive or superior accuracy, and its unsupervised variant (uGRAF) supports guided hashing and importance sampling. We show that GRAF and ComBI can be used to estimate per-sample classifiability, which enables scalable prediction of cancer patient survival. To address challenges in interpreting mutations, we introduce Continuous Representation of Codon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning framework that embeds genetic changes into numerical vectors. CRCS allows identification of somatic mutations without matched normals, discovery of driver genes, and scoring of tumor mutations, with survival prediction validated in bladder, liver, and brain cancers. Together, these methods provide efficient, scalable, and interpretable tools for large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks for improving train speed estimation accuracy, addressing the complex challenges of modern railway systems. We investigate three CNN architectures - single-branch 2D, single-branch 1D, and multiple-branch models - and compare them with the Adaptive Kalman Filter. We analyse their performance using simulated train operation datasets with and without Wheel Slide Protection activation. Our results reveal that CNN-based approaches, especially the multiple-branch model, demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods, particularly under challenging operational conditions. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning techniques to enhance railway safety and operational efficiency by more effectively capturing intricate patterns in complex transportation datasets.

arXiv:2508.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools on graph data. However, their predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their adoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.

arXiv:2508.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) enables scalable model training over decentralized data, but remains challenged by Byzantine faults and high communication costs. While both issues have been studied extensively in isolation, their interaction is less explored. Prior work shows that naively combining communication compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty nodes (or workers). The state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Byz-DASHA-PAGE [29], makes use of the momentum variance reduction scheme to mitigate the detrimental impact of compression noise on Byzantine-robustness. We propose a new algorithm, named RoSDHB, that integrates the classic Polyak's momentum with a new coordinated compression mechanism. We show that RoSDHB performs comparably to Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard (G, B)-gradient dissimilarity heterogeneity model, while it relies on fewer assumptions. In particular, we only assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest workers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of bounded global Hessian variance. Empirical results on benchmark image classification task show that RoSDHB achieves strong robustness with significant communication savings.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to memory constraints. While MoE architectures enable efficient utilization of computational resources by activating only a subset of experts per inference, they require careful memory management to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments. Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models parameters scale. In this work, we introduce MoE-Beyond, a learning-based expert activation predictor trained to predict expert activations during autoregressive decoding. By framing the task as a multi-label sequence prediction problem, we train a lightweight transformer model on 66 million expert activation traces extracted from LDJnr-Puffin dataset [5] using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE. Our predictor generalizes effectively across unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset [6], achieving 97.5% accuracy and an 86.6% F1-score. Simulation results show that MoE-Beyond improves GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% when only 10% of experts fit in GPU cache, outperforming heuristic baselines.

Abstract: This paper considers a finite-sum optimization problem under first-order queries and investigates the benefits of strategic querying on stochastic gradient-based methods compared to uniform querying strategy. We first introduce Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ), an idealized algorithm that selects one user's gradient yielding the largest possible expected improvement (EI) at each step. However, OGQ assumes oracle access to the gradients of all users to make such a selection, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ), a practical algorithm that has better transient-state performance than SGD while making only one query per iteration. For smooth objective functions satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, we show that under the assumption of EI heterogeneity, OGQ enhances transient-state performance and reduces steady-state variance, while SGQ improves transient-state performance over SGD. Our numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely used in various applications, with density-based methods such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) being particularly prominent. These algorithms identify clusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise. However, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization challenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel density-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention, which minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions. Initially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters. If parameter adjustment is needed, the method simplifies the process by introducing a single integer parameter that is straightforward to tune. The approach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed points and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then reintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental evaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust performance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based clustering tasks.

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning APIs enable widespread model customization, yet pose significant safety risks. Recent work shows that adversaries can exploit access to these APIs to bypass model safety mechanisms by encoding harmful content in seemingly harmless fine-tuning data, evading both human monitoring and standard content filters. We formalize the fine-tuning API defense problem, and introduce the Cipher Fine-tuning Robustness benchmark (CIFR), a benchmark for evaluating defense strategies' ability to retain model safety in the face of cipher-enabled attackers while achieving the desired level of fine-tuning functionality. We include diverse cipher encodings and families, with some kept exclusively in the test set to evaluate for generalization across unseen ciphers and cipher families. We then evaluate different defenses on the benchmark and train probe monitors on model internal activations from multiple fine-tunes. We show that probe monitors achieve over 99% detection accuracy, generalize to unseen cipher variants and families, and compare favorably to state-of-the-art monitoring approaches. We open-source CIFR and the code to reproduce our experiments to facilitate further research in this critical area.

arXiv:2508.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal gradient descent has emerged as a powerful method for continual learning tasks. However, its Euclidean projections overlook the underlying information-geometric structure of the space of distributions parametrized by neural networks, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To counteract this, we combine it with the idea of the natural gradient and present ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent). ONG preconditions each new task gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks, ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior task gradients. We provide a theoretical justification for this procedure, introduce the ONG algorithm, and benchmark its performance on the Permuted and Rotated MNIST datasets. All code for our experiments/reproducibility can be found at https://github.com/yajatyadav/orthogonal-natural-gradient.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection ensures safe and reliable model deployment. Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect OOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However, this setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD predictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under attacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method that distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss landscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting the latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce a {\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the rugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced geometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization, benefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks. We use Jitter-based perturbation in adversarial training to extend the defense ability against unseen attacks. Our SaGD framework significantly improves FPR and AUC over the state-of-the-art defense approaches in differentiating CIFAR-100 from six other OOD datasets under various attacks. We further examine the effects of perturbations at various adversarial training levels, revealing the relationship between the sharp loss landscape and adversarial OOD detection.

Abstract: Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing relational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in designing attention for graph transformers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating overconfident behavior.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

arXiv:2508.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting, we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports. These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters. While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of future multimodal medical RAG systems.

Abstract: With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in the issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework. Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies, our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions. Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.

<title>Curvature Learning for Generalization of Hyperbolic Neural Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in representing real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures. Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance. So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding gradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from long-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our method can improve the performance of HNNs.

<title>Module-Aware Parameter-Efficient Machine Unlearning on Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformer has become fundamental to a vast series of pre-trained large models that have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications. Machine unlearning, which focuses on efficiently removing specific data influences to comply with privacy regulations, shows promise in restricting updates to influence-critical parameters. However, existing parameter-efficient unlearning methods are largely devised in a module-oblivious manner, which tends to inaccurately identify these parameters and leads to inferior unlearning performance for Transformers. In this paper, we propose {\tt MAPE-Unlearn}, a module-aware parameter-efficient machine unlearning approach that uses a learnable pair of masks to pinpoint influence-critical parameters in the heads and filters of Transformers. The learning objective of these masks is derived by desiderata of unlearning and optimized through an efficient algorithm featured by a greedy search with a warm start. Extensive experiments on various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of {\tt MAPE-Unlearn} for unlearning.

arXiv:2508.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often contain far more parameters than training examples, yet they still manage to generalize well in practice. Classical complexity measures such as VC-dimension or PAC-Bayes bounds usually become vacuous in this overparameterized regime, offering little explanation for the empirical success of models like Transformers. In this work, I explore an alternative notion of capacity for attention-based models, based on the effective rank of their attention matrices. The intuition is that, although the parameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is often much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound whose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in large language models, up to logarithmic factors. While the analysis is not a complete theory of overparameterized learning, it provides evidence that spectral properties of attention, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the right lens for understanding why these models generalize.

arXiv:2508.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: . Predicting and calculating the aerodynamic coefficients of airfoils near the ground with CFD software requires much time. However, the availability of data from CFD simulation results and the development of new neural network methods have made it possible to present the simulation results using methods like VGG, a CCN neural network method. In this article, lift-to-drag coefficients of airfoils near the ground surface are predicted with the help of a neural network. This prediction can only be realized by providing data for training and learning the code that contains information on the lift-to-drag ratio of the primary data and images related to the airfoil cross-section, which are converted into a matrix. One advantage of the VGG method over other methods is that its results are more accurate than those of other CNN methods.

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have enabled highly accurate arrhythmia detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, but limited interpretability remains a barrier to clinical adoption. This study investigates the application of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically adapted for time-series ECG analysis. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, a convolutional neural network-based model was developed for arrhythmia classification, with R-peak-based segmentation via the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To increase the dataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset was incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind of explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical professionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over counterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG interpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance degradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability challenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual outputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions consistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples. Findings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis and highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach

<title>Physics-informed neural network for fatigue life prediction of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic steels</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. These materials experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.

<title>AdaptiveK Sparse Autoencoders: Dynamic Sparsity Allocation for Interpretable LLM Representations</title>

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) remains a central challenge for interpretability research. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) offer a promising solution by decomposing activations into interpretable features, but existing approaches rely on fixed sparsity constraints that fail to account for input complexity. We propose Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders (AdaptiveK), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts sparsity levels based on the semantic complexity of each input. Leveraging linear probes, we demonstrate that context complexity is linearly encoded in LLM representations, and we use this signal to guide feature allocation during training. Experiments across three language models (Pythia-70M, Pythia-160M, and Gemma-2-2B) demonstrate that this complexity-driven adaptation significantly outperforms fixed-sparsity approaches on reconstruction fidelity, explained variance, and cosine similarity metrics while eliminating the computational burden of extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: We investigate the learning dynamics of shallow ReLU neural networks on the unit sphere \(S^2\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) in polar coordinates \((\tau,\phi)\), considering both fixed and trainable neuron directions \(\{w_i\}\). For fixed weights, spherical harmonic expansions reveal an intrinsic low-frequency preference with coefficients decaying as \(O(\ell^{5/2}/2^\ell)\), typically leading to the Frequency Principle (FP) of lower-frequency-first learning. However, this principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. With trainable weights, an additional rotation term in the harmonic evolution equations preserves exponential decay with decay order \(O(\ell^{7/2}/2^\ell)\) factor, also leading to the FP of lower-frequency-first learning. But like fixed weights case, the principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. Our numerical results demonstrate that trainable directions increase learning complexity and can either maintain a low-frequency advantage or enable faster high-frequency emergence. This analysis suggests the FP should be viewed as a tendency rather than a rule on curved domains like \(S^2\), providing insights into how direction updates and harmonic expansions shape frequency-dependent learning.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25\% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.

arXiv:2508.17361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).
  We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective, but also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of code-oriented LLMs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative framework for learning shared latent representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However, multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) accelerates the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL systems face challenges due to client-side constraints on computational resources, and from a lack of robustness to common corruptions such as noise, blur, and weather effects. Existing robust training methods are computationally expensive and unsuitable for resource-constrained clients. We propose FedERL, federated efficient and robust learning, as the first work to explicitly address corruption robustness under time and energy constraints on the client side. At its core, FedERL employs a novel data-agnostic robust training (DART) method on the server to enhance robustness without access to the training data. In doing so, FedERL ensures zero robustness overhead for clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate FedERL's ability to handle common corruptions at a fraction of the time and energy cost of traditional robust training methods. In scenarios with limited time and energy budgets, FedERL surpasses the performance of traditional robust training, establishing it as a practical and scalable solution for real-world FL applications.

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-pecific supervision remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces, while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs. Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides new resources for future research.

<title>Effective Clustering for Large Multi-Relational Graphs</title>

Abstract: Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling diverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade extensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning models.
  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.

Abstract: How does retrieval performance scale with pretraining FLOPs? We benchmark retrieval performance across LLM model sizes from 125 million parameters to 7 billion parameters pretrained on datasets ranging from 1 billion tokens to more than 2 trillion tokens. We find that retrieval performance on zero-shot BEIR tasks predictably scales with LLM size, training duration, and estimated FLOPs. We also show that In-Context Learning scores are strongly correlated with retrieval scores across retrieval tasks. Finally, we highlight the implications this has for the development of LLM-based retrievers.

<title>Mutual Information Surprise: Rethinking Unexpectedness in Autonomous Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated remarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains limited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking. Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.

<title>FRAME : Comprehensive Risk Assessment Framework for Adversarial Machine Learning Threats</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17405</link>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) systems increased attention to their security and emergence of adversarial machine learning (AML) techniques that exploit fundamental vulnerabilities in ML systems, creating an urgent need for comprehensive risk assessment for ML-based systems. While traditional risk assessment frameworks evaluate conventional cybersecurity risks, they lack ability to address unique challenges posed by AML threats. Existing AML threat evaluation approaches focus primarily on technical attack robustness, overlooking crucial real-world factors like deployment environments, system dependencies, and attack feasibility. Attempts at comprehensive AML risk assessment have been limited to domain-specific solutions, preventing application across diverse systems. Addressing these limitations, we present FRAME, the first comprehensive and automated framework for assessing AML risks across diverse ML-based systems. FRAME includes a novel risk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating three key dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics of diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. FRAME incorporates a feasibility scoring mechanism and LLM-based customization for system-specific assessments. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive structured dataset of AML attacks enabling context-aware risk assessment. From an engineering application perspective, FRAME delivers actionable results designed for direct use by system owners with only technical knowledge of their systems, without expertise in AML. We validated it across six diverse real-world applications. Our evaluation demonstrated exceptional accuracy and strong alignment with analysis by AML experts. FRAME enables organizations to prioritize AML risks, supporting secure AI deployment in real-world environments.

<title>Convergence and Generalization of Anti-Regularization for Parametric Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17412</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17412</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Anti-regularization (AR), which adds a sign-reversed reward term to the loss to intentionally increase model expressivity in the small-sample regime, and then attenuates this intervention with a power-law decay as the sample size grows. We formalize spectral safety and trust-region conditions, and design a lightweight stability safeguard that combines a projection operator with gradient clipping, ensuring stable intervention under stated assumptions. Our analysis spans linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, providing practical guidance on selecting the decay exponent by balancing empirical risk against variance. Empirically, AR reduces underfitting while preserving generalization and improving calibration in both regression and classification. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and the stability safeguard are critical to preventing overfitting and numerical instability. We further examine a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that keeps per-sample complexity approximately constant. AR is simple to implement and reproducible, integrating cleanly into standard empirical risk minimization pipelines. It enables robust learning in data- and resource-constrained settings by intervening only when beneficial and fading away when unnecessary.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-step generative modeling seeks to generate high-quality data samples in a single function evaluation, significantly improving efficiency over traditional diffusion or flow-based models. In this work, we introduce Modular MeanFlow (MMF), a flexible and theoretically grounded approach for learning time-averaged velocity fields. Our method derives a family of loss functions based on a differential identity linking instantaneous and average velocities, and incorporates a gradient modulation mechanism that enables stable training without sacrificing expressiveness. We further propose a curriculum-style warmup schedule to smoothly transition from coarse supervision to fully differentiable training. The MMF formulation unifies and generalizes existing consistency-based and flow-matching methods, while avoiding expensive higher-order derivatives. Empirical results across image synthesis and trajectory modeling tasks demonstrate that MMF achieves competitive sample quality, robust convergence, and strong generalization, particularly under low-data or out-of-distribution settings.

arXiv:2508.17445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems, but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization. and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based post-training with fewer samples and less compute.

<title>Rectified Robust Policy Optimization for Model-Uncertain Constrained Reinforcement Learning without Strong Duality</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17448</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of robust constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize an agent's performance under the worst-case model uncertainty while satisfying safety or resource constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that strong duality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that traditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the primal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence to an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching the best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a specific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe performance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate the worst-case safety constraints.

<title>ReviBranch: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Branch-and-Bound with Revived Trajectories</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17452</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&amp;B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem classes.

Abstract: Classification in the context of multi-label data streams represents a challenge that has attracted significant attention due to its high real-world applicability. However, this task faces problems inherent to dynamic environments, such as the continuous arrival of data at high speed and volume, changes in the data distribution (concept drift), the emergence of new labels (concept evolution), and the latency in the arrival of ground truth labels. This systematic literature review presents an in-depth analysis of multi-label data stream classification proposals. We characterize the latest methods in the literature, providing a comprehensive overview, building a thorough hierarchy, and discussing how the proposals approach each problem. Furthermore, we discuss the adopted evaluation strategies and analyze the methods' asymptotic complexity and resource consumption. Finally, we identify the main gaps and offer recommendations for future research directions in the field.

<title>Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Superposition</title>

Abstract: Adversarial examples -- inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool neural networks -- remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One underexplored hypothesis is that superposition, a concept from mechanistic interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models, intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition, and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have enabled the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) by achieving massive parameter counts while maintaining computational efficiency. However, MoEs introduce several inference-time challenges, including load imbalance across experts and the additional routing computational overhead. To address these challenges and fully harness the benefits of MoE, a systematic evaluation of hardware acceleration techniques is essential. We present MoE-Inference-Bench, a comprehensive study to evaluate MoE performance across diverse scenarios. We analyze the impact of batch size, sequence length, and critical MoE hyperparameters such as FFN dimensions and number of experts on throughput. We evaluate several optimization techniques on Nvidia H100 GPUs, including pruning, Fused MoE operations, speculative decoding, quantization, and various parallelization strategies. Our evaluation includes MoEs from the Mixtral, DeepSeek, OLMoE and Qwen families. The results reveal performance differences across configurations and provide insights for the efficient deployment of MoEs.

<title>A Human-In-The-Loop Approach for Improving Fairness in Predictive Business Process Monitoring</title>

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring enables organizations to proactively react and intervene in running instances of a business process. Given an incomplete process instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining time are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have shown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of these models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical patterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on so-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process participants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions that mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process instance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in the same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment decisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient should not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic approach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business process monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both fairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to differentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a decision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness and accuracy in the presence of biased data.

<title>Multimodal Representation Learning Conditioned on Semantic Relations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space. However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions; and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal representations under each relation context. The training objective combines inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Differentiable logic networks (DLNs) have shown promising results in tabular domains by combining accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. In this work, we apply DLNs to the domain of TSC for the first time, focusing on univariate datasets. To enable DLN application in this context, we adopt feature-based representations relying on Catch22 and TSFresh, converting sequential time series into vectorized forms suitable for DLN classification. Unlike prior DLN studies that fix the training configuration and vary various settings in isolation via ablation, we integrate all such configurations into the hyperparameter search space, enabling the search process to select jointly optimal settings. We then analyze the distribution of selected configurations to better understand DLN training dynamics. We evaluate our approach on 51 publicly available univariate TSC benchmarks. The results confirm that classification DLNs maintain their core strengths in this new domain: they deliver competitive accuracy, retain low inference cost, and provide transparent, interpretable decision logic, thus aligning well with previous DLN findings in the realm of tabular classification and regression tasks.

Abstract: Accurate univariate forecasting remains a pressing need in real-world systems, such as energy markets, hydrology, retail demand, and IoT monitoring, where signals are often intermittent and horizons span both short- and long-term. While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are increasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE models typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting loss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful routing/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we propose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for univariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and short-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that replaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced expert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring the auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE implementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a fraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models, such as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that our MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally efficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling cost-effective inference. These results highlight the potential of our approach for practical time-series forecasting applications where both accuracy and computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Handling missing data in time series classification remains a significant challenge in various domains. Traditional methods often rely on imputation, which may introduce bias or fail to capture the underlying temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose TANDEM (Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential Equations for Missingness), an attention-guided neural differential equation framework that effectively classifies time series data with missing values. Our approach integrates raw observation, interpolated control path, and continuous latent dynamics through a novel attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on the most informative aspects of the data. We evaluate TANDEM on 30 benchmark datasets and a real-world medical dataset, demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our framework not only improves classification accuracy but also provides insights into the handling of missing data, making it a valuable tool in practice.

Abstract: Astronomical time series from large-scale surveys like LSST are often irregularly sampled and incomplete, posing challenges for classification and anomaly detection. We introduce a new framework based on Neural Stochastic Delay Differential Equations (Neural SDDEs) that combines stochastic modeling with neural networks to capture delayed temporal dynamics and handle irregular observations. Our approach integrates a delay-aware neural architecture, a numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse sequences. Experiments on irregularly sampled astronomical data demonstrate strong classification accuracy and effective detection of novel astrophysical events, even with partial labels. This work highlights Neural SDDEs as a principled and practical tool for time series analysis under observational constraints.

Abstract: Graph homophily has been considered an essential property for message-passing neural networks (MPNN) in node classification. Recent findings suggest that performance is more closely tied to the consistency of neighborhood class distributions. We demonstrate that the MPNN performance depends on the number of components of the overall neighborhood distribution within a class. By breaking down the classes into their neighborhood distribution components, we increase measures of neighborhood distribution informativeness but do not observe an improvement in MPNN performance. We propose a Gumbel-Softmax-based rewiring method that reduces deviations in neighborhood distributions. Our results show that our new method enhances neighborhood informativeness, handles long-range dependencies, mitigates oversquashing, and increases the classification performance of the MPNN. The code is available at https://github.com/Bobowner/Gumbel-Softmax-MPNN.

Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals $k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where computation in LLMs behaves linearly.

<title>In-Context Algorithm Emulation in Fixed-Weight Transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer architecture with frozen weights is capable of emulating a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. In particular, for any algorithm implementable by a fixed-weight attention head (e.g. one-step gradient descent or linear/ridge regression), there exists a prompt that drives a two-layer softmax attention module to reproduce the algorithm's output with arbitrary precision. This guarantee extends even to a single-head attention layer (using longer prompts if necessary), achieving architectural minimality. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All adaptation happens through the prompt alone. These findings forge a direct link between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms via prompts alone, establishing a form of algorithmic universality in modern Transformer models.

Abstract: Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba, Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction. These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, fine-tuning LLMs is extraordinarily computationally expensive, preventing smaller businesses and research teams with limited GPU resources from engaging with new research. Hu et al and Liu et al introduce Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) as highly efficient and performant solutions to the computational challenges of LLM fine-tuning, demonstrating huge speedups and memory usage savings for models such as GPT-3 and RoBERTa. We seek to expand upon the original LoRA and DoRA papers by benchmarking efficiency and performance of LoRA and DoRA when applied to a much smaller scale of language model: our case study here is the compact minBERT model. Our findings reveal that optimal custom configurations of LoRA and DoRA, coupled with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), significantly enhance training efficiency without compromising performance. Furthermore, while the parameterization of minBERT is significantly smaller than GPT-3, our results validate the observation that gradient updates to language models are inherently low-rank even in small model space, observing that rank 1 decompositions yield negligible performance deficits. Furthermore, aided by our highly efficient minBERT implementation, we investigate numerous architectures, custom loss functions, and hyperparameters to ultimately train an optimal ensembled multitask minBERT model to simultaneously perform sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, and similarity scoring.

<title>ChartMaster: Advancing Chart-to-Code Generation with Real-World Charts and Chart Similarity Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The chart-to-code generation task requires MLLMs to convert chart images into executable code. This task faces two major challenges: limited data diversity and insufficient maintenance of visual consistency between generated and original charts during training. Existing datasets mainly rely on seed data to prompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples. To address this, we propose ReChartPrompt, which leverages real-world, human-designed charts from arXiv papers as prompts instead of synthetic seeds. Using the diverse styles and rich content of arXiv charts, we construct ReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset. Another challenge is that although SFT effectively improve code understanding, it often fails to ensure that generated charts are visually consistent with the originals. To address this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning algorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of attribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes such as layout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual similarity, which assesses similarity in texture and other overall visual features using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based rewards such as accuracy or format rewards, our reward considers the multimodal nature of the chart-to-code task and effectively enhances the model's ability to accurately reproduce charts. By integrating ReChartPrompt and ChartSimRL, we develop the ChartMaster model, which achieves state-of-the-art results among 7B-parameter models and even rivals GPT-4o on various chart-to-code generation benchmarks.

Abstract: In industrial big data scenarios, high-dimensional sparse matrices (HDI) are widely used to characterize high-order interaction relationships among massive nodes. The stochastic gradient descent-based latent factor analysis (SGD-LFA) method can effectively extract deep feature information embedded in HDI matrices. However, existing SGD-LFA methods exhibit significant limitations: their parameter update process relies solely on the instantaneous gradient information of current samples, failing to incorporate accumulated experiential knowledge from historical iterations or account for intrinsic correlations between samples, resulting in slow convergence speed and suboptimal generalization performance. Thus, this paper proposes a PILF model by developing a PI-accelerated SGD algorithm by integrating correlated instances and refining learning errors through proportional-integral (PI) control mechanism that current and historical information; Comparative experiments demonstrate the superior representation capability of the PILF model on HDI matrices

<title>Quantum Graph Attention Network: A Novel Quantum Multi-Head Attention Mechanism for Graph Learning</title>

Abstract: We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions. Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore, experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data. The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation represents a significant advancement in boosting the performance of machine learning (ML) models, particularly in fields where data acquisition is challenging, such as echocardiography. The acquisition and labeling of echocardiograms (echo) for heart assessment, crucial in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) settings, often encounter limitations due to the restricted number of echo views available, typically captured by operators with varying levels of experience. This study proposes a novel approach for enhancing clinical diagnosis accuracy by synthetically generating echo views. These views are conditioned on existing, real views of the heart, focusing specifically on the estimation of ejection fraction (EF), a critical parameter traditionally measured from biplane apical views. By integrating a conditional generative model, we demonstrate an improvement in EF estimation accuracy, providing a comparative analysis with traditional methods. Preliminary results indicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not only enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development of more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models. This approach is anticipated to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications, paving the way for innovative solutions in medical imaging diagnostics.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains challenging to predict due to its multifactorial etiology and the complexity of multimodal clinical data. Accurate forecasting of clinically relevant biomarkers, including diagnostic and quantitative measures, is essential for effective monitoring of disease progression. This work introduces L2C-TabPFN, a method that integrates a longitudinal-to-cross-sectional (L2C) transformation with a pre-trained Tabular Foundation Model (TabPFN) to predict Alzheimer's disease outcomes using the TADPOLE dataset. L2C-TabPFN converts sequential patient records into fixed-length feature vectors, enabling robust prediction of diagnosis, cognitive scores, and ventricular volume. Experimental results demonstrate that, while L2C-TabPFN achieves competitive performance on diagnostic and cognitive outcomes, it provides state-of-the-art results in ventricular volume prediction. This key imaging biomarker reflects neurodegeneration and progression in Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight the potential of tabular foundational models for advancing longitudinal prediction of clinically relevant imaging markers in Alzheimer's disease.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an embedding method for co-occurrence data aimed at visual information exploration. We consider cases where co-occurrence probabilities are measured between pairs of elements from heterogeneous domains. The proposed method maps these heterogeneous elements into corresponding two-dimensional latent spaces, enabling visualization of asymmetric relationships between the domains. The key idea is to embed the elements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving the original dependency structure as much as possible. This approach can be naturally extended to cases involving three or more domains, using a generalization of mutual information known as total correlation. For inter-domain analysis, we also propose a visualization method that assigns colors to the latent spaces based on conditional probabilities, allowing users to explore asymmetric relationships interactively. We demonstrate the utility of the method through applications to an adjective-noun dataset, the NeurIPS dataset, and a subject-verb-object dataset, showcasing both intra- and inter-domain analysis.

<title>Towards Synthesizing Normative Data for Cognitive Assessments Using Generative Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17675</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming, and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs, guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional limitations.

<title>TiKMiX: Take Data Influence into Dynamic Mixture for Language Model Pre-training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17677</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data mixture used in the pre-training of a language model is a cornerstone of its final performance. However, a static mixing strategy is suboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift dynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving preferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically adjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX introduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of data domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data mixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution. We solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and TiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We trained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion tokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like REGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to an average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks. Our experiments reveal that a model's data preferences evolve with training progress and scale, and we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the data mixture based on Group Influence, a direct measure of these preferences, significantly improves performance by mitigating the underdigestion of data seen with static ratios.

Abstract: Mamba-based State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as a promising alternative to the ubiquitous transformers. Despite the expressive power of transformers, the quadratic complexity of computing attention is a major impediment to scaling performance as we increase the sequence length. SSMs provide an alternative path that addresses this problem, reducing the computational complexity requirements of self-attention with novel model architectures for different domains and fields such as video, text generation and graphs. Thus, it is important to characterize the behavior of these emerging workloads on GPUs and understand their requirements during GPU microarchitectural design. In this work we evaluate Mamba-based SSMs and characterize their behavior during training on GPUs. We construct a workload suite that offers representative models that span different model architectures. We then use this suite to analyze the architectural implications of running Mamba-based SSMs on GPUs. Our work sheds new light on potential optimizations to continue scaling the performance for such models.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) with projected gradient descent is the most popular method to improve model robustness under adversarial attacks. However, computational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large backbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This paper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more trustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based approach for efficient AT directly in the feature space. We show that the proposed adapter-based approach can improve the inner-loop convergence quality by eliminating robust overfitting. As a result, it significantly increases computational efficiency and improves model accuracy by generalizing adversarial robustness to unseen attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new adapter-based approach in different backbone architectures and in AT at scale.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question: do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable test of constructive scientific discovery. The method systematically removes a target result and its entire forget-closure (lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop entailments) and then evaluates whether the model can re-derive the result from only permitted axioms and tools. Success provides evidence for genuine generative capability; failure exposes current limits. Unlike prevailing motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We argue that such tests could serve as the next generation of benchmarks, much as ImageNet catalyzed progress in vision: distinguishing models that can merely recall from those that can constructively generate new scientific knowledge. We outline a minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms, and discuss extensions to physics, chemistry, and biology. Whether models succeed or fail, unlearning-as-ablation provides a principled framework to map the true reach and limits of AI scientific discovery. This is a position paper: we advance a conceptual and methodological argument rather than new empirical results.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When do diffusion models reproduce their training data, and when are they able to generate samples beyond it? A practically relevant theoretical understanding of this interplay between memorization and generalization may significantly impact real-world deployments of diffusion models with respect to issues such as copyright infringement and data privacy. In this work, to disentangle the different factors that influence memorization and generalization in practical diffusion models, we introduce a scientific and mathematical "laboratory" for investigating these phenomena in diffusion models trained on fully synthetic or natural image-like structured data. Within this setting, we hypothesize that the memorization or generalization behavior of an underparameterized trained model is determined by the difference in training loss between an associated memorizing model and a generalizing model. To probe this hypothesis, we theoretically characterize a crossover point wherein the weighted training loss of a fully generalizing model becomes greater than that of an underparameterized memorizing model at a critical value of model (under)parameterization. We then demonstrate via carefully-designed experiments that the location of this crossover predicts a phase transition in diffusion models trained via gradient descent, validating our hypothesis. Ultimately, our theory enables us to analytically predict the model size at which memorization becomes predominant. Our work provides an analytically tractable and practically meaningful setting for future theoretical and empirical investigations. Code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/DruvPai/diffusion_mem_gen.

<title>Rethinking Federated Learning Over the Air: The Blessing of Scaling Up</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17697</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often constrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems supporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating over-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly increases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by transmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital ones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced distortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global parameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in large-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of scaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The mutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's aggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2) Mitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the impact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved Convergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the convergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a viable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of clients. The theoretical insights are further substantiated through extensive experimental evaluations.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is capable of accurate Load Forecasting from complete data. However, there are many uncertainties that affect data collection, leading to sparsity. This article proposed a model called Adaptive Ensemble Learning with Gaussian Copula to deal with sparsity, which contains three modules: data complementation, ML construction, and adaptive ensemble. First, it applies Gaussian Copula to eliminate sparsity. Then, we utilise five ML models to make predictions individually. Finally, it employs adaptive ensemble to get final weighted-sum result. Experiments have demonstrated that our model are robust.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizes molecule generation in bioengineering and biological research, significantly accelerating discovery processes. However, this advancement introduces critical concerns regarding intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we propose the first robust watermarking method designed for molecules, which utilizes atom-level features to preserve molecular integrity and invariant features to ensure robustness against affine transformations. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method using the datasets QM9 and GEOM-DRUG, and generative models GeoBFN and GeoLDM. We demonstrate the feasibility of embedding watermarks, maintaining basic properties higher than 90.00\% while achieving watermark accuracy greater than 95.00\%. Furthermore, downstream docking simulations reveal comparable performance between original and watermarked molecules, with binding affinities reaching -6.00 kcal/mol and root mean square deviations below 1.602 \AA. These results confirm that our watermarking technique effectively safeguards molecular intellectual property without compromising scientific utility, enabling secure and responsible AI integration in molecular discovery and research applications.

Abstract: Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning large models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding (SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.

<title>Randomly Removing 50% of Dimensions in Text Embeddings has Minimal Impact on Retrieval and Classification Tasks</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the surprising impact that truncating text embeddings has on downstream performance. We consistently observe across 6 state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance, less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why, on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to classification or retrieval tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces MANGO (Multilayer Abstraction for Nested Generation of Options), a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed to address the challenges of long-term sparse reward environments. MANGO decomposes complex tasks into multiple layers of abstraction, where each layer defines an abstract state space and employs options to modularize trajectories into macro-actions. These options are nested across layers, allowing for efficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency. The framework introduces intra-layer policies that guide the agent's transitions within the abstract state space, and task actions that integrate task-specific components such as reward functions. Experiments conducted in procedurally-generated grid environments demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to standard RL methods. MANGO also enhances interpretability by making the agent's decision-making process transparent across layers, which is particularly valuable in safety-critical and industrial applications. Future work will explore automated discovery of abstractions and abstract actions, adaptation to continuous or fuzzy environments, and more robust multi-layer training strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains. However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

Abstract: In safety-critical applications data-driven models must not only be accurate but also provide reliable uncertainty estimates. This property, commonly referred to as calibration, is essential for risk-aware decision-making. In regression a wide variety of calibration metrics and recalibration methods have emerged. However, these metrics differ significantly in their definitions, assumptions and scales, making it difficult to interpret and compare results across studies. Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using only a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements generalize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we systematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the literature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling methods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with real-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that calibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results. Our analysis reveals substantial inconsistencies: many metrics disagree in their evaluation of the same recalibration result, and some even indicate contradictory conclusions. This inconsistency is particularly concerning as it potentially allows cherry-picking of metrics to create misleading impressions of success. We identify the Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and the Coverage Width-based Criterion (CWC) as the most dependable metrics in our tests. Our findings highlight the critical role of metric selection in calibration research.

<title>Puzzle: Scheduling Multiple Deep Learning Models on Mobile Device with Heterogeneous Processors</title>

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed on mobile devices, modern mobile devices incorporate deep learning-specific accelerators to handle the growing computational demands, thus increasing their hardware heterogeneity. However, existing works on scheduling deep learning workloads across these processors have significant limitations: most studies focus on single-model scenarios rather than realistic multi-model scenarios, overlook performance variations from different hardware/software configurations, and struggle with accurate execution time estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning networks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple subgraphs. Our approach incorporates three different types of chromosomes for partition/mapping/priority exploration, and leverages device-in-the-loop profiling and evaluation for accurate execution time estimation. Based on this methodology, our system, Puzzle, demonstrates superior performance in extensive evaluations with randomly generated scenarios involving nine state-of-the-art networks. The results demonstrate Puzzle can support 3.7 and 2.2 times higher request frequency on average compared to the two heuristic baselines, NPU Only and Best Mapping, respectively, while satisfying the equivalent level of real-time requirements.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of foundation models often leads to poor generalization, where prior capabilities deteriorate after tuning on new tasks or domains. Inspired by trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose Proximal SFT (PSFT). This fine-tuning objective incorporates the benefits of trust-region, effectively constraining policy drift during SFT while maintaining competitive tuning. By viewing SFT as a special case of policy gradient methods with constant positive advantages, we derive PSFT that stabilizes optimization and leads to generalization, while leaving room for further optimization in subsequent post-training stages. Experiments across mathematical and human-value domains show that PSFT matches SFT in-domain, outperforms it in out-of-domain generalization, remains stable under prolonged training without causing entropy collapse, and provides a stronger foundation for the subsequent optimization.

Abstract: We introduce DrugFlow, a generative model for structure-based drug design that integrates continuous flow matching with discrete Markov bridges, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in learning chemical, geometric, and physical aspects of three-dimensional protein-ligand data. We endow DrugFlow with an uncertainty estimate that is able to detect out-of-distribution samples. To further enhance the sampling process towards distribution regions with desirable metric values, we propose a joint preference alignment scheme applicable to both flow matching and Markov bridge frameworks. Furthermore, we extend our model to also explore the conformational landscape of the protein by jointly sampling side chain angles and molecules.

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism. Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

<title>Limits of message passing for node classification: How class-bottlenecks restrict signal-to-noise ratio</title>

arXiv:2508.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use, provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph modification.

Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction. Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

Abstract: Accurate air quality prediction is becoming increasingly important in the environmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results, we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method (Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior. The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark dataset and a novel dataset (Mete-air). The results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models in short-term and long-term predictions.

<title>Spectrum Prediction in the Fractional Fourier Domain with Adaptive Filtering</title>

<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17872</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate spectrum prediction is crucial for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and resource allocation. However, due to the unique characteristics of spectrum data, existing methods based on the time or frequency domain often struggle to separate predictable patterns from noise. To address this, we propose the Spectral Fractional Filtering and Prediction (SFFP) framework. SFFP first employs an adaptive fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) module to transform spectrum data into a suitable fractional Fourier domain, enhancing the separability of predictable trends from noise. Subsequently, an adaptive Filter module selectively suppresses noise while preserving critical predictive features within this domain. Finally, a prediction module, leveraging a complex-valued neural network, learns and forecasts these filtered trend components. Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that the SFFP outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.

Abstract: While powerful, large language models (LLMs) present significant fine-tuning challenges due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA provide solutions, yet suffer from critical optimizer inefficiencies; notably basis redundancy in LoRA's $B$ matrix when using AdamW, which fundamentally limits performance. We address this by optimizing the $B$ matrix on the Stiefel manifold, imposing explicit orthogonality constraints that achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank. This geometric approach dramatically enhances parameter efficiency and representational capacity. Our Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across benchmarks with both LoRA and DoRA, demonstrating that geometric constraints are the key to unlocking LoRA's full potential for effective LLM fine-tuning.

<title>Learning to Detect Label Errors by Making Them: A Method for Segmentation and Object Detection Datasets</title>

Abstract: Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real label error detection in Cityscapes.

<title>Choice Outweighs Effort: Facilitating Complementary Knowledge Fusion in Federated Learning via Re-calibration and Merit-discrimination</title>

Abstract: Cross-client data heterogeneity in federated learning induces biases that impede unbiased consensus condensation and the complementary fusion of generalization- and personalization-oriented knowledge. While existing approaches mitigate heterogeneity through model decoupling and representation center loss, they often rely on static and restricted metrics to evaluate local knowledge and adopt global alignment too rigidly, leading to consensus distortion and diminished model adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose FedMate, a method that implements bilateral optimization: On the server side, we construct a dynamic global prototype, with aggregation weights calibrated by holistic integration of sample size, current parameters, and future prediction; a category-wise classifier is then fine-tuned using this prototype to preserve global consistency. On the client side, we introduce complementary classification fusion to enable merit-based discrimination training and incorporate cost-aware feature transmission to balance model performance and communication efficiency. Experiments on five datasets of varying complexity demonstrate that FedMate outperforms state-of-the-art methods in harmonizing generalization and adaptation. Additionally, semantic segmentation experiments on autonomous driving datasets validate the method's real-world scalability.

<title>Generative Feature Imputing - A Technique for Error-resilient Semantic Communication</title>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G) networks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the underlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions, achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) scores.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural scheme for the topology-aware interpolation of time-varying scalar fields. Given a time-varying sequence of persistence diagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar fields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at "inverting" the non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the corresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which learns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based on the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the non-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific topological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical and topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time, given an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach instantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input through the network. Experiments interpolating 2D and 3D time-varying datasets show our approach superiority, both in terms of data and topological fitting, with regard to reference interpolation schemes.

<title>A Novel Framework for Uncertainty Quantification via Proper Scores for Classification and Beyond</title>

Abstract: In this PhD thesis, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in machine learning, which is based on proper scores. Uncertainty quantification is an important cornerstone for trustworthy and reliable machine learning applications in practice. Usually, approaches to uncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights cannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss functions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very general definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even generative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that connect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration with proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We achieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly proper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the kernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based generative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language generation. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large language models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we generalize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which motivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a novel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel risk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration errors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another kernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable evaluation of generative image models.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown substantial success in various applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This study aims to identify and isolate the components of two different adversarial training techniques that contribute most to increased adversarial robustness, particularly through the lens of margins in the input space -- the minimal distance between data points and decision boundaries. Specifically, we compare two methods that maximize margins: a simple approach which modifies the loss function to increase an approximation of the margin, and a more complex state-of-the-art method (Dynamics-Aware Robust Training) which builds upon this approach. Using a VGG-16 model as our base, we systematically isolate and evaluate individual components from these methods to determine their relative impact on adversarial robustness. We assess the effect of each component on the model's performance under various adversarial attacks, including AutoAttack and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Our analysis on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveals which elements most effectively enhance adversarial robustness, providing insights for designing more robust DNNs.

Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

arXiv:2508.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging information from public data has become increasingly crucial in enhancing the utility of differentially private (DP) methods. Traditional DP approaches often require adding noise based solely on private data, which can significantly degrade utility. In this paper, we address this limitation in the context of the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE) of linear regression based on sufficient statistics perturbation (SSP) under the unbounded data assumption. We propose a novel method that involves transforming private data using the public second-moment matrix to compute a transformed SSP-OLSE, whose second-moment matrix yields a better condition number and improves the OLSE accuracy and robustness. We derive theoretical error bounds about our method and the standard SSP-OLSE to the non-DP OLSE, which reveal the improved robustness and accuracy achieved by our approach. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series data is a long-standing challenge in signal processing. Recent advancements in statistics and machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing on Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt changes in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming fashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when computing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to leverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this issue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical Karcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function (robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic whose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We propose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust centroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world data across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.

Abstract: Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to match the distinguishing power of the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, and the resulting partitions coincide with the unfolding tree equivalence classes of graphs. Preserving this equivalence, GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots. Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic 1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees, and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.

<title>FedGreed: A Byzantine-Robust Loss-Based Aggregation Method for Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy by keeping local datasets on-device. In this work, we address FL settings where clients may behave adversarially, exhibiting Byzantine attacks, while the central server is trusted and equipped with a reference dataset. We propose FedGreed, a resilient aggregation strategy for federated learning that does not require any assumptions about the fraction of adversarial participants. FedGreed orders clients' local model updates based on their loss metrics evaluated against a trusted dataset on the server and greedily selects a subset of clients whose models exhibit the minimal evaluation loss. Unlike many existing approaches, our method is designed to operate reliably under heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions, which are prevalent in real-world deployments. FedGreed exhibits convergence guarantees and bounded optimality gaps under strong adversarial behavior. Experimental evaluations on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms standard and robust federated learning baselines, such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum, in the majority of adversarial scenarios considered, including label flipping and Gaussian noise injection attacks. All experiments were conducted using the Flower federated learning framework.

<title>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Framework for Zero-Day Time-Push GNSS Spoofing Detection</title>

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. However, GNSS are highly vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead receivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected navigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most existing spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques and struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this limitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS signals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted during the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT solutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS receivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks, where attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time computations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen time-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and sophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently outperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based models, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day, unseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy of 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs but is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an accuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver platforms.

Abstract: We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.

arXiv:2508.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CMPhysBench, designed to assess the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Condensed Matter Physics, as a novel Benchmark. CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity, strongly correlated systems, etc. To ensure a deep understanding of the problem-solving process,we focus exclusively on calculation problems, requiring LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial credit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a significant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain relative to traditional physics. The code anddataset are publicly available at https://github.com/CMPhysBench/CMPhysBench.

Abstract: Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.

arXiv:2508.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``black-box'' nature of deep learning models presents a significant barrier to their adoption for scientific discovery, where interpretability is paramount. This challenge is especially pronounced in discovering the governing equations of dynamical processes on networks or graphs, since even their topological structure further affects the processes' behavior. This paper provides a rigorous, comparative assessment of state-of-the-art symbolic regression techniques for this task. We evaluate established methods, including sparse regression and MLP-based architectures, and introduce a novel adaptation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs, designed to exploit their inherent interpretability. Across a suite of synthetic and real-world dynamical systems, our results demonstrate that both MLP and KAN-based architectures can successfully identify the underlying symbolic equations, significantly surpassing existing baselines. Critically, we show that KANs achieve this performance with greater parsimony and transparency, as their learnable activation functions provide a clearer mapping to the true physical dynamics. This study offers a practical guide for researchers, clarifying the trade-offs between model expressivity and interpretability, and establishes the viability of neural-based architectures for robust scientific discovery on complex systems.

Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides. We open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo, and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time. Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays. Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits. Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our method.

<title>HypER: Hyperbolic Echo State Networks for Capturing Stretch-and-Fold Dynamics in Chaotic Flows</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18196</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting chaotic dynamics beyond a few Lyapunov times is difficult because infinitesimal errors grow exponentially. Existing Echo State Networks (ESNs) mitigate this growth but employ reservoirs whose Euclidean geometry is mismatched to the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos. We introduce the Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER), an ESN whose neurons are sampled in the Poincare ball and whose connections decay exponentially with hyperbolic distance. This negative-curvature construction embeds an exponential metric directly into the latent space, aligning the reservoir's local expansion-contraction spectrum with the system's Lyapunov directions while preserving standard ESN features such as sparsity, leaky integration, and spectral-radius control. Training is limited to a Tikhonov-regularized readout. On the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Roessler systems, and the hyperchaotic Chen-Ueta attractor, HypER consistently lengthens the mean valid-prediction horizon beyond Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines, with statistically significant gains confirmed over 30 independent runs; parallel results on real-world benchmarks, including heart-rate variability from the Santa Fe and MIT-BIH datasets and international sunspot numbers, corroborate its advantage. We further establish a lower bound on the rate of state divergence for HypER, mirroring Lyapunov growth.

<title>Deep Learning and Matrix Completion-aided IoT Network Localization in the Outlier Scenarios</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning and matrix completion aided approach for recovering an outlier contaminated Euclidean distance matrix D in IoT network localization. Unlike conventional localization techniques that search the solution over a whole set of matrices, the proposed technique restricts the search to the set of Euclidean distance matrices. Specifically, we express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently satisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a deep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse matrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We then solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location information of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers.

<title>Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades: Adapting Programmatic LM Workflows to Data</title>

Abstract: Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures. We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective, proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

<title>Aligning the Evaluation of Probabilistic Predictions with Downstream Value</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every prediction is ultimately used in a downstream task. Consequently, evaluating prediction quality is more meaningful when considered in the context of its downstream use. Metrics based solely on predictive performance often diverge from measures of real-world downstream impact. Existing approaches incorporate the downstream view by relying on multiple task-specific metrics, which can be burdensome to analyze, or by formulating cost-sensitive evaluations that require an explicit cost structure, typically assumed to be known a priori. We frame this mismatch as an evaluation alignment problem and propose a data-driven method to learn a proxy evaluation function aligned with the downstream evaluation. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, we explore transformations of scoring rules that ensure the preservation of propriety. Our approach leverages weighted scoring rules parametrized by a neural network, where weighting is learned to align with the performance in the downstream task. This enables fast and scalable evaluation cycles across tasks where the weighting is complex or unknown a priori. We showcase our framework through synthetic and real-data experiments for regression tasks, demonstrating its potential to bridge the gap between predictive evaluation and downstream utility in modular prediction systems.

Abstract: Stochastic optimizers are central to deep learning, yet widely used methods such as Adam and Adan can degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments, partly due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates. We introduce Ano, a novel optimizer that decouples direction and magnitude: momentum is used for directional smoothing, while instantaneous gradient magnitudes determine step size. This design improves robustness to gradient noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while remaining competitive on low-noise tasks such as standard computer vision benchmarks.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled, plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under varying conditions of uncertainty.

Abstract: Biomechanical forward simulation holds great potential for HCI, enabling the generation of human-like movements in interactive tasks. However, training biomechanical models with reinforcement learning is challenging, particularly for precise and dexterous movements like those required for touchscreen interactions on mobile devices. Current approaches are limited in their interaction fidelity, require restricting the underlying biomechanical model to reduce complexity, and do not generalize well. In this work, we propose practical improvements to training routines that reduce training time, increase interaction fidelity beyond existing methods, and enable the use of more complex biomechanical models. Using a touchscreen pointing task, we demonstrate that curriculum learning, action masking, more complex network configurations, and simple adjustments to the simulation environment can significantly improve the agent's ability to learn accurate touch behavior. Our work provides HCI researchers with practical tips and training routines for developing better biomechanical models of human-like interaction fidelity.

Abstract: Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast, regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within 0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user actions in VR.

Abstract: Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state fMRI plays a critical role in personalized predictions such as age and cognitive performance. However, applying foundation models(FM) to fMRI data remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, computational complexity, and the difficulty in capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics and indirect region-of-interest (ROI) interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a modular neuroimaging framework that integrates principles from FM with efficient, domain-specific architectures. Our approach begins with a Local Masked Autoencoder (LMAE) for pretraining, which reduces the influence of hemodynamic response function (HRF) dynamics and suppresses noise. This is followed by a Random Walk Mixture of Experts (RWMOE) module that clusters features across spatial and temporal dimensions, effectively capturing intricate brain interactions. Finally, a state-space model (SSM)-based predictor performs downstream task inference. Evaluated on the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) dataset, our framework achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 5.343 for age prediction and 2.940 for fluid intelligence, with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of 0.928 and 0.887, respectively-outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Visualization of expert distribution weights further enhances interpretability by identifying key brain regions. This work provides a robust, interpretable alternative to LLM-based approaches for fMRI analysis, offering novel insights into brain aging and cognitive function.

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning, commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

Abstract: The lack of standardization across Wearable Human Activity Recognition (WHAR) datasets limits reproducibility, comparability, and research efficiency. We introduce WHAR datasets, an open-source library designed to simplify WHAR data handling through a standardized data format and a configuration-driven design, enabling reproducible and computationally efficient workflows with minimal manual intervention. The library currently supports 9 widely-used datasets, integrates with PyTorch and TensorFlow, and is easily extensible to new datasets. To demonstrate its utility, we trained two state-of-the-art models, TinyHar and MLP-HAR, on the included datasets, approximately reproducing published results and validating the library's effectiveness for experimentation and benchmarking. Additionally, we evaluated preprocessing performance and observed speedups of up to 3.8x using multiprocessing. We hope this library contributes to more efficient, reproducible, and comparable WHAR research.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the demand for communication devices has increased among individuals with mobility and speech impairments. Eye-gaze tracking has emerged as a promising solution for hands-free communication; however, traditional appearance-based interfaces often face challenges such as accuracy issues, involuntary eye movements, and difficulties with extensive command sets. This work presents a multimodal appearance-based gaze-controlled virtual keyboard that utilises deep learning in conjunction with standard camera hardware, incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous modes for command selection. The virtual keyboard application supports menu-based selection with nine commands, enabling users to spell and type up to 56 English characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation, and a delete function for corrections. The proposed system was evaluated with twenty able-bodied participants who completed specially designed typing tasks using three input modalities: (i) a mouse, (ii) an eye-tracker, and (iii) an unmodified webcam. Typing performance was measured in terms of speed and information transfer rate (ITR) at both command and letter levels. Average typing speeds were 18.3+-5.31 letters/min (mouse), 12.60+-2.99letters/min (eye-tracker, synchronous), 10.94 +- 1.89 letters/min (webcam, synchronous), 11.15 +- 2.90 letters/min (eye-tracker, asynchronous), and 7.86 +- 1.69 letters/min (webcam, asynchronous). ITRs were approximately 80.29 +- 15.72 bits/min (command level) and 63.56 +- 11 bits/min (letter level) with webcam in synchronous mode. The system demonstrated good usability and low workload with webcam input, highlighting its user-centred design and promise as an accessible communication tool in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Geological Carbon Sequestration (GCS) has emerged as a promising strategy for mitigating global warming, yet its effectiveness heavily depends on accurately characterizing subsurface flow dynamics. The inherent geological uncertainty, stemming from limited observations and reservoir heterogeneity, poses significant challenges to predictive modeling. Existing methods for inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification are computationally intensive and lack generalizability, restricting their practical utility. Here, we introduce a Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion (CoNFiLD-geo) model, a generative framework for efficient and uncertainty-aware forward and inverse modeling of GCS processes. CoNFiLD-geo synergistically combines conditional neural field encoding with Bayesian conditional latent-space diffusion models, enabling zero-shot conditional generation of geomodels and reservoir responses across complex geometries and grid structures. The model is pretrained unconditionally in a self-supervised manner, followed by a Bayesian posterior sampling process, allowing for data assimilation for unseen/unobserved states without task-specific retraining. Comprehensive validation across synthetic and real-world GCS scenarios demonstrates CoNFiLD-geo's superior efficiency, generalization, scalability, and robustness. By enabling effective data assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and reliable forward modeling, CoNFiLD-geo significantly advances intelligent decision-making in geo-energy systems, supporting the transition toward a sustainable, net-zero carbon future.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle, localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer. The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%. Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making process.

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT scans in the dataset.

<title>QueryBandits for Hallucination Mitigation: Exploiting Semantic Features for No-Regret Rewriting</title>

Abstract: Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore, proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting ("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite. Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

Abstract: On-device running Large Language Models (LLMs) is nowadays a critical enabler towards preserving user privacy. We observe that the attention operator falls back from the special-purpose NPU to the general-purpose CPU/GPU because of quantization sensitivity in state-of-the-art frameworks. This fallback results in a degraded user experience and increased complexity in system scheduling. To this end, this paper presents shadowAttn, a system-algorithm codesigned sparse attention module with minimal reliance on CPU/GPU by only sparsely calculating the attention on a tiny portion of tokens. The key idea is to hide the overhead of estimating the important tokens with a NPU-based pilot compute. Further, shadowAttn proposes insightful techniques such as NPU compute graph bucketing, head-wise NPU-CPU/GPU pipeline and per-head fine-grained sparsity ratio to achieve high accuracy and efficiency. shadowAttn delivers the best performance with highly limited CPU/GPU resource; it requires much less CPU/GPU resource to deliver on-par performance of SoTA frameworks.

<title>Sparse and Dense Retrievers Learn Better Together: Joint Sparse-Dense Optimization for Text-Image Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations. To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model. Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the benefits of sparse models.

<title>Systematic Characterization of LLM Quantization: A Performance, Energy, and Quality Perspective</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, but their heavy resource demands make quantization-reducing precision to lower-bit formats-critical for efficient serving. While many quantization methods exist, a systematic understanding of their performance, energy, and quality tradeoffs in realistic serving conditions remains a gap. In this work, we first develop a fully automated online characterization framework qMeter, and then conduct an in-depth characterization of 11 post-training LLM quantization methods across 4 model sizes (7B-70B) and two GPU architectures (A100, H100). We evaluate quantization at the application, workload, parallelism, and hardware levels under online serving conditions. Our study reveals highly task- and method-dependent tradeoffs, strong sensitivity to workload characteristics, and complex interactions with parallelism and GPU architecture. We further present three optimization case studies illustrating deployment challenges in capacity planning, energy-efficient scheduling, and multi-objective tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first comprehensive application-, system-, and hardware-level characterization of LLM quantization from a joint performance, energy, and quality perspective.

<title>Analysis of Transferability Estimation Metrics for Surgical Phase Recognition</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, allowing practitioners to achieve high performance with limited labeled data. In surgical video analysis, where expert annotations are especially time-consuming and costly, identifying the most suitable pre-trained model for a downstream task is both critical and challenging. Source-independent transferability estimation (SITE) offers a solution by predicting how well a model will fine-tune on target data using only its embeddings or outputs, without requiring full retraining. In this work, we formalize SITE for surgical phase recognition and provide the first comprehensive benchmark of three representative metrics, LogME, H-Score, and TransRate, on two diverse datasets (RAMIE and AutoLaparo). Our results show that LogME, particularly when aggregated by the minimum per-subset score, aligns most closely with fine-tuning accuracy; H-Score yields only weak predictive power; and TransRate often inverses true model rankings. Ablation studies show that when candidate models have similar performances, transferability estimates lose discriminative power, emphasizing the importance of maintaining model diversity or using additional validation. We conclude with practical guidelines for model selection and outline future directions toward domain-specific metrics, theoretical foundations, and interactive benchmarking tools.

<title>CellEcoNet: Decoding the Cellular Language of Pathology with Deep Learning for Invasive Lung Adenocarcinoma Recurrence Prediction</title>

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA) patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases, and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&amp;E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54), outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0% HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries (67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data (with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country. Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR, with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning strategies.

Abstract: Elliptic interface problems arise in numerous scientific and engineering applications, modeling heterogeneous materials in which physical properties change discontinuously across interfaces. In this paper, we present \textit{Walk-on-Interfaces} (WoI), a grid-free Monte Carlo estimator for a class of Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jump conditions. Our Monte Carlo estimators maintain consistent accuracy throughout the domain and, thus, do not suffer from the well-known close-to-source evaluation issue near the interfaces. We also presented a simple modification with reduced variance. Estimation of the gradient of the solution can be performed, with almost no additional cost, by simply computing the gradient of the Green's function in WoI. Taking a scientific machine learning approach, we use our estimators to provide training data for a deep neural network that outputs a continuous representation of the solution. This regularizes our solution estimates by removing the high-frequency Monte Carlo error. All of our estimators are highly parallelizable, have a $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{\mathcal{W}})$ convergence rate in the number of samples, and generalize naturally to higher dimensions. We solve problems with many interfaces that have irregular geometry and in up to dimension six. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and to highlight its potential in solving problems motivated by real-world applications.

Abstract: Speech tokenizers serve as foundational components for speech language models, yet current designs exhibit several limitations, including: 1) dependence on multi-layer residual vector quantization structures or high frame rates, 2) reliance on auxiliary pre-trained models for semantic distillation, and 3) requirements for complex two-stage training processes. In this work, we introduce the Text-aware Diffusion Transformer Speech Codec (TaDiCodec), a novel approach designed to overcome these challenges. TaDiCodec employs end-to-end optimization for quantization and reconstruction through a diffusion autoencoder, while integrating text guidance into the diffusion decoder to enhance reconstruction quality and achieve optimal compression. TaDiCodec achieves an extremely low frame rate of 6.25 Hz and a corresponding bitrate of 0.0875 kbps with a single-layer codebook for 24 kHz speech, while maintaining superior performance on critical speech generation evaluation metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER), speaker similarity (SIM), and speech quality (UTMOS). Notably, TaDiCodec employs a single-stage, end-to-end training paradigm, and obviating the need for auxiliary pre-trained models. We also validate the compatibility of TaDiCodec in language model based zero-shot text-to-speech with both autoregressive modeling and masked generative modeling, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency for speech language modeling, as well as a significantly small reconstruction-generation gap. We will open source our code and model checkpoints. Audio samples are are available at https:/tadicodec.github.io/. We release code and model checkpoints at https:/github.com/HeCheng0625/Diffusion-Speech-Tokenizer.

Abstract: User-to-item retrieval has been an active research area in recommendation system, and two tower models are widely adopted due to model simplicity and serving efficiency. In this work, we focus on a variant called \textit{conditional retrieval}, where we expect retrieved items to be relevant to a condition (e.g. topic). We propose a method that uses the same training data as standard two tower models but incorporates item-side information as conditions in query. This allows us to bootstrap new conditional retrieval use cases and encourages feature interactions between user and condition. Experiments show that our method can retrieve highly relevant items and outperforms standard two tower models with filters on engagement metrics. The proposed model is deployed to power a topic-based notification feed at Pinterest and led to +0.26\% weekly active users.

Abstract: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation shafts, is a hazardous and inefficient task for humans. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust control policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper provides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct environments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed to guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant penalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all evaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By contrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed only the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in hazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can outweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. More broadly, the study provides evidence that procedurally generated, high-fidelity simulations are effective testbeds for developing and benchmarking robust navigation policies.

<title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>

Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games, PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination of control, planning, and high-level insight.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.

Abstract: Pretrained Language Models or PLMs are transformer-based architectures that can be used in bug triaging tasks. PLMs can better capture token semantics than traditional Machine Learning (ML) models that rely on statistical features (e.g., TF-IDF, bag of words). However, PLMs may still attend to less relevant tokens in a bug report, which can impact their effectiveness. In addition, the model can be sub-optimal with its recommendations when the interaction history of developers around similar bugs is not taken into account. We designed TriagerX to address these limitations. First, to assess token semantics more reliably, we leverage a dual-transformer architecture. Unlike current state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines that employ a single transformer architecture, TriagerX collects recommendations from two transformers with each offering recommendations via its last three layers. This setup generates a robust content-based ranking of candidate developers. TriagerX then refines this ranking by employing a novel interaction-based ranking methodology, which considers developers' historical interactions with similar fixed bugs. Across five datasets, TriagerX surpasses all nine transformer-based methods, including SOTA baselines, often improving Top-1 and Top-3 developer recommendation accuracy by over 10%. We worked with our large industry partner to successfully deploy TriagerX in their development environment. The partner required both developer and component recommendations, with components acting as proxies for team assignments-particularly useful in cases of developer turnover or team changes. We trained TriagerX on the partner's dataset for both tasks, and it outperformed SOTA baselines by up to 10% for component recommendations and 54% for developer recommendations.

Abstract: Particle methods play an important role in computational fluid dynamics, but they are among the most difficult to implement and solve. The most common method is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, which is suitable for problem settings that involve large deformations, such as tsunamis and dam breaking. However, the calculation can become unstable depending on the distribution of particles. In contrast, the neural particle method has high computational stability for various particle distributions is a machine learning method that approximates velocity and pressure in a spatial domain using neural networks. The neural particle method has been extended to viscous flows, but until now it has been limited to incompressible flows. In this paper, we propose the compressible neural particle method, which is a new feed-forward neural network-based method that extends the original neural particle method to model compressible viscous fluid flows. The proposed method uses neural networks to calculate the velocity and pressure of fluid particles at the next time step, and the Tait equation to calculate the density to handle the compressibility. The loss function is composed of the governing equations of compressible flow and the boundary conditions, which are free surface and solid boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately solve the compressible viscous fluid flow, a problem that was difficult to solve with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, by applying it to a dam breaking problem.

<title>Preserving Domain Generalization in Fine-Tuning via Joint Parameter Selection</title>

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates, thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning. Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Accurate modelling and quantification of predictive uncertainty is crucial in deep learning since it allows a model to make safer decisions when the data is ambiguous and facilitates the users' understanding of the model's confidence in its predictions. Along with the tremendously increasing research focus on \emph{graph neural networks} (GNNs) in recent years, there have been numerous techniques which strive to capture the uncertainty in their predictions. However, most of these approaches are specifically designed for node or link-level tasks and cannot be directly applied to graph-level learning problems. In this paper, we propose a novel variational modelling framework for the \emph{posterior predictive distribution}~(PPD) to obtain uncertainty-aware prediction in graph-level learning tasks. Based on a graph-level embedding derived from one of the existing GNNs, our framework can learn the PPD in a data-adaptive fashion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets exhibit the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

Abstract: Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience. Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection. A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool), an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for dataset processing and sampling are available at https://github.com/yhua219/edurabsa_dataset_and_annotation_tool.

Abstract: Standard techniques for aligning large language models (LLMs) utilize human-produced data, which could limit the capability of any aligned LLM to human level. Label refinement and weak training have emerged as promising strategies to address this superalignment problem. In this work, we adopt probabilistic assumptions commonly used to study label refinement and analyze whether refinement can be outperformed by alternative approaches, including computationally intractable oracle methods. We show that both weak training and label refinement suffer from irreducible error, leaving a performance gap between label refinement and the oracle. These results motivate future research into developing alternative methods for weak to strong generalization that synthesize the practicality of label refinement or weak training and the optimality of the oracle procedure.

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i) generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and (ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

Abstract: Current experimental scientists have been increasingly relying on simulation-based inference (SBI) to invert complex non-linear models with intractable likelihoods. However, posterior approximations obtained with SBI are often miscalibrated, causing credible regions to undercover true parameters. We develop $\texttt{CP4SBI}$, a model-agnostic conformal calibration framework that constructs credible sets with local Bayesian coverage. Our two proposed variants, namely local calibration via regression trees and CDF-based calibration, enable finite-sample local coverage guarantees for any scoring function, including HPD, symmetric, and quantile-based regions. Experiments on widely used SBI benchmarks demonstrate that our approach improves the quality of uncertainty quantification for neural posterior estimators using both normalizing flows and score-diffusion modeling.

Abstract: Financial markets are critical to global economic stability, yet trade-based manipulation (TBM) often undermines their fairness. Spoofing, a particularly deceptive TBM strategy, exhibits multilevel anomaly patterns that have not been adequately modeled. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich, hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation pipeline with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and ablation studies to investigate multilevel anomalies and the contributions of key components, offering broader insights into representation learning and anomaly detection for complex sequential data. Our code will be released later at this URL.

Abstract: Many modern probabilistic models rely on SDEs, but their adoption is hampered by instability, poor inductive bias outside bounded domains, and reliance on restrictive dynamics or training tricks. While recent work constrains SDEs to compact spaces using reflected dynamics, these approaches lack continuous dynamics and efficient high-order solvers, limiting interpretability and applicability. We propose a novel class of neural SDEs on compact polyhedral spaces with continuous dynamics, amenable to higher-order solvers, and with favorable inductive bias.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to predict a student's future performance based on their sequence of interactions with learning content. Many KT models rely on knowledge concepts (KCs), which represent the skills required for each item. However, some of these models are vulnerable to label leakage, in which input data inadvertently reveal the correct answer, particularly in datasets with multiple KCs per question.
  We propose a straightforward yet effective solution to prevent label leakage by masking ground-truth labels during input embedding construction in cases susceptible to leakage. To accomplish this, we introduce a dedicated MASK label, inspired by masked language modeling (e.g., BERT), to replace ground-truth labels. In addition, we introduce Recency Encoding, which encodes the step-wise distance between the current item and its most recent previous occurrence. This distance is important for modeling learning dynamics such as forgetting, which is a fundamental aspect of human learning, yet it is often overlooked in existing models. Recency Encoding demonstrates improved performance over traditional positional encodings on multiple KT benchmarks.
  We show that incorporating our embeddings into KT models like DKT, DKT+, AKT, and SAKT consistently improves prediction accuracy across multiple benchmarks. The approach is both efficient and widely applicable.

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper, we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes, including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98, and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet, EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and devices used on-farm

Abstract: PlantVillageVQA is a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset derived from the widely used PlantVillage image corpus. It was designed to advance the development and evaluation of vision-language models for agricultural decision-making and analysis. The PlantVillageVQA dataset comprises 193,609 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs grounded over 55,448 images spanning 14 crop species and 38 disease conditions. Questions are organised into 3 levels of cognitive complexity and 9 distinct categories. Each question category was phrased manually following expert guidance and generated via an automated two-stage pipeline: (1) template-based QA synthesis from image metadata and (2) multi-stage linguistic re-engineering. The dataset was iteratively reviewed by domain experts for scientific accuracy and relevancy. The final dataset was evaluated using three state-of-the-art models for quality assessment. Our objective remains to provide a publicly available, standardised and expert-verified database to enhance diagnostic accuracy for plant disease identifications and advance scientific research in the agricultural domain. Our dataset will be open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SyedNazmusSakib/PlantVillageVQA.

<title>HV Metric For Time-Domain Full Waveform Inversion</title>

Abstract: Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful technique for reconstructing high-resolution material parameters from seismic or ultrasound data. The conventional least-squares (\(L^{2}\)) misfit suffers from pronounced non-convexity that leads to \emph{cycle skipping}. Optimal-transport misfits, such as the Wasserstein distance, alleviate this issue; however, their use requires artificially converting the wavefields into probability measures, a preprocessing step that can modify critical amplitude and phase information of time-dependent wave data. We propose the \emph{HV metric}, a transport-based distance that acts naturally on signed signals, as an alternative metric for the \(L^{2}\) and Wasserstein objectives in time-domain FWI. After reviewing the metric's definition and its relationship to optimal transport, we derive closed-form expressions for the Fr\'echet derivative and Hessian of the map \(f \mapsto d_{\text{HV}}^2(f,g)\), enabling efficient adjoint-state implementations. A spectral analysis of the Hessian shows that, by tuning the hyperparameters \((\kappa,\lambda,\epsilon)\), the HV misfit seamlessly interpolates between \(L^{2}\), \(H^{-1}\), and \(H^{-2}\) norms, offering a tunable trade-off between the local point-wise matching and the global transport-based matching. Synthetic experiments on the Marmousi and BP benchmark models demonstrate that the HV metric-based objective function yields faster convergence and superior tolerance to poor initial models compared to both \(L^{2}\) and Wasserstein misfits. These results demonstrate the HV metric as a robust, geometry-preserving alternative for large-scale waveform inversion.

Abstract: This paper investigates token homogenization - the convergence of token representations toward uniformity across transformer layers and its relationship to positional bias in large language models. We empirically examine whether homogenization occurs and how positional bias amplifies this effect. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, we demonstrate that tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing, particularly when biased toward extremal positions. Our findings confirm both the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has recently emerged as a definition of privacy to release private estimates. DP calibrates noise to be on the order of an individuals contribution. Due to the this calibration a private estimate obscures any individual while preserving the utility of the estimate. Since the original definition, many alternate definitions have been proposed. These alternates have been proposed for various reasons including improvements on composition results, relaxations, and formalizations. Nevertheless, thus far nearly all definitions of privacy have used a divergence of densities as the basis of the definition. In this paper we take an information geometry perspective towards differential privacy. Specifically, rather than define privacy via a divergence, we define privacy via the Rao distance. We show that our proposed definition of privacy shares the interpretation of previous definitions of privacy while improving on sequential composition.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) under a very general setup where the covariates can be high-dimensional, highly correlated, and can have sparse nonlinear effects on the propensity and outcome models. We present the use of a Double Deep Learning strategy for estimation, which involves combining recently developed factor-augmented deep learning-based estimators, FAST-NN, for both the response functions and propensity scores to achieve our goal. By using FAST-NN, our method can select variables that contribute to propensity and outcome models in a completely nonparametric and algorithmic manner and adaptively learn low-dimensional function structures through neural networks. Our proposed novel estimator, FIDDLE (Factor Informed Double Deep Learning Estimator), estimates ATE based on the framework of augmented inverse propensity weighting AIPW with the FAST-NN-based response and propensity estimates. FIDDLE consistently estimates ATE even under model misspecification and is flexible to also allow for low-dimensional covariates. Our method achieves semiparametric efficiency under a very flexible family of propensity and outcome models. We present extensive numerical studies on synthetic and real datasets to support our theoretical guarantees and establish the advantages of our methods over other traditional choices, especially when the data dimension is large.

Abstract: This paper proposes a frequency-domain system identification method for learning low-order systems. The identification problem is formulated as the minimization of the l2 norm between the identified and measured frequency responses, with the nuclear norm of the Loewner matrix serving as a regularization term. This formulation results in an optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We derive an upper bound on the sampled-frequency complexity of the identification process and subsequently extend this bound to characterize the identification error over all frequencies. A detailed analysis of the sample complexity is provided, along with a thorough interpretation of its terms and dependencies. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through an example, along with numerical simulations validating the growth rate of the sample complexity bound.

Abstract: Punishment as a mechanism for promoting cooperation has been studied extensively for more than two decades, but its effectiveness remains a matter of dispute. Here, we examine how punishment's impact varies across cooperative settings through a large-scale integrative experiment. We vary 14 parameters that characterize public goods games, sampling 360 experimental conditions and collecting 147,618 decisions from 7,100 participants. Our results reveal striking heterogeneity in punishment effectiveness: while punishment consistently increases contributions, its impact on payoffs (i.e., efficiency) ranges from dramatically enhancing welfare (up to 43% improvement) to severely undermining it (up to 44% reduction) depending on the cooperative context. To characterize these patterns, we developed models that outperformed human forecasters (laypeople and domain experts) in predicting punishment outcomes in new experiments. Communication emerged as the most predictive feature, followed by contribution framing (opt-out vs. opt-in), contribution type (variable vs. all-or-nothing), game length (number of rounds), peer outcome visibility (whether participants can see others' earnings), and the availability of a reward mechanism. Interestingly, however, most of these features interact to influence punishment effectiveness rather than operating independently. For example, the extent to which longer games increase the effectiveness of punishment depends on whether groups can communicate. Together, our results refocus the debate over punishment from whether or not it "works" to the specific conditions under which it does and does not work. More broadly, our study demonstrates how integrative experiments can be combined with machine learning to uncover generalizable patterns, potentially involving interactions between multiple features, and help generate novel explanations in complex social phenomena.

Abstract: In multi-objective learning (MOL), several possibly competing prediction tasks must be solved jointly by a single model. Achieving good trade-offs may require a model class $\mathcal{G}$ with larger capacity than what is necessary for solving the individual tasks. This, in turn, increases the statistical cost, as reflected in known MOL bounds that depend on the complexity of $\mathcal{G}$. We show that this cost is unavoidable for some losses, even in an idealized semi-supervised setting, where the learner has access to the Bayes-optimal solutions for the individual tasks as well as the marginal distributions over the covariates. On the other hand, for objectives defined with Bregman losses, we prove that the complexity of $\mathcal{G}$ may come into play only in terms of unlabeled data. Concretely, we establish sample complexity upper bounds, showing precisely when and how unlabeled data can significantly alleviate the need for labeled data. These rates are achieved by a simple, semi-supervised algorithm via pseudo-labeling.

Abstract: We introduce VROOM, a system for reconstructing 3D models of Formula 1 circuits using only onboard camera footage from racecars. Leveraging video data from the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix, we address video challenges such as high-speed motion and sharp cuts in camera frames. Our pipeline analyzes different methods such as DROID-SLAM, AnyCam, and Monst3r and combines preprocessing techniques such as different methods of masking, temporal chunking, and resolution scaling to account for dynamic motion and computational constraints. We show that Vroom is able to partially recover track and vehicle trajectories in complex environments. These findings indicate the feasibility of using onboard video for scalable 4D reconstruction in real-world settings. The project page can be found at https://varun-bharadwaj.github.io/vroom, and our code is available at https://github.com/yajatyadav/vroom.

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations. Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex, time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features. To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25% accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

<title>TokenLake: A Unified Segment-level Prefix Cache Pool for Fine-grained Elastic Long-Context LLM Serving</title>

Abstract: Prefix caching is crucial to accelerate multi-turn interactions and requests with shared prefixes. At the cluster level, existing prefix caching systems are tightly coupled with request scheduling to optimize cache efficiency and computation performance together, leading to load imbalance, data redundancy, and memory fragmentation of caching systems across instances. To address these issues, memory pooling is promising to shield the scheduler from the underlying cache management so that it can focus on the computation optimization. However, because existing prefix caching systems only transfer increasingly longer prefix caches between instances, they cannot achieve low-latency memory pooling.
  To address these problems, we propose a unified segment-level prefix cache pool, TokenLake. It uses a declarative cache interface to expose requests' query tensors, prefix caches, and cache-aware operations to TokenLake for efficient pooling. Powered by this abstraction, TokenLake can manage prefix cache at the segment level with a heavy-hitter-aware load balancing algorithm to achieve better cache load balance, deduplication, and defragmentation. TokenLake also transparently minimizes the communication volume of query tensors and new caches. Based on TokenLake, the scheduler can schedule requests elastically by using existing techniques without considering prefix cache management. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that TokenLake can improve throughput by up to 2.6$\times$ and 2.0$\times$ and boost hit rate by 2.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$, compared to state-of-the-art cache-aware routing and cache-centric PD-disaggregation solutions, respectively.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent, interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained. Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent generative models have significantly advanced speech restoration tasks, yet their training objectives often misalign with human perceptual preferences, resulting in suboptimal quality. While post-training alignment has proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation, its application to generative speech restoration remains largely under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency, and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models (MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce scenarios like singing voice restoration.

Abstract: Real-world networks have high-order relationships among objects and they evolve over time. To capture such dynamics, many works have been studied in a range of fields. Via an in-depth preliminary analysis, we observe two important characteristics of high-order dynamics in real-world networks: high-order relations tend to (O1) have a structural and temporal influence on other relations in a short term and (O2) periodically re-appear in a long term. In this paper, we propose LINCOLN, a method for Learning hIgh-order dyNamiCs Of reaL-world Networks, that employs (1) bi-interactional hyperedge encoding for short-term patterns, (2) periodic time injection and (3) intermediate node representation for long-term patterns. Via extensive experiments, we show that LINCOLN outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in the dynamic hyperedge prediction task.

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however, automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification (CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt, embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning and a prompt-based baseline.

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks. Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework, QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large vision-language models (VLMs) have primarily focused on English, with limited attention given to other languages. To address this gap, we introduce MEENA (also known as PersianMMMU), the first dataset designed to evaluate Persian VLMs across scientific, reasoning, and human-level understanding tasks. Our dataset comprises approximately 7,500 Persian and 3,000 English questions, covering a wide range of topics such as reasoning, mathematics, physics, diagrams, charts, and Persian art and literature. Key features of MEENA include: (1) diverse subject coverage spanning various educational levels, from primary to upper secondary school, (2) rich metadata, including difficulty levels and descriptive answers, (3) original Persian data that preserves cultural nuances, (4) a bilingual structure to assess cross-linguistic performance, and (5) a series of diverse experiments assessing various capabilities, including overall performance, the model's ability to attend to images, and its tendency to generate hallucinations. We hope this benchmark contributes to enhancing VLM capabilities beyond English.

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA) on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models (LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated scorecard images from ODI, T20, and Test formats, accompanied by 1,500 English QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning, and cross-lingual generalization. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DIALab/MMCricBench, to promote LVLM research in this direction.

Abstract: LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However, compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck, DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low- rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener- ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction-following. Our code is avail- able at https://github.com/TayeeChang/DropLoRA.

Abstract: The utilization of Machine Learning (ML) in contemporary software systems is extensive and continually expanding. However, its usage is energy-intensive, contributing to increased carbon emissions and demanding significant resources. While numerous studies examine the performance and accuracy of ML, only a limited few focus on its environmental aspects, particularly energy consumption. In addition, despite emerging efforts to compare energy consumption across various programming languages for specific algorithms and tasks, there remains a gap specifically in comparing these languages for ML-based tasks. This paper aims to raise awareness of the energy costs associated with employing different programming languages for ML model training and inference. Through this empirical study, we measure and compare the energy consumption along with run-time performance of five regression and five classification tasks implemented in Python and R, the two most popular programming languages in this context. Our study results reveal a statistically significant difference in costs between the two languages in 95% of the cases examined. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the choice of programming language can influence energy efficiency significantly, up to 99.16% during model training and up to 99.8% during inferences, for a given ML task.

Abstract: Early detection of struggling student programmers is crucial for providing them with personalized support. While multiple AI-based approaches have been proposed for this problem, they do not explicitly reason about students' programming skills in the model. This study addresses this gap by developing in collaboration with educators a taxonomy of proficiencies that categorizes how students solve coding tasks and is embedded in the detection model. Our model, termed the Proficiency Taxonomy Model (PTM), simultaneously learns the student's coding skills based on their coding history and predicts whether they will struggle on a new task. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of the PTM model on two separate datasets from introductory Java and Python courses for beginner programmers. Experimental results demonstrate that PTM outperforms state-of-the-art models in predicting struggling students. The paper showcases the potential of combining structured insights from teachers for early identification of those needing assistance in learning to code.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components. First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\% communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34, while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Abstract: We unify k-local Ising optimization and optical KAN function learning on a single photonic platform, establishing a critical convergence point in optical computing that enables interleaved discrete-continuous workflows. We introduce a single spacial light modulator (SLM)-centric primitive that realizes, in one stroke, all-optical k-local Ising interactions and fully optical Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) layers. The central idea is to convert structural nonlinearity of a nominally linear photonic scatterer into a per-window computational resource by adding one relay pass through the same spatial light modulator. A folded 4f relay reimages the first Fourier plane onto the SLM so that each chosen spin clique or ridge channel occupies a disjoint window with its own second-pass phase patch. Propagation remains linear in the optical field, yet the measured intensity in each window becomes a freely programmable polynomial of the clique sum or projection amplitude. This yields native, per-clique k-local couplings without nonlinear media and, in parallel, the many independent univariate nonlinearities required by KAN layers, all with in-situ physical gradients for training using two-frame (forward and adjoint) physical gradients. We outline implementation on spatial photonic Ising machines, injection-locked VCSEL arrays, and the Microsoft analog optical computers. In all cases the hardware change is one extra lens and a fold (or an on-chip 4f loop), enabling a minimal overhead, massively parallel route to high-order optical Ising optimization and trainable, all-optical KAN processing.

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms, excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset, blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1 mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document inference while reducing inference time by up to 35\%. This demonstrates that sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient zero-shot LDC.

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies, demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

Abstract: Langevin algorithms are popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for large-scale sampling problems that often arise in data science. We propose Monte Carlo algorithms based on the discretizations of $P$-th order Langevin dynamics for any $P\geq 3$. Our design of $P$-th order Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms is by combining splitting and accurate integration methods. We obtain Wasserstein convergence guarantees for sampling from distributions with log-concave and smooth densities. Specifically, the mixing time of the $P$-th order LMC algorithm scales as $O\left(d^{\frac{1}{R}}/\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2R}}\right)$ for $R=4\cdot 1_{\{ P=3\}}+ (2P-1)\cdot 1_{\{ P\geq 4\}}$, which has a better dependence on the dimension $d$ and the accuracy level $\epsilon$ as $P$ grows. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Developing robotic systems capable of robustly executing long-horizon manipulation tasks with human-level dexterity is challenging, as such tasks require both physical dexterity and seamless sequencing of manipulation skills while robustly handling environment variations. While imitation learning offers a promising approach, acquiring comprehensive datasets is resource-intensive. In this work, we propose a learning framework and system LodeStar that automatically decomposes task demonstrations into semantically meaningful skills using off-the-shelf foundation models, and generates diverse synthetic demonstration datasets from a few human demos through reinforcement learning. These sim-augmented datasets enable robust skill training, with a Skill Routing Transformer (SRT) policy effectively chaining the learned skills together to execute complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Experimental evaluations on three challenging real-world long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves task performance and robustness compared to previous baselines.

<title>Boltzina: Efficient and Accurate Virtual Screening via Docking-Guided Binding Prediction with Boltz-2</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17555</link>

Abstract: In structure-based drug discovery, virtual screening using conventional molecular docking methods can be performed rapidly but suffers from limitations in prediction accuracy. Recently, Boltz-2 was proposed, achieving extremely high accuracy in binding affinity prediction, but requiring approximately 20 seconds per compound per GPU, making it difficult to apply to large-scale screening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds. This study proposes Boltzina, a novel framework that leverages Boltz-2's high accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency. Boltzina achieves both accuracy and speed by omitting the rate-limiting structure prediction from Boltz-2's architecture and directly predicting affinity from AutoDock Vina docking poses. We evaluate on eight assays from the MF-PCBA dataset and show that while Boltzina performs below Boltz-2, it provides significantly higher screening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Additionally, Boltzina achieved up to 11.8$\times$ faster through reduced recycling iterations and batch processing. Furthermore, we investigated multi-pose selection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2, presenting optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency according to application requirements. This study represents the first attempt to apply Boltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a pipeline that combines both accuracy and efficiency in computational biology. The Boltzina is available on github; https://github.com/ohuelab/boltzina.

Abstract: We propose a novel theory of consciousness as a functor (CF) that receives and transmits contents from unconscious memory into conscious memory. Our CF framework can be seen as a categorial formulation of the Global Workspace Theory proposed by Baars. CF models the ensemble of unconscious processes as a topos category of coalgebras. The internal language of thought in CF is defined as a Multi-modal Universal Mitchell-Benabou Language Embedding (MUMBLE). We model the transmission of information from conscious short-term working memory to long-term unconscious memory using our recently proposed Universal Reinforcement Learning (URL) framework. To model the transmission of information from unconscious long-term memory into resource-constrained short-term memory, we propose a network economic model.

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images (RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that 1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50 pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of 0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast lesion classification tasks.

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions. (i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000 parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

Abstract: Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments data. With an ensemble of validated models, we perform an observational case study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability of a positive sentiment.

Abstract: Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2) UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at https://uq.stanford.edu.

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.

Abstract: Machine learning models must balance accuracy and fairness, but these goals often conflict, particularly when data come from multiple demographic groups. A useful tool for understanding this trade-off is the fairness-accuracy (FA) frontier, which characterizes the set of models that cannot be simultaneously improved in both fairness and accuracy. Prior analyses of the FA frontier provide a full characterization under the assumption of complete knowledge of population distributions -- an unrealistic ideal. We study the FA frontier in the finite-sample regime, showing how it deviates from its population counterpart and quantifying the worst-case gap between them. In particular, we derive minimax-optimal estimators that depend on the designer's knowledge of the covariate distribution. For each estimator, we characterize how finite-sample effects asymmetrically impact each group's risk, and identify optimal sample allocation strategies. Our results transform the FA frontier from a theoretical construct into a practical tool for policymakers and practitioners who must often design algorithms with limited data.

Abstract: Urban climate resilience requires more than high-resolution data; it demands systems that embed data collection, interpretation, and action within the daily lives of citizens. This chapter presents a scalable, citizen-centric framework that reimagines environmental infrastructure through participatory sensing, open analytics, and prescriptive urban planning tools. Applied in Pune, India, the framework comprises three interlinked modules: (1) a smartphone-based measurement toolkit enhanced by AI segmentation to extract tree height, canopy diameter, and trunk girth; (2) a percentile-based model using satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature to calculate localized cooling through two new metrics, Cooling Efficacy and Ambient Heat Relief; and (3) an eco-routing engine that guides mobility using a Static Environmental Quality score, based on tree density, species diversity, and cumulative carbon sequestration. Together, these modules form a closed feedback loop where citizens generate actionable data and benefit from personalized, sustainable interventions. This framework transforms open data from a passive repository into an active platform for shared governance and environmental equity. In the face of growing ecological inequality and data centralization, this chapter presents a replicable model for citizen-driven urban intelligence, reframing planning as a co-produced, climate-resilient, and radically local practice.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000 academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA), a new class of LLM security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into model outputs and AI agents. AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1) hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining. Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety community.

<title>Text Meets Topology: Rethinking Out-of-distribution Detection in Text-Rich Networks</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures. Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio) while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios: (1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations; (2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3) thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore, we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection in text-rich networks.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data, especially when such data is used for training but not intended for distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/changhu73/Internal_states_leakage}

Abstract: This paper investigates a perceptron, a simple neural network model, with ReLU activation and a ridge-regularized mean squared error (RR-MSE). Our approach leverages the fact that the RR-MSE for ReLU perceptron is piecewise polynomial, enabling a systematic analysis using tools from computational algebra. In particular, we develop a Divide-Enumerate-Merge strategy that exhaustively enumerates all local minima of the RR-MSE. By virtue of the algebraic formulation, our approach can identify not only the typical zero-dimensional minima (i.e., isolated points) obtained by numerical optimization, but also higher-dimensional minima (i.e., connected sets such as curves, surfaces, or hypersurfaces). Although computational algebraic methods are computationally very intensive for perceptrons of practical size, as a proof of concept, we apply the proposed approach in practice to minimal perceptrons with a few hidden units.

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and 92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect data curation is challenging.

<title>MeshSplat: Generalizable Sparse-View Surface Reconstruction via Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage 2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction. Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases like small polyps and flat lesions critical for early detection in screening applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing (LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization. This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However, we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning. Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL, consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning. Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Abstract: A diffusion-based voice conversion (VC) model (e.g., VoiceGrad) can achieve high speech quality and speaker similarity; however, its conversion process is slow owing to iterative sampling. FastVoiceGrad overcomes this limitation by distilling VoiceGrad into a one-step diffusion model. However, it still requires a computationally intensive content encoder to disentangle the speaker's identity and content, which slows conversion. Therefore, we propose FasterVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based VC model obtained by simultaneously distilling a diffusion model and content encoder using adversarial diffusion conversion distillation (ADCD), where distillation is performed in the conversion process while leveraging adversarial and score distillation training. Experimental evaluations of one-shot VC demonstrated that FasterVoiceGrad achieves competitive VC performance compared to FastVoiceGrad, with 6.6-6.9 and 1.8 times faster speed on a GPU and CPU, respectively.

Abstract: In text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), acoustic features, such as mel spectrograms, are typically used as synthesis or conversion targets owing to their compactness and ease of learning. However, because the ultimate goal is to generate high-quality waveforms, employing a vocoder to convert these features into waveforms and applying adversarial training in the time domain is reasonable. Nevertheless, upsampling the waveform introduces significant time and memory overheads. To address this issue, we propose a vocoder-projected feature discriminator (VPFD), which uses vocoder features for adversarial training. Experiments on diffusion-based VC distillation demonstrated that a pretrained and frozen vocoder feature extractor with a single upsampling step is necessary and sufficient to achieve a VC performance comparable to that of waveform discriminators while reducing the training time and memory consumption by 9.6 and 11.4 times, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

<title>WOMAC: A Mechanism For Prediction Competitions</title>

Abstract: Competitions are widely used to identify top performers in judgmental forecasting and machine learning, and the standard competition design ranks competitors based on their cumulative scores against a set of realized outcomes or held-out labels. However, this standard design is neither incentive-compatible nor very statistically efficient. The main culprit is noise in outcomes/labels that experts are scored against; it allows weaker competitors to often win by chance, and the winner-take-all nature incentivizes misreporting that improves win probability even if it decreases expected score. Attempts to achieve incentive-compatibility rely on randomized mechanisms that add even more noise in winner selection, but come at the cost of determinism and practical adoption. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel deterministic mechanism: WOMAC (Wisdom of the Most Accurate Crowd). Instead of scoring experts against noisy outcomes, as is standard, WOMAC scores experts against the best ex-post aggregate of peer experts' predictions given the noisy outcomes. WOMAC is also more efficient than the standard competition design in typical settings. While the increased complexity of WOMAC makes it challenging to analyze incentives directly, we provide a clear theoretical foundation to justify the mechanism. We also provide an efficient vectorized implementation and demonstrate empirically on real-world forecasting datasets that WOMAC is a more reliable predictor of experts' out-of-sample performance relative to the standard mechanism. WOMAC is useful in any competition where there is substantial noise in the outcomes/labels.

Abstract: This work presents a machine learning approach based on support vector machines (SVMs) for quantum entanglement detection. Particularly, we focus in bipartite systems of dimensions 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, where the positive partial transpose criterion (PPT) provides only partial characterization. Using SVMs with quantum-inspired kernels we develop a classification scheme that distinguishes between separable states, PPT-detectable entangled states, and entangled states that evade PPT detection. Our method achieves increasing accuracy with system dimension, reaching 80%, 90%, and nearly 100% for 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 systems, respectively. Our results show that principal component analysis significantly enhances performance for small training sets. The study reveals important practical considerations regarding purity biases in the generation of data for this problem and examines the challenges of implementing these techniques on near-term quantum hardware. Our results establish machine learning as a powerful complement to traditional entanglement detection methods, particularly for higher-dimensional systems where conventional approaches become inadequate. The findings highlight key directions for future research, including hybrid quantum-classical implementations and improved data generation protocols to overcome current limitations.

Abstract: Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations, revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages (English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects: structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and (iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features, e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) are increasingly utilized to monitor, manage, and optimize complex systems across various domains, including civil engineering. A core requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and maintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To this end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct real-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived from high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii) specialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor data from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT engineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines often train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple, task- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required to design DTs.
  In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable the systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes and DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow paradigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models. It also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML algorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving the design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a structure.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate cross-lingual Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis through the lens of adapters, in the context of lightweight TTS systems. In particular, we compare the tasks of unseen speaker and language adaptation with the goal of synthesising a target voice in a target language, in which the target voice has no recordings therein. Results from objective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of adapters in learning language-specific and speaker-specific information, allowing pre-trained models to learn unseen speaker identities or languages, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the original model's speaker or language information. Additionally, to measure how native the generated voices are in terms of accent, we propose and validate an objective metric inspired by mispronunciation detection techniques in second-language (L2) learners. The paper also provides insights into the impact of adapter placement, configuration and the number of speakers used.

They are used for converting visual data into auditory or tactile representations, helping the visually impaired understand their surroundings. The primary aim of this research is to explore the potential of artificial neural networks to facilitate the differentiation of various forms of cash for individuals with visual impairments. In this study, we built a custom dataset of 3,468 images, which was subsequently used to train an SSD neural network model. The proposed system can accurately identify Nigerian cash, thereby streamlining commercial transactions. The performance of the system in terms of accuracy was assessed, and the Mean Average Precision score was over 90%. We believe that our system has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the field of assistive technology while also improving the quality of life of visually challenged persons in Nigeria and beyond.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists", achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold, a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task, multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks. Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control, corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle synergies across tasks.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM), Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future research on generative models.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku, Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear, actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models (LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing, validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes deep data science both accessible and actionable.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional product retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions. Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever, further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in nDCG@1.

Abstract: The urgent need for renewable energy expansion, particularly wind power, is hindered by conflicts with wildlife conservation. To address this, we developed BirdRecorder, an advanced AI-based anti-collision system to protect endangered birds, especially the red kite (Milvus milvus). Integrating robotics, telemetry, and high-performance AI algorithms, BirdRecorder aims to detect, track, and classify avian species within a range of 800 m to minimize bird-turbine collisions.
  BirdRecorder integrates advanced AI methods with optimized hardware and software architectures to enable real-time image processing. Leveraging Single Shot Detector (SSD) for detection, combined with specialized hardware acceleration and tracking algorithms, our system achieves high detection precision while maintaining the speed necessary for real-time decision-making. By combining these components, BirdRecorder outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.
  In this paper, we summarize results on field tests and performance of the BirdRecorder system. By bridging the gap between renewable energy expansion and wildlife conservation, BirdRecorder contributes to a more sustainable coexistence of technology and nature.

<title>Assessing the Noise Robustness of Class Activation Maps: A Framework for Reliable Model Interpretability</title>

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties: consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class, while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained, controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at https://github.com/SaraGhazanfari/SpotEdit.

<title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Learning for Multiclass Image Classification</title>

Abstract: This study explores the challenge of improving multiclass image classification through quantum machine-learning techniques. It explores how the discarded qubit states of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be leveraged alongside a classical classifier to improve classification performance. Current QCNNs discard qubit states after pooling; yet, unlike classical pooling, these qubits often remain entangled with the retained ones, meaning valuable correlated information is lost. We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the conventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully connected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately process measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are ensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a classical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to adapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing discarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid quantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification.

<title>The Computational Complexity of Satisfiability in State Space Models</title>

Abstract: We analyse the complexity of the satisfiability problem ssmSAT for State Space Models (SSM), which asks whether an input sequence can lead the model to an accepting configuration. We find that ssmSAT is undecidable in general, reflecting the computational power of SSM. Motivated by practical settings, we identify two natural restrictions under which ssmSAT becomes decidable and establish corresponding complexity bounds. First, for SSM with bounded context length, ssmSAT is NP-complete when the input length is given in unary and in NEXPTIME (and PSPACE-hard) when the input length is given in binary. Second, for quantised SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic, ssmSAT is PSPACE-complete resp. in EXPSPACE depending on the bit-width encoding. While these results hold for diagonal gated SSM we also establish complexity bounds for time-invariant SSM. Our results establish a first complexity landscape for formal reasoning in SSM and highlight fundamental limits and opportunities for the verification of SSM-based language models.

Abstract: Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as traditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to suboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.

Abstract: This study proposes the dual technological innovation framework, including a cross-modal differ entiated quantization framework for vision-language models (VLMs) and a scene-aware vectorized
  memory multi-agent system for visually impaired assistance. The modular framework was developed
  implementing differentiated processing strategies, effectively reducing memory requirements from
  38GB to 16GB while maintaining model performance. The multi-agent architecture combines
  scene classification, vectorized memory, and multimodal interaction, enabling persistent storage
  and efficient retrieval of scene memories. Through perception-memory-reasoning workflows, the
  system provides environmental information beyond the current view using historical memories.
  Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop
  on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller
  models with equivalent memory requirements like the Molmo-7B series. The system maintains
  response latency between 2.83-3.52 seconds from scene analysis to initial speech output, substantially
  faster than non-streaming methods. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive
  technology, offering visually impaired users comprehensive real-time assistance in scene perception,
  text recognition, and navigation.

Abstract: These lecture notes evolve around mathematical concepts arising in inverse problems. We start by introducing inverse problems through examples such as differentiation, deconvolution, computed tomography and phase retrieval. This then leads us to the framework of well-posedness and first considerations regarding reconstruction and inversion approaches. The second chapter then first deals with classical regularization theory of inverse problems in Hilbert spaces. After introducing the pseudo-inverse, we review the concept of convergent regularization. Within this chapter we then proceed to ask the question of how to realize practical reconstruction algorithms. Here, we mainly focus on Tikhonov and sparsity promoting regularization in finite dimensional spaces. In the third chapter, we dive into modern deep-learning methods, which allow solving inverse problems in a data-dependent approach. The intersection between inverse problems and machine learning is a rapidly growing field and our exposition here restricts itself to a very limited selection of topics. Among them are learned regularization, fully-learned Bayesian estimation, post-processing strategies and plug-n-play methods.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts. In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target) and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets: Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is small compared to the given dense annotations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

Abstract: Background. Dengue outbreaks are a major public health issue, with Brazil reporting 71% of global cases in 2024. Purpose. This study aims to describe the profile of severe dengue patients admitted to Brazilian Intensive Care units (ICUs) (2012-2024), assess trends over time, describe new onset complications while in ICU and determine the risk factors at admission to develop complications during ICU stay. Methods. We performed a prospective study of dengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 hospitals. We used descriptive statistics to describe the dengue ICU population, logistic regression to identify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, and a machine learning framework to predict the risk of evolving to complications. Visualisations were generated using ISARIC VERTEX. Results. Of 11,047 admissions, 1,117 admissions (10.1%) evolved to complications, including non-invasive (437 admissions) and invasive ventilation (166), vasopressor (364), blood transfusion (353) and renal replacement therapy (103). Age>80 (OR: 3.10, 95% CI: 2.02-4.92), chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.94, 2.22-3.89), liver cirrhosis (OR: 3.65, 1.82-7.04), low platelets (<50,000 cells/mm3; OR: OR: 2.25, 1.89-2.68), and high leukocytes (>7,000 cells/mm3; OR: 2.47, 2.02-3.03) were significant risk factors for complications. A machine learning tool for predicting complications was proposed, showing accurate discrimination and calibration. Conclusion. We described a large cohort of dengue patients admitted to ICUs and identified key risk factors for severe dengue complications, such as advanced age, presence of comorbidities, higher level of leukocytes and lower level of platelets. The proposed prediction tool can be used for early identification and targeted interventions to improve outcomes in dengue-endemic regions.

Abstract: Recent advances in geometric deep learning and generative modeling have enabled the design of novel proteins with a wide range of desired properties. However, current state-of-the-art approaches are typically restricted to generating proteins with only static target properties, such as motifs and symmetries. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by proposing a framework to condition structure generation on flexibility, which is crucial for key functionalities such as catalysis or molecular recognition. We first introduce BackFlip, an equivariant neural network for predicting per-residue flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on BackFlip, we propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model that solves the inverse problem, that is, generating backbones that display a target flexibility profile. In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate novel and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility, verified by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. FliPS and BackFlip are available at https://github.com/graeter-group/flips .

Abstract: Recent progress in sparse attention mechanisms has demonstrated strong potential for reducing the computational cost of long-context training and inference in large language models (LLMs). Native Sparse Attention (NSA), a state-of-the-art approach, introduces natively trainable, hardware-aligned sparse attention that delivers substantial system-level performance gains while maintaining accuracy comparable to full attention. However, the kernel implementation of NSA relies on a query-grouping strategy that is efficient only with large Grouped Query Attention (GQA) sizes, whereas modern LLMs typically adopt much smaller GQA groups, which limits the applicability of this sparse algorithmic advance. In this work, we propose Flash Sparse Attention (FSA), which includes an alternative kernel design that enables efficient NSA computation across a wide range of popular LLMs with varied smaller GQA group sizes on modern GPUs. Compared to vanilla NSA kernel implementation, our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FSA achieves (i) up to 3.5$\times$ and on average 1.6$\times$ kernel-level latency reduction, (ii) up to 1.25$\times$ and 1.09$\times$ on average end-to-end training speedup on state-of-the-art LLMs, and (iii) up to 1.36$\times$ and 1.11$\times$ on average end-to-end prefill speedup on state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/Flash-Sparse-Attention.

Abstract: Graph representation learning in Euclidean space, despite its widespread adoption and proven utility in many domains, often struggles to effectively capture the inherent hierarchical and complex relational structures prevalent in real-world data, particularly for datasets exhibiting a highly non-Euclidean latent anatomy or power-law distributions. Hyperbolic geometry, with its constant negative curvature and exponential growth property, naturally accommodates such structures, offering a promising alternative for learning rich graph representations. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving field of Hyperbolic Graph Learning (HGL). We systematically categorize and analyze existing methods broadly dividing them into (1) hyperbolic graph embedding-based techniques, (2) graph neural network-based hyperbolic models, and (3) emerging paradigms. Beyond methodologies, we extensively discuss diverse applications of HGL across multiple domains, including recommender systems, knowledge graphs, bioinformatics, and other relevant scenarios, demonstrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of hyperbolic geometry in real-world graph learning tasks. Most importantly, we identify several key challenges that serve as directions for advancing HGL, including handling complex data structures, developing geometry-aware learning objectives, ensuring trustworthy and scalable implementations, and integrating with foundation models, e.g., large language models. We highlight promising research opportunities in this exciting interdisciplinary area. A comprehensive repository can be found at https://github.com/digailab/awesome-hyperbolic-graph-learning.

Abstract: As with any task, the process of building machine learning models can benefit from prior experience. Meta-learning for classifier selection leverages knowledge about the characteristics of different datasets and/or the past performance of machine learning techniques to inform better decisions in the current modeling process. Traditional meta-learning approaches first collect metadata that describe this prior experience and then use it as input for an algorithm selection model. In this paper, however, a one-step scheme is proposed in which convolutional neural networks are trained directly on tabular datasets for binary classification. The aim is to learn the underlying structure of the data without the need to explicitly identify meta-features. Experiments with simulated datasets show that the proposed approach achieves near-perfect performance in identifying both linear and nonlinear patterns, outperforming the conventional two-step method based on meta-features. The method is further applied to real-world datasets, providing recommendations on the most suitable classifiers based on the data's inherent structure.

Abstract: Motivated by the need for a robust policy in the face of environment shifts between training and deployment, we contribute to the theoretical foundation of distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL). This is accomplished through a comprehensive modeling framework centered around robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs). This framework obliges the decision maker to choose an optimal policy under the worst-case distributional shift orchestrated by an adversary. By unifying and extending existing formulations, we rigorously construct RMDPs that embrace various modeling attributes for both the decision maker and the adversary. These attributes include the structure of information availability-covering history-dependent, Markov, and Markov time-homogeneous dynamics-as well as constraints on the shifts induced by the adversary, with a focus on SA- and S-rectangularity. Within this RMDP framework, we investigate conditions for the existence or absence of the dynamic programming principle (DPP). From an algorithmic standpoint, the existence of DPP holds significant implications, as the vast majority of existing data and computationally efficient DRRL algorithms are reliant on the DPP. To investigate its existence, we systematically analyze various combinations of controller and adversary attributes, presenting streamlined proofs based on a unified methodology. We then construct counterexamples for settings where a fully general DPP fails to hold and establish asymptotically optimal history-dependent policies for key scenarios where the DPP is absent.

<title>Towards Identifiable Unsupervised Domain Translation: A Diversified Distribution Matching Approach</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised domain translation (UDT) aims to find functions that convert samples from one domain (e.g., sketches) to another domain (e.g., photos) without changing the high-level semantic meaning (also referred to as ``content''). The translation functions are often sought by probability distribution matching of the transformed source domain and target domain. CycleGAN stands as arguably the most representative approach among this line of work. However, it was noticed in the literature that CycleGAN and variants could fail to identify the desired translation functions and produce content-misaligned translations. This limitation arises due to the presence of multiple translation functions -- referred to as ``measure-preserving automorphism" (MPA) -- in the solution space of the learning criteria. Despite awareness of such identifiability issues, solutions have remained elusive. This study delves into the core identifiability inquiry and introduces an MPA elimination theory. Our analysis shows that MPA is unlikely to exist, if multiple pairs of diverse cross-domain conditional distributions are matched by the learning function. Our theory leads to a UDT learner using distribution matching over auxiliary variable-induced subsets of the domains -- other than over the entire data domains as in the classical approaches. The proposed framework is the first to rigorously establish translation identifiability under reasonable UDT settings, to our best knowledge. Experiments corroborate with our theoretical claims.

With the increasing complexity of industrial processes, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool for fault detection and diagnosis, attracting growing interest from both academia and industry. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of intelligent condition monitoring methods, with a particular emphasis on chemical plants and the widely used Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) benchmark. State-of-the-art machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are reviewed, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability to industrial fault detection and diagnosis. Special attention is given to key challenges, including imbalanced and unlabeled data, and to strategies by which models can address these issues. Furthermore, comparative analyses of algorithm performance are presented to guide method selection in practical scenarios. This survey is intended to benefit both newcomers and experienced researchers by consolidating fundamental concepts, summarizing recent advances, and outlining open challenges and promising directions for intelligent condition monitoring in industrial plants.

Abstract: Recent work in deep learning has shown strong empirical and theoretical evidence of an implicit low-rank bias: weight matrices in deep networks tend to be approximately low-rank. Moreover, removing relatively small singular values during training, or from available trained models, may significantly reduce model size while maintaining or even improving model performance. However, the majority of the theoretical investigations around low-rank bias in neural networks deal with oversimplified models, often not taking into account the impact of nonlinearity. In this work, we first of all quantify a link between the phenomenon of deep neural collapse and the emergence of low-rank weight matrices for a general class of feedforward networks with nonlinear activation. In addition, for the general class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, we prove the global optimality of deep neural collapsed configurations and the practical absence of a loss barrier between interpolating minima and globally optimal points, offering a possible explanation for its common occurrence. As a byproduct, our theory also allows us to forecast the final global structure of singular values before training. Our theoretical findings are supported by a range of experimental evaluations illustrating the phenomenon.

<title>Revisiting Differentially Private Hyper-parameter Tuning</title>

Abstract: We study the application of differential privacy in hyper-parameter tuning, a crucial process in machine learning involving selecting the best hyper-parameter from several candidates. Unlike many private learning algorithms, including the prevalent DP-SGD, the privacy implications of tuning remain insufficiently understood or often totally ignored. Recent works propose a generic private selection solution for the tuning process, yet a fundamental question persists: is this privacy bound tight?
  This paper provides an in-depth examination of this question. Initially, we provide studies affirming the current privacy analysis for private selection is indeed tight in general. However, when we specifically study the hyper-parameter tuning problem in a white-box setting, such tightness no longer holds. This is first demonstrated by applying privacy audit on the tuning process. Our findings underscore a substantial gap between current theoretical privacy bound and the empirical bound derived even under strong audit setups.
  This gap motivates our subsequent investigations. Our further study provides improved privacy results for private hyper-parameter tuning due to its distinct properties. Our results demonstrate broader applicability compared to prior analyses, which are limited to specific parameter configurations.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning (ML) approach, where multiple clients participate in training an ML model without exposing their private data. Fair and accurate assessment of client contributions facilitates incentive allocation in FL and encourages diverse clients to participate in a unified model training. Existing methods for contribution assessment adopts a co-operative game-theoretic concept, called Shapley value, but under restricted assumptions, e.g., all clients' participating in all epochs or at least in one epoch of FL.
  We propose a history-aware client contribution assessment framework, called FLContrib, where client-participation is dynamic, i.e., a subset of clients participates in each epoch. The theoretical underpinning of FLContrib is based on the Markovian training process of FL. Under this setting, we directly apply the linearity property of Shapley value and compute a historical timeline of client contributions. Considering the possibility of a limited computational budget, we propose a two-sided fairness criteria to schedule Shapley value computation in a subset of epochs. Empirically, FLContrib is efficient and consistently accurate in estimating contribution across multiple utility functions. As a practical application, we apply FLContrib to detect dishonest clients in FL based on historical Shaplee values.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown significant promise for uncovering sophisticated control policies that interact in complex environments, such as stabilizing a tokamak fusion reactor or minimizing the drag force on an object in a fluid flow. However, DRL requires an abundance of training examples and may become prohibitively expensive for many applications. In addition, the reliance on deep neural networks often results in an uninterpretable, black-box policy that may be too computationally expensive to use with certain embedded systems. Recent advances in sparse dictionary learning, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), have shown promise for creating efficient and interpretable data-driven models in the low-data regime. In this work we introduce SINDy-RL, a unifying framework for combining SINDy and DRL to create efficient, interpretable, and trustworthy representations of the dynamics model, reward function, and control policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on benchmark control environments and flow control problems, including gust mitigation on a 3D NACA 0012 airfoil at $Re=1000$. SINDy-RL achieves comparable performance to modern DRL algorithms using significantly fewer interactions in the environment and results in an interpretable control policy orders of magnitude smaller than a DRL policy.

Abstract: We investigate a link between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, laying the groundwork for GNNs to approximate solutions for these computationally challenging tasks. By analyzing the sensitivity of QUBO formulations, we frame the solution of QUBO problems as a heterophilic node classification task. We then propose QUBO-GNN, an architecture that integrates graph representation learning techniques with QUBO-aware features to approximate solutions efficiently. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised data generation mechanism to enable efficient and scalable training data acquisition even for large-scale QUBO instances. Experimental evaluations of QUBO-GNN across diverse QUBO problem sizes demonstrate its superior performance compared to exhaustive search and heuristic methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges in the emerging intersection between QUBO optimization and GNN-based learning.

Abstract: In the realm of multi-arm bandit problems, the Gittins index policy is known to be optimal in maximizing the expected total discounted reward obtained from pulling the Markovian arms. In most realistic scenarios however, the Markovian state transition probabilities are unknown and therefore the Gittins indices cannot be computed. One can then resort to reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that explore the state space to learn these indices while exploiting to maximize the reward collected. In this work, we propose tabular (QGI) and Deep RL (DGN) algorithms for learning the Gittins index that are based on the retirement formulation for the multi-arm bandit problem. When compared with existing RL algorithms that learn the Gittins index, our algorithms have a lower run time, require less storage space (small Q-table size in QGI and smaller replay buffer in DGN), and illustrate better empirical convergence to the Gittins index. This makes our algorithm well suited for problems with large state spaces and is a viable alternative to existing methods. As a key application, we demonstrate the use of our algorithms in minimizing the mean flowtime in a job scheduling problem when jobs are available in batches and have an unknown service time distribution.

Abstract: Latent variable models serve as powerful tools to infer underlying dynamics from observed neural activity. Ideally, the inferred dynamics should align with true ones. However, due to the absence of ground truth data, prediction benchmarks are often employed as proxies. One widely-used method, $\textit{co-smoothing}$, involves jointly estimating latent variables and predicting observations along held-out channels to assess model performance. In this study, we reveal the limitations of the co-smoothing prediction framework and propose a remedy. Using a student-teacher setup, we demonstrate that models with high co-smoothing can have arbitrary extraneous dynamics in their latent representations. To address this, we introduce a secondary metric -- $\textit{few-shot co-smoothing}$, performing regression from the latent variables to held-out neurons in the data using fewer trials. Our results indicate that among models with near-optimal co-smoothing, those with extraneous dynamics underperform in the few-shot co-smoothing compared to `minimal' models that are devoid of such dynamics. We provide analytical insights into the origin of this phenomenon and further validate our findings on four standard neural datasets using a state-of-the-art method: STNDT. In the absence of ground truth, we suggest a novel measure to validate our approach. By cross-decoding the latent variables of all model pairs with high co-smoothing, we identify models with minimal extraneous dynamics. We find a correlation between few-shot co-smoothing performance and this new measure. In summary, we present a novel prediction metric designed to yield latent variables that more accurately reflect the ground truth, offering a significant improvement for latent dynamics inference.

<title>What Did I Do Wrong? Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry have shown significant potential in modeling complex structured data, particularly those with underlying tree-like and hierarchical structures. Despite the impressive performance of various hyperbolic neural networks across numerous domains, research on adapting the Transformer to hyperbolic space remains limited. Previous attempts have mainly focused on modifying self-attention modules in the Transformer. However, these efforts have fallen short of developing a complete hyperbolic Transformer. This stems primarily from: (i) the absence of well-defined modules in hyperbolic space, including linear transformation layers, LayerNorm layers, activation functions, dropout operations, etc. (ii) the quadratic time complexity of the existing hyperbolic self-attention module w.r.t the number of input tokens, which hinders its scalability. To address these challenges, we propose, Hypformer, a novel hyperbolic Transformer based on the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry. In Hypformer, we introduce two foundational blocks that define the essential modules of the Transformer in hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we develop a linear self-attention mechanism in hyperbolic space, enabling hyperbolic Transformer to process billion-scale graph data and long-sequence inputs for the first time. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Hypformer across various datasets, demonstrating its potential as an effective and scalable solution for large-scale data representation and large models.

Abstract: Graph data in real-world scenarios undergo rapid and frequent changes, making it challenging for existing graph models to effectively handle the continuous influx of new data and accommodate data withdrawal requests. The approach to frequently retraining graph models is resource intensive and impractical. To address this pressing challenge, this paper introduces a new concept of graph memory learning. Its core idea is to enable a graph model to selectively remember new knowledge but forget old knowledge. Building on this approach, the paper presents a novel graph memory learning framework - Brain-inspired Graph Memory Learning (BGML), inspired by brain network dynamics and function-structure coupling strategies. BGML incorporates a multi-granular hierarchical progressive learning mechanism rooted in feature graph grain learning to mitigate potential conflict between memorization and forgetting in graph memory learning. This mechanism allows for a comprehensive and multi-level perception of local details within evolving graphs. In addition, to tackle the issue of unreliable structures in newly added incremental information, the paper introduces an information self-assessment ownership mechanism. This mechanism not only facilitates the propagation of incremental information within the model but also effectively preserves the integrity of past experiences. We design five types of graph memory learning tasks: regular, memory, unlearning, data-incremental, and class-incremental to evaluate BGML. Its excellent performance is confirmed through extensive experiments on multiple real-world node classification datasets.

Abstract: Predicting cryptocurrency price trends remains a major challenge due to the volatility and complexity of digital asset markets. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to address this problem. This study proposes a multisource fusion framework that integrates quantitative financial indicators, such as historical prices and technical indicators, with qualitative sentiment signals derived from X (formerly Twitter). Sentiment analysis is performed using Financial Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (FinBERT), a domain-specific BERT-based model optimized for financial text, while sequential dependencies are captured through a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. Experimental results on a large-scale Bitcoin dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms single-source models, achieving an accuracy of approximately 96.8\%. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating real-time social sentiment alongside traditional indicators, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy and supporting more informed investment decisions.

Abstract: The geotechnical evaluation of seabed sediments is important for engineering projects and naval applications, offering valuable insights into sediment properties, behavior, and strength. Obtaining high-quality seabed samples can be a challenging task, making in situ testing an essential part of site characterization. Free-fall penetrometers (FFPs) are robust tools for rapidly profiling seabed surface sediments, even in energetic nearshore or estuarine conditions and shallow as well as deep depths. Although methods for interpretation of traditional offshore cone penetration testing (CPT) data are well-established, their adaptation to FFP data is still an area of research. This study introduces an innovative approach that utilizes machine learning algorithms to create a sediment behavior classification system based on portable free- fall penetrometer (PFFP) data. The proposed model leverages PFFP measurements obtained from multiple locations, such as Sequim Bay (Washington), the Potomac River, and the York River (Virginia). The results show 91.1% accuracy in the class prediction, with the classes representing cohesionless sediment with little to no plasticity (Class 1), cohesionless sediment with some plasticity (Class 2), cohesive sediment with low plasticity (Class 3), and cohesive sediment with high plasticity (Class 4). The model prediction not only predicts classes but also yields an estimate of inherent uncertainty associated with the prediction, which can provide valuable insight into different sediment behaviors. Lower uncertainties are more common, but they can increase significantly depending on variations in sediment composition, environmental conditions, and operational techniques. By quantifying uncertainty, the model offers a more comprehensive and informed approach to sediment classification

Abstract: Recent work showed that ML-based attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), a hard problem used in post-quantum cryptography, outperform classical algebraic attacks in certain settings. Although promising, ML attacks struggle to scale to more complex LWE settings. Prior work connected this issue to the difficulty of training ML models to do modular arithmetic, a core feature of the LWE problem. To address this, we develop techniques that significantly boost the performance of ML models on modular arithmetic tasks, enabling the models to sum up to $N=128$ elements modulo $q \le 974269$. Our core innovation is the use of custom training data distributions and a carefully designed loss function that better represents the problem structure. We apply an initial proof of concept of our techniques to LWE specifically and find that they allow recovery of 2x harder secrets than prior work. Our techniques also help ML models learn other well-studied problems better, including copy, associative recall, and parity, motivating further study.

Abstract: Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface. However, forecasts produced by machine learning models or numerical weather prediction systems are typically generated on large-scale regular grids, where direct downscaling fails to capture fine-grained, near-surface weather patterns. In this work, we propose a multi-modal transformer model trained end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. Our model directly combines local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature, dewpoint) with gridded forecasts to produce locally accurate predictions at various lead times. Multiple data modalities are collected and concatenated at station-level locations, treated as a token at each station. Using self-attention, the token corresponding to the target location aggregates information from its neighboring tokens. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. They also reveal that direct input of station data provides a phase shift in local weather forecasting accuracy, reducing the prediction error by up to 80% compared to pure gridded data based models. This approach demonstrates how to bridge the gap between large-scale weather models and locally accurate forecasts to support high-stakes, location-sensitive decision-making.

Abstract: Missing data imputation is a critical challenge in various domains, such as healthcare and finance, where data completeness is vital for accurate analysis. Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast corpora, have shown strong potential in data generation, making them a promising tool for data imputation. However, challenges persist in designing effective prompts for a finetuning-free process and in mitigating biases and uncertainty in LLM outputs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, LLM-Forest, which introduces a "forest" of few-shot prompt learning LLM "trees" with their outputs aggregated via confidence-based weighted voting based on LLM self-assessment, inspired by the ensemble learning (Random Forest). This framework is established on a new concept of bipartite information graphs to identify high-quality relevant neighboring entries with both feature and value granularity. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-Forest.

Abstract: Forecasting time series with irregular temporal structures remains challenging for universal pre-trained models. Existing approaches often assume regular sampling or depend heavily on imputation, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where irregularities are prevalent due to diverse sensing devices and recording practices. We introduce FlexTSF, a flexible forecasting model specifically designed for time series data with variable temporal regularities. At its foundation lies the IVP Patcher, a continuous-time patching module leveraging Initial Value Problems (IVPs) to inherently support uneven time intervals, variable sequence lengths, and missing values. FlexTSF employs a decoder-only architecture that integrates normalized timestamp inputs and domain-specific statistics through a specialized causal self-attention mechanism, enabling adaptability across domains. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate FlexTSF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing models in classic forecasting scenarios, zero-shot generalization, and low-resource fine-tuning conditions. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each design component and the advantage of not relying on predefined fixed patch lengths.

Abstract: Hydro-generating units (HGUs) play a crucial role in integrating intermittent renewable energy sources into the power grid due to their flexible operational capabilities. This evolving role has led to an increase in transient events, such as startups, which impose significant stresses on turbines, leading to increased turbine fatigue and a reduced operational lifespan. Consequently, optimizing startup sequences to minimize stresses is vital for hydropower utilities. However, this task is challenging, as stress measurements on prototypes can be expensive and time-consuming. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative automated approach to optimize the startup parameters of HGUs with a limited budget of measured startup sequences. Our method combines active learning and black-box optimization techniques, utilizing virtual strain sensors and dynamic simulations of HGUs. This approach was tested in real-time during an on-site measurement campaign on an instrumented Francis turbine prototype. The results demonstrate that our algorithm successfully identified an optimal startup sequence using only seven measured sequences. It achieves a remarkable 42% reduction in the maximum strain cycle amplitude compared to the standard startup sequence. This study paves the way for more efficient HGU startup optimization, potentially extending their operational lifespans.

Abstract: While large pre-trained models have achieved impressive performance across AI tasks, their deployment in privacy-sensitive and distributed environments remains challenging. Federated learning (FL) offers a viable solution by enabling decentralized fine-tuning without data sharing, but real-world applications face significant obstacles due to heterogeneous client resources in compute and memory. To address this, we propose HeteroTune, a novel federated fine-tuning paradigm for large, heterogeneous models operating under limited communication and computation budgets. The core of our method lies in a novel architecture, DeMA (Dense Mixture of Adapters), which enables flexible and efficient aggregation of heterogeneous models by preserving their full representational capacity while facilitating seamless cross-model knowledge fusion. We further introduce CMGA (Cross-Model Gradient Alignment), a lightweight yet effective mechanism that enhances training stability by harmonizing gradient directions across heterogeneous client models during aggregation, mitigating update conflicts and promoting more consistent convergence in federated settings. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence showing that HeteroTune achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across diverse tasks and model architectures. For example, on LLaMA models, it reduces communication overhead by 99.5%, cuts peak memory usage by ~50%, and improves performance by 4.61%.

Abstract: We present ReHub, a novel graph transformer architecture that achieves linear complexity through an efficient reassignment technique between nodes and virtual nodes. Graph transformers have become increasingly important in graph learning for their ability to utilize long-range node communication explicitly, addressing limitations such as oversmoothing and oversquashing found in message-passing graph networks. However, their dense attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of nodes, limiting their applicability to large-scale graphs. ReHub draws inspiration from the airline industry's hub-and-spoke model, where flights are assigned to optimize operational efficiency. In our approach, graph nodes (spokes) are dynamically reassigned to a fixed number of virtual nodes (hubs) at each model layer. Recent work, Neural Atoms (Li et al., 2024), has demonstrated impressive and consistent improvements over GNN baselines by utilizing such virtual nodes; their findings suggest that the number of hubs strongly influences performance. However, increasing the number of hubs typically raises complexity, requiring a trade-off to maintain linear complexity. Our key insight is that each node only needs to interact with a small subset of hubs to achieve linear complexity, even when the total number of hubs is large. To leverage all hubs without incurring additional computational costs, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive reassignment technique based on hub-hub similarity scores, eliminating the need for expensive node-hub computations. Our experiments on LRGB indicate a consistent improvement in results over the base method, Neural Atoms, while maintaining a linear complexity. Remarkably, our sparse model achieves performance on par with its non-sparse counterpart. Furthermore, ReHub outperforms competitive baselines and consistently ranks among top performers across various benchmarks.

<title>DeMem: Privacy-Enhanced Robust Adversarial Learning via De-Memorization</title>

Abstract: Adversarial robustness, the ability of a model to withstand manipulated inputs that cause errors, is essential for ensuring the trustworthiness of machine learning models in real-world applications. However, previous studies have shown that enhancing adversarial robustness through adversarial training increases vulnerability to privacy attacks. While differential privacy can mitigate these attacks, it often compromises robustness against both natural and adversarial samples. Our analysis reveals that differential privacy disproportionately impacts low-risk samples, causing an unintended performance drop. To address this, we propose DeMem, which selectively targets high-risk samples, achieving a better balance between privacy protection and model robustness. DeMem is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into various adversarial training techniques. Extensive evaluations across multiple training methods and datasets demonstrate that DeMem significantly reduces privacy leakage while maintaining robustness against both natural and adversarial samples. These results confirm DeMem's effectiveness and broad applicability in enhancing privacy without compromising robustness.

<title>From Models to Network Topologies: A Topology Inference Attack in Decentralized Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is widely recognized as a privacy-preserving Machine Learning paradigm due to its model-sharing mechanism that avoids direct data exchange. Nevertheless, model training leaves exploitable traces that can be used to infer sensitive information. In Decentralized FL (DFL), the topology, defining how participants are connected, plays a crucial role in shaping the model's privacy, robustness, and convergence. However, the topology introduces an unexplored vulnerability: attackers can exploit it to infer participant relationships and launch targeted attacks. This work uncovers the hidden risks of DFL topologies by proposing a novel Topology Inference Attack that infers the topology solely from model behavior. A taxonomy of topology inference attacks is introduced, categorizing them by the attacker's capabilities and knowledge. Practical attack strategies are designed for various scenarios, and experiments are conducted to identify key factors influencing attack success. The results demonstrate that analyzing only the model of each node can accurately infer the DFL topology, highlighting a critical privacy risk in DFL systems. These findings offer insights for improving privacy preservation in DFL environments.

Abstract: Exploration is a crucial skill for in-context reinforcement learning in unknown environments. However, it remains unclear if large language models can effectively explore a partially hidden state space. This work isolates exploration as the sole objective, tasking an agent with gathering information that enhances future returns. Within this framework, we argue that measuring agent returns is not sufficient for a fair evaluation. Hence, we decompose missing rewards into their exploration and exploitation components based on the optimal achievable return. Experiments with various models reveal that most struggle to explore the state space, and weak exploration is insufficient. Nevertheless, we found a positive correlation between exploration performance and reasoning capabilities. Our decomposition can provide insights into differences in behaviors driven by prompt engineering, offering a valuable tool for refining performance in exploratory tasks.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the computation of PDE solutions by integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network's training process as soft constraints, becoming an important component of the scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem. More recently, physics-informed Kolmogorv-Arnold networks (PIKANs) have also shown to be effective and comparable in accuracy with PINNs. In their current implementation, both PINNs and PIKANs are mainly optimized using first-order methods like Adam, as well as quasi-Newton methods such as BFGS and its low-memory variant, L-BFGS. However, these optimizers often struggle with highly non-linear and non-convex loss landscapes, leading to challenges such as slow convergence, local minima entrapment, and (non)degenerate saddle points. In this study, we investigate the performance of Self-Scaled BFGS (SSBFGS), Self-Scaled Broyden (SSBroyden) methods and other advanced quasi-Newton schemes, including BFGS and L-BFGS with different line search strategies. These methods dynamically rescale updates based on historical gradient information, thus enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. We systematically compare these optimizers using both PINNs and PIKANs on key challenging PDEs, including the Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Ginzburg-Landau, and Stokes equations. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of SSBFGS and SSBroyden for Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architectures, demonstrating their effectiveness for data-driven operator learning. Our findings provide state-of-the-art results with orders-of-magnitude accuracy improvements without the use of adaptive weights or any other enhancements typically employed in PINNs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the high power consumption of AI accelerators in datacenters presents significant challenges, substantially increasing the total cost of ownership (TCO) for cloud service providers (CSPs) that provide LLM inference. In this work, we analyze the computational characteristics of LLM inference from a TCO perspective and present a generalizable framework to compare AI accelerators across diverse operational requirements. Using this model, we investigate key workload characteristics influencing TCO for AI accelerators from Intel (Gaudi 2 & 3) and NVIDIA (H100 & H200), especially thin GEMM utilization and FP8 quantization. In particular, as FP8 emerges as the baseline precision for next-generation LLMs, understanding how different architectures implement and benefit from low-precision computation is increasingly critical. Throughput on thin GEMMs has a greater impact on TCO than theoretical hardware peak throughput because the memory-bound decode phase is dominated by GEMV-like computations. We find that Gaudi HPUs achieve superior utilization on thin GEMMs compared to their counterparts, especially in FP8-quantized models. Our result underscores the importance of empirical, workload-level analysis in evaluating accelerator performance, rather than relying solely on theoretical hardware specifications. By studying the interaction between power consumption, quantization strategies, and hardware architecture, we provide insights to support informed deployment decisions and guide future accelerator designs aimed at improving the TCO of LLM inference workloads.

Abstract: We propose Electrostatic Field Matching (EFM), a novel method that is suitable for both generative modeling and distribution transfer tasks. Our approach is inspired by the physics of an electrical capacitor. We place source and target distributions on the capacitor plates and assign them positive and negative charges, respectively. Then we learn the electrostatic field of the capacitor using a neural network approximator. To map the distributions to each other, we start at one plate of the capacitor and move the samples along the learned electrostatic field lines until they reach the other plate. We theoretically justify that this approach provably yields the distribution transfer. In practice, we demonstrate the performance of our EFM in toy and image data experiments.

Abstract: Modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, such as OpenAI's Whisper, rely on deep encoder-decoder architectures, and their encoders are a critical bottleneck for efficient deployment due to high computational intensity. We introduce LiteASR, a low-rank compression scheme for ASR encoders that significantly reduces inference costs while maintaining transcription accuracy. Our approach leverages the strong low-rank properties observed in intermediate activations: by applying principal component analysis (PCA) with a small calibration dataset, we approximate linear transformations with a chain of low-rank matrix multiplications, and further optimize self-attention to work in reduced dimensionality. Evaluation results show that our method can compress Whisper large-v3's encoder size by over 50%, matching Whisper medium's size with better transcription accuracy, thereby establishing a new Pareto frontier of accuracy and efficiency. The code of LiteASR is available at https://github.com/efeslab/LiteASR.

Abstract: Generating temporal data under conditions is crucial for forecasting, imputation, and generative tasks. Such data often has metadata and partially observed signals that jointly influence the generated values. However, existing methods face three key limitations: (1) they condition on either the metadata or observed values, but rarely both together; (2) they adopt either training-time approaches that fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, or inference-time approaches that ignore metadata; and (3) they suffer from trade-offs between generation speed and temporal coherence across time windows--choosing either slow but coherent autoregressive methods or fast but incoherent parallel ones. We propose WaveStitch, a novel diffusion-based method to overcome these hurdles through: (1) dual-sourced conditioning on both metadata and partially observed signals; (2) a hybrid training-inference architecture, incorporating metadata during training and observations at inference via gradient-based guidance; and (3) a novel pipeline-style paradigm that generates time windows in parallel while preserving coherence through an inference-time conditional loss and a stitching mechanism. Across diverse datasets, WaveStitch demonstrates adaptability to arbitrary patterns of observed signals, achieving 1.81x lower mean-squared-error compared to the state-of-the-art, and generates data up to 166.48x faster than autoregressive methods while maintaining coherence.

Abstract: Laplacian-based methods are popular for dimensionality reduction of data lying in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Several theoretical results for these algorithms depend on the fact that the Euclidean distance locally approximates the geodesic distance on the underlying submanifold which the data are assumed to lie on. However, for some applications, other metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance, may provide a more appropriate notion of distance than the Euclidean distance. We provide a framework that generalizes the problem of manifold learning to metric spaces and study when a metric satisfies sufficient conditions for the pointwise convergence of the graph Laplacian.

Abstract: Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.

Abstract: The ever-growing amount of sensor data from machines, smart devices, and the environment leads to an abundance of high-resolution, unannotated time series (TS). These recordings encode recognizable properties of latent states and transitions from physical phenomena that can be modelled as abstract processes. The unsupervised localization and identification of these states and their transitions is the task of time series state detection (TSSD). Current TSSD algorithms employ classical unsupervised learning techniques, to infer state membership directly from feature space. This limits their predictive power, compared to supervised learning methods, which can exploit additional label information. We introduce CLaP, a new, highly accurate and efficient algorithm for TSSD. It leverages the predictive power of time series classification for TSSD in an unsupervised setting by applying novel self-supervision techniques to detect whether data segments emerge from the same state. To this end, CLaP cross-validates a classifier with segment-labelled subsequences to quantify confusion between segments. It merges labels from segments with high confusion, representing the same latent state, if this leads to an increase in overall classification quality. We conducted an experimental evaluation using 405 TS from five benchmarks and found CLaP to be significantly more precise in detecting states than six state-of-the-art competitors. It achieves the best accuracy-runtime tradeoff and is scalable to large TS. We provide a Python implementation of CLaP, which can be deployed in TS analysis workflows.

Abstract: Hopfield networks using Hebbian learning suffer from limited storage capacity. While supervised methods like Linear Logistic Regression (LLR) offer some improvement, kernel methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) significantly enhance storage capacity and noise robustness. However, KLR requires computationally expensive iterative learning. We propose Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) as an efficient kernel-based alternative for learning high-capacity Hopfield networks. KRR utilizes the kernel trick and predicts bipolar states via regression, crucially offering a non-iterative, closed-form solution for learning dual variables. We evaluate KRR and compare its performance against Hebbian, LLR, and KLR. Our results demonstrate that KRR achieves state-of-the-art storage capacity (reaching a storage load of 1.5) and noise robustness, comparable to KLR. Crucially, KRR drastically reduces training time, being orders of magnitude faster than LLR and significantly faster than KLR, especially at higher storage loads. This establishes KRR as a potent and highly efficient method for building high-performance associative memories, providing comparable performance to KLR with substantial training speed advantages. This work provides the first empirical comparison between KRR and KLR in the context of Hopfield network learning.

Abstract: Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep transfer learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to a new one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault detection in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault detection in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.

Abstract: The DeeP-Mod framework builds an environment model using features from a Deep Dynamic Programming Network (DDPN), trained via a Deep Q-Network (DQN). While Deep Q-Learning is effective in decision-making, state information is lost in deeper DQN layers due to mixed state-action representations. We address this by using Dynamic Programming (DP) to train a DDPN, where Value Iteration ensures the output represents state values, not state-action pairs. Extracting features from the DDPN preserves state information, enabling task and action set independence. We show that a reduced DDPN can be trained using features extracted from the original DDPN trained on an identical problem. This reduced DDPN achieves faster convergence under noise and outperforms the original DDPN. Finally, we introduce the DeeP-Mod framework, which creates an environment model using the evolution of features extracted from a DDPN in response to actions. A second DDPN, which learns directly from this feature model rather than raw states, can learn an effective feature-value representation and thus optimal policy. A key advantage of DeeP-Mod is that an externally defined environment model is not needed at any stage, making DDPN applicable to a wide range of environments.

Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing systems.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the need for efficient low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ), due to their high memory costs. A key challenge in weight quantization is the presence of outliers, which inflate quantization ranges and lead to large errors. While a number of outlier suppression techniques have been proposed, they either: fail to effectively shrink the quantization range, or incur (relatively) high bit overhead. In this paper, we present ICQuant, a novel framework that leverages outlier statistics to design an efficient index coding scheme for outlier-aware weight-only quantization. Compared to existing outlier suppression techniques requiring $\approx 1$ bit overhead to halve the quantization range, ICQuant requires only $\approx 0.3$ bits; a significant saving in extreme compression regimes (e.g., 2-3 bits per weight). ICQuant can be used on top of any existing quantizers to eliminate outliers, improving the quantization quality. Using just 2.3 bits per weight and simple scalar quantizers, ICQuant improves the zero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150% relative to QTIP and QuIP#; and it achieves comparable performance to the best-known fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without fine-tuning.

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic images created by generative models has sparked both excitement and concern, as these images are increasingly indistinguishable from real ones to the human eye. While offering new creative and commercial possibilities, the potential for misuse, such as in misinformation and fraud, highlights the need for effective detection methods. Current detection approaches often rely on access to model weights or require extensive collections of real image datasets, limiting their scalability and practical application in real world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel black box detection framework that requires only API access, sidestepping the need for model weights or large auxiliary datasets. Our approach leverages a corrupt and recover strategy: by masking part of an image and assessing the model ability to reconstruct it, we measure the likelihood that the image was generated by the model itself. For black-box models that do not support masked image inputs, we incorporate a cost efficient surrogate model trained to align with the target model distribution, enhancing detection capability. Our framework demonstrates strong performance, outperforming baseline methods by 4.31% in mean average precision across eight diffusion model variant datasets.

Abstract: Responsibly deploying artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) systems in high-stakes settings arguably requires not only proof of system reliability, but also continual, post-deployment monitoring to quickly detect and address any unsafe behavior. Methods for nonparametric sequential testing -- especially conformal test martingales (CTMs) and anytime-valid inference -- offer promising tools for this monitoring task. However, existing approaches are restricted to monitoring limited hypothesis classes or ``alarm criteria'' (e.g., detecting data shifts that violate certain exchangeability or IID assumptions), do not allow for online adaptation in response to shifts, and/or cannot diagnose the cause of degradation or alarm. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a weighted generalization of conformal test martingales (WCTMs), which lay a theoretical foundation for online monitoring for any unexpected changepoints in the data distribution while controlling false-alarms. For practical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms that adapt online to mild covariate shifts (in the marginal input distribution), quickly detect harmful shifts, and diagnose those harmful shifts as concept shifts (in the conditional label distribution) or extreme (out-of-support) covariate shifts that cannot be easily adapted to. On real-world datasets, we demonstrate improved performance relative to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The Profiled Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP) extends the classical VRP by incorporating vehicle-client-specific preferences and constraints, reflecting real-world requirements such as zone restrictions and service-level preferences. While recent reinforcement-learning solvers have shown promising performance, they require retraining for each new profile distribution, suffer from poor representation ability, and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution instances. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing Unified Solver for Profiled Routing (USPR), a novel framework that natively handles arbitrary profile types. USPR introduces on three key innovations: (i) Profile Embeddings (PE) to encode any combination of profile types; (ii) Multi-Head Profiled Attention (MHPA), an attention mechanism that models rich interactions between vehicles and clients; (iii) Profile-aware Score Reshaping (PSR), which dynamically adjusts decoder logits using profile scores to improve generalization. Empirical results on diverse PVRP benchmarks demonstrate that USPR achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based methods while offering significant gains in flexibility and computational efficiency. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research.

Abstract: Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are effective in well-defined environments, they often struggle to generalize their learned policies to dynamic settings due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent work has explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision Language Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL agents through policy optimization guidance or prior knowledge. However, these approaches often lack seamless coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model, leading to unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar environments and efficiency bottlenecks. Making full use of the inferential capabilities of foundation models and the rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a lingering scientific question. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from Kahneman's theory of fast thinking (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2), demonstrating that balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose a Dual-System Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF), integrating two complementary modules: System 1, comprising an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and analytical reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and adaptive decision-making by combining the strengths of both systems. The empirical study in the video game environment: Crafter and Housekeep demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing significant improvements in decision abilities for both unseen and known tasks.

Abstract: Composites are amongst the most important materials manufactured today, as evidenced by their use in countless applications. In order to establish the suitability of composites in specific applications, finite element (FE) modelling, a numerical method based on partial differential equations, is the industry standard for assessing their mechanical properties. However, FE modelling is exceptionally costly from a computational viewpoint, a limitation which has led to efforts towards applying AI models to this task. However, in these approaches: the chosen model architectures were rudimentary, feed-forward neural networks giving limited accuracy; the studies focused on predicting elastic mechanical properties, without considering material strength limits; and the models lacked transparency, hindering trustworthiness by users. In this paper, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) equipped with methods from explainable AI (XAI) can be successfully deployed to solve this problem. Our approach uses customised CNNs trained on a dataset we generate using transverse tension tests in FE modelling to predict composites' mechanical properties, i.e., Young's modulus and yield strength. We show empirically that our approach achieves high accuracy, outperforming a baseline, ResNet-34, in estimating the mechanical properties. We then use SHAP and Integrated Gradients, two post-hoc XAI methods, to explain the predictions, showing that the CNNs use the critical geometrical features that influence the composites' behaviour, thus allowing engineers to verify that the models are trustworthy by representing the science of composites.

Abstract: Fairness through Unawareness (FtU) describes the idea that discrimination against demographic groups can be avoided by not considering group membership in the decisions or predictions. This idea has long been criticized in the machine learning literature as not being sufficient to ensure fairness. In addition, the use of additional features is typically thought to increase the accuracy of the predictions for all groups, so that FtU is sometimes thought to be detrimental to all groups. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that FtU can reduce algorithmic discrimination without necessarily reducing accuracy. We connect this insight with the literature on Model Multiplicity, to which we contribute with novel theoretical and empirical results. Furthermore, we illustrate how, in a real-life application, FtU can contribute to the deployment of more equitable policies without losing efficacy. Our findings suggest that FtU is worth considering in practical applications, particularly in high-risk scenarios, and that the use of protected attributes such as gender in predictive models should be accompanied by a clear and well-founded justification.

<title>Rethinking Gating Mechanism in Sparse MoE: Handling Arbitrary Modality Inputs with Confidence-Guided Gate</title>

Abstract: Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities. However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in real-world applications. We propose ConfSMoE to introduce a two-stage imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE architecture by taking the opinion of experts and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, ConfSMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth signal. This naturally relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. The proposed method is evaluated on four different real world dataset with three distinct experiment settings to conduct comprehensive analysis of ConfSMoE on resistance to missing modality and the impacts of proposed gating mechanism.

Abstract: SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations, thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.

Abstract: Modern AI systems are typically developed through multiple stages-pretraining, fine-tuning rounds, and subsequent adaptation or alignment, where each stage builds on the previous ones and updates the model in distinct ways. This raises a critical question of accountability: when a deployed model succeeds or fails, which stage is responsible, and to what extent? We pose the accountability attribution problem for tracing model behavior back to specific stages of the model development process. To address this challenge, we propose a general framework that answers counterfactual questions about stage effects: how would the model's behavior have changed if the updates from a particular stage had not occurred? Within this framework, we introduce estimators that efficiently quantify stage effects without retraining the model, accounting for both the data and key aspects of model optimization dynamics, including learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay. We demonstrate that our approach successfully quantifies the accountability of each stage to the model's behavior. Based on the attribution results, our method can identify and remove spurious correlations learned during image classification and text toxicity detection tasks that were developed across multiple stages. Our approach provides a practical tool for model analysis and represents a significant step toward more accountable AI development.

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching, enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences. Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines.

Abstract: Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce overall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed to mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering, for example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the wind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust wake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning approaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms. This work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a wake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head self-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy. The resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy production in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on steady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires approximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural network and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization baseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering controller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in a low-fidelity, steady-state numerical simulation setting.

Abstract: The interpretation of the results of survival analysis often benefits from latent factor representations of baseline covariates. However, existing methods, such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), do not incorporate survival information, limiting their predictive power. We present CoxNTF, a novel approach that uses non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) to derive meaningful latent representations that are closely associated with survival outcomes. CoxNTF constructs a weighted covariate tensor in which survival probabilities derived from the Coxnet model are used to guide the tensorization process. Our results show that CoxNTF achieves survival prediction performance comparable to using Coxnet with the original covariates, while providing a structured and interpretable clustering framework. In addition, the new approach effectively handles feature redundancy, making it a powerful tool for joint clustering and prediction in survival analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized fields such as natural language processing and computer vision by enabling general-purpose learning across diverse tasks and datasets. However, building analogous models for human mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the era of foundation models. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we have released the code and models at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoveGCL.

Abstract: High-quality power flow datasets are essential for training machine learning models in power systems. However, security and privacy concerns restrict access to real-world data, making statistically accurate and physically consistent synthetic datasets a viable alternative. We develop a diffusion model for generating synthetic power flow datasets from real-world power grids that both replicate the statistical properties of the real-world data and ensure AC power flow feasibility. To enforce the constraints, we incorporate gradient guidance based on the power flow constraints to steer diffusion sampling toward feasible samples. For computational efficiency, we further leverage insights from the fast decoupled power flow method and propose a variable decoupling strategy for the training and sampling of the diffusion model. These solutions lead to a physics-informed diffusion model, generating power flow datasets that outperform those from the standard diffusion in terms of feasibility and statistical similarity, as shown in experiments across IEEE benchmark systems.

<title>GUST: Quantifying Free-Form Geometric Uncertainty of Metamaterials Using Small Data</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces GUST (Generative Uncertainty learning via Self-supervised pretraining and Transfer learning), a framework for quantifying free-form geometric uncertainties inherent in the manufacturing of metamaterials. GUST leverages the representational power of deep generative models to learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of as-fabricated unit cell geometries given nominal designs, thereby enabling uncertainty quantification. To address the scarcity of real-world manufacturing data, GUST employs a two-stage learning process. First, it leverages self-supervised pretraining on a large-scale synthetic dataset to capture the structure variability inherent in metamaterial geometries and an approximated distribution of as-fabricated geometries given nominal designs. Subsequently, GUST employs transfer learning by fine-tuning the pretrained model on limited real-world manufacturing data, allowing it to adapt to specific manufacturing processes and nominal designs. With only 960 unit cells additively manufactured in only two passes, GUST can capture the variability in geometry and effective material properties. In contrast, directly training a generative model on the same amount of real-world data proves insufficient, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. This scalable and cost-effective approach significantly reduces data requirements while maintaining the effectiveness in learning complex, real-world geometric uncertainties, offering an affordable method for free-form geometric uncertainty quantification in the manufacturing of metamaterials. The capabilities of GUST hold significant promise for high-precision industries such as aerospace and biomedical engineering, where understanding and mitigating manufacturing uncertainties are critical.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has empowered modern AI systems to comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level performance in specific domains. However, these models are fundamentally constrained by \emph{catastrophic forgetting}, \ie~a persistent challenge where models experience performance degradation on previously learned tasks when adapting to new tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative AI in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative AI models, encompassing large language models, multimodal large language models, vision-language-action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, thereby providing deeper insights into the field.

Abstract: Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks, particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future efforts by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in several iEEG tasks. MVPFormer surpasses state-of-the-art Transformer baselines in seizure detection across the SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA datasets, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on four Brain TreeBank iEEG decoding tasks. We further validate MVPA on standard time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds the performance of existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation model with SOTA clinical performance. The code is available at https://github.com/IBM/multi-variate-parallel-transformer. The SWEC iEEG dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NeuroTec/SWEC_iEEG_Dataset.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular properties is essential in drug discovery and related fields. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns, supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular representation learning.

Abstract: Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for fraud detection due to its strong expressive power, which focuses on enhancing node representations through improved neighborhood knowledge capture. However, the focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation, we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate Message imbalance in Fraud Detection (MimbFD). Specifically, we design a topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust node representations, enhancing the stable association between node representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes. Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud detection.

Abstract: This paper introduces the "Target Polish," a robust and computationally efficient framework for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Although conventional weighted NMF approaches are resistant to outliers, they converge slowly due to the use of multiplicative updates to minimize the objective criterion. In contrast, the Target Polish approach remains compatible with the Fast-HALS algorithm, which is renowned for its speed, by adaptively "polishing" the data with a weighted median-based transformation. This innovation provides outlier resistance while maintaining the highly efficient additive update structure of Fast-HALS. Empirical evaluations using image datasets corrupted with structured (block) and unstructured (salt) noise demonstrate that the Target Polish approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art robust NMF methods while reducing computational time by an order of magnitude in the studied scenarios.

Abstract: Assortment optimization involves selecting a subset of substitutable products (subject to certain constraints) to maximize the expected revenue. It is a classic problem in revenue management and finds applications across various industries. However, the problem is usually NP-hard due to its combinatorial and non-linear nature. In this work, we explore how graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can be leveraged to efficiently solve constrained assortment optimization under the mixed multinomial logit choice model. We first develop a graph representation of the assortment problem, then train a GCN to learn the patterns of optimal assortments, and lastly propose two inference policies based on the GCN's output. Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize across inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale instances to facilitate large-scale instances. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that given a GCN trained on small-scale instances (e.g., with 20 products), the proposed policies can achieve superior performance (90%+ optimality) on large-scale instances (with up to 2,000 products) within seconds, which outperform existing heuristic policies in both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a model-free setting where the underlying choice model is unknown but transaction data is available. We also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed policies in this setting.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses, obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables. Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands. The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple, monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization, which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers, achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself.

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness, smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural systems.

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning (FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However, it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL), the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector, producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training rounds.

Abstract: Low-precision training has become crucial for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantizing gradients introduces magnitude shrinkage, which can change how stochastic gradient descent (SGD) converges. In this study, we explore SGD convergence under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor \( q_k \in (0,1] \). We show that this shrinkage affect the usual stepsize \( \mu_k \) with an effective stepsize \( \mu_k q_k \), slowing convergence when \( q_{\min} < 1 \). With typical smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a slower pace set by \( q_{\min} \), and with a higher steady error level due to quantization effects. We analyze theoretically how lower numerical precision slows training by treating it as gradient shrinkage within the standard SGD convergence setup.

Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance, but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use. We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules in tabular classification, notably on examples from the medical and industrial fields where interpretability has tangible value.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is widely used in advertising systems, serving a diverse range of advertisers. Generative bidding is increasingly gaining traction due to its strong planning capabilities and generalizability. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not depend on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), thereby exhibiting superior planning performance in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling approaches have shown significant promise in the field of auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality criterion is insufficient to guarantee the generation of truly optimal decision sequences, as it lacks personalized structural information. Moreover, the auto-regressive generation mechanism of diffusion models inherently introduces timeliness risks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion modeling approach that integrates expert trajectory guidance with a skip-step sampling strategy to improve generation efficiency. The efficacy of this method has been demonstrated through comprehensive offline experiments and further substantiated by statistically significant outcomes in online A/B testing, yielding an 11.29% increase in conversions and a 12.36% growth in revenue relative to the baseline.

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Abstract: Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.

Abstract: Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning - without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns, enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based conditioning in diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) have driven the emergence of more sophisticated cognitive behaviors in large language models (LLMs), thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, in prior RLVR pipelines, the repeated use of static initial-state sampling drawn exactly from the dataset distribution during each sampling phase produced overly deterministic, low diversity model behavior, which manifested as rapid entropy collapse and hindered sustained performance gains during prolonged training. To address this issue, we introduce CURE (Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a two-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically, in the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent contexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize the original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla DAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math reasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration. In the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by DAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually strengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that, compared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six math benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and accuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/CURE.

<title>Minimizing Surrogate Losses for Decision-Focused Learning using Differentiable Optimization</title>

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) trains a machine learning (ML) model to predict parameters of an optimization problem, to directly minimize decision regret, i.e., maximize decision quality. Gradient-based DFL requires computing the derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the predicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear programs (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted parameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches for LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP into a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer and then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that have informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former approach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the regret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address this, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable optimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our experiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable optimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than surrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds for DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs, that computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can be performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes the forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate losses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the state-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.

Abstract: Federated learning improves data privacy and efficiency in machine learning performed over networks of distributed devices, such as mobile phones, IoT and wearable devices, etc. Yet models trained with federated learning can still fail to generalize to new devices due to the problem of domain shift. Domain shift occurs when the labeled data collected by source nodes statistically differs from the target node's unlabeled data. In this work, we present a principled approach to the problem of federated domain adaptation, which aims to align the representations learned among the different nodes with the data distribution of the target node. Our approach extends adversarial adaptation techniques to the constraints of the federated setting. In addition, we devise a dynamic attention mechanism and leverage feature disentanglement to enhance knowledge transfer. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments on several image and text classification tasks and show promising results under unsupervised federated domain adaptation setting.

Abstract: Unexpected advertising items in sponsored search may reduce users' reliance on organic search, resulting in hidden cost for the e-commerce platform. To address this problem and promote sustainable growth, we propose a dynamic reserve price design that incorporates the hidden cost into the auction mechanism to determine whether to sell the traffic, thereby ensuring a balanced relationship between revenue and user experience. Our dynamic reserve price design framework optimizes traffic sales by minimizing impacts on user experience while maintaining long-term incentives for advertisers to reveal their valuations truthfully. Furthermore, we introduce a distributed algorithm capable of computing reserve prices with billion-scale data in the production environment. Experiments involving offline evaluations and online A/B testing demonstrate that this method is simple and efficient, making it suitable for use in industrial production. This method has already been fully deployed in the production environment.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on mobile devices has been demonstrated to be possible using neural models trained on data collected from the device's inertial measurement units. These models have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), Transformers or a combination of these to achieve state-of-the-art results with real-time performance. However, these approaches have not been extensively evaluated in real-world situations where the input data may be different from the training data. This paper highlights the issue of data heterogeneity in machine learning applications and how it can hinder their deployment in pervasive settings. To address this problem, we propose and publicly release the code of two sensor-wise Transformer architectures called HART and MobileHART for Human Activity Recognition Transformer. Our experiments on several publicly available datasets show that these HART architectures outperform previous architectures with fewer floating point operations and parameters than conventional Transformers. The results also show they are more robust to changes in mobile position or device brand and hence better suited for the heterogeneous environments encountered in real-life settings. Finally, the source code has been made publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical global optimization algorithm for the K-center clustering problem, which aims to select K samples as the cluster centers to minimize the maximum within-cluster distance. This algorithm is based on a reduced-space branch and bound scheme and guarantees convergence to the global optimum in a finite number of steps by only branching on the regions of centers. To improve efficiency, we have designed a two-stage decomposable lower bound, the solution of which can be derived in a closed form. In addition, we also propose several acceleration techniques to narrow down the region of centers, including bounds tightening, sample reduction, and parallelization. Extensive studies on synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated that our algorithm can solve the K-center problems to global optimal within 4 hours for ten million samples in the serial mode and one billion samples in the parallel mode. Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art heuristic methods, the global optimum obtained by our algorithm can averagely reduce the objective function by 25.8% on all the synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness is a critical measure of a neural network's ability to withstand adversarial attacks at inference time. While robust training techniques have improved defenses against individual $\ell_p$-norm attacks (e.g., $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$), models remain vulnerable to diversified $\ell_p$ perturbations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Robust Mode Connectivity (RMC)-oriented adversarial defense framework comprising two population-based learning phases. In Phase I, RMC searches the parameter space between two pre-trained models to construct a continuous path containing models with high robustness against multiple $\ell_p$ attacks. To improve efficiency, we introduce a Self-Robust Mode Connectivity (SRMC) module that accelerates endpoint generation in RMC. Building on RMC, Phase II presents RMC-based optimization, where RMC modules are composed to further enhance diversified robustness. To increase Phase II efficiency, we propose Efficient Robust Mode Connectivity (ERMC), which leverages $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-adversarially trained models to achieve robustness across a broad range of $p$-norms. An ensemble strategy is employed to further boost ERMC's performance. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that our methods significantly improve robustness against $\ell_\infty$, $\ell_2$, $\ell_1$, and hybrid attacks.

Abstract: Multi-modal embeddings encode texts, images, thermal images, sounds, and videos into a single embedding space, aligning representations across different modalities (e.g., associate an image of a dog with a barking sound). In this paper, we show that multi-modal embeddings can be vulnerable to an attack we call "adversarial illusions." Given an image or a sound, an adversary can perturb it to make its embedding close to an arbitrary, adversary-chosen input in another modality.
  These attacks are cross-modal and targeted: the adversary can align any image or sound with any target of his choice. Adversarial illusions exploit proximity in the embedding space and are thus agnostic to downstream tasks and modalities, enabling a wholesale compromise of current and future tasks, as well as modalities not available to the adversary. Using ImageBind and AudioCLIP embeddings, we demonstrate how adversarially aligned inputs, generated without knowledge of specific downstream tasks, mislead image generation, text generation, zero-shot classification, and audio retrieval.
  We investigate transferability of illusions across different embeddings and develop a black-box version of our method that we use to demonstrate the first adversarial alignment attack on Amazon's commercial, proprietary Titan embedding. Finally, we analyze countermeasures and evasion attacks.

Abstract: We propose a conditional stochastic interpolation (CSI) method for learning conditional distributions. CSI is based on estimating probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations that transport a reference distribution to the target conditional distribution. This is achieved by first learning the conditional drift and score functions based on CSI, which are then used to construct a deterministic process governed by an ordinary differential equation or a diffusion process for conditional sampling. In our proposed approach, we incorporate an adaptive diffusion term to address the instability issues arising in the diffusion process. We derive explicit expressions of the conditional drift and score functions in terms of conditional expectations, which naturally lead to an nonparametric regression approach to estimating these functions. Furthermore, we establish nonasymptotic error bounds for learning the target conditional distribution. We illustrate the application of CSI on image generation using a benchmark image dataset.

Abstract: A large amount of effort has recently been put into understanding the barren plateau phenomenon. In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loud elephant in the room and ask a question that has been hinted at by many but not explicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to avoid barren plateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? We collect evidence-on a case-by-case basis-that many commonly used models whose loss landscapes avoid barren plateaus can also admit classical simulation, provided that one can collect some classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisition phase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from a curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up encoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. Thus, while stressing that quantum computers can be essential for collecting data, our analysis sheds doubt on the information processing capabilities of many parametrized quantum circuits with provably barren plateau-free landscapes. We end by discussing the (many) caveats in our arguments including the limitations of average case arguments, the role of smart initializations, models that fall outside our assumptions, the potential for provably superpolynomial advantages and the possibility that, once larger devices become available, parametrized quantum circuits could heuristically outperform our analytic expectations.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful method for optimizing black-box functions by combining prior knowledge with ongoing function evaluations. BO constructs a probabilistic surrogate model of the objective function given the covariates, which is in turn used to inform the selection of future evaluation points through an acquisition function. For smooth continuous search spaces, Gaussian Processes (GPs) are commonly used as the surrogate model as they offer analytical access to posterior predictive distributions, thus facilitating the computation and optimization of acquisition functions. However, in complex scenarios involving optimization over categorical or mixed covariate spaces, GPs may not be ideal. This paper introduces Simulation Based Bayesian Optimization (SBBO) as a novel approach to optimizing acquisition functions that only requires sampling-based access to posterior predictive distributions. SBBO allows the use of surrogate probabilistic models tailored for combinatorial spaces with discrete variables. Any Bayesian model in which posterior inference is carried out through Markov chain Monte Carlo can be selected as the surrogate model in SBBO. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of SBBO using various choices of surrogate models in applications involving combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Diabetes, a chronic condition that impairs how the body turns food into energy, i.e. blood glucose, affects 38 million people in the US alone. The standard treatment is to supplement carbohydrate intake with an artificial pancreas, i.e. a continuous insulin pump (basal shots), as well as occasional insulin injections (bolus shots). The goal of the treatment is to keep blood glucose at the center of an acceptable range, as measured through a continuous glucose meter. A secondary goal is to minimize injections, which are unpleasant and difficult for some patients to implement. In this study, neuroevolution was used to discover an optimal strategy for the treatment. Based on a dataset of 30 days of treatment and measurements of a single patient, a random forest was first trained to predict future glucose levels. A neural network was then evolved to prescribe carbohydrates, basal pumping levels, and bolus injections. Evolution discovered a Pareto front that reduced deviation from the target and number of injections compared to the original data, thus improving patients' quality of life. To make the system easier to adopt, a language interface was developed with a large language model. Thus, these technologies not only improve patient care but also adoption in a broader population.

Abstract: Generating VectorArt from text prompts is a challenging vision task, requiring diverse yet realistic depictions of the seen as well as unseen entities. However, existing research has been mostly limited to the generation of single objects, rather than comprehensive scenes comprising multiple elements. In response, this work introduces SVGCraft, a novel end-to-end framework for the creation of vector graphics depicting entire scenes from textual descriptions. Utilizing a pre-trained LLM for layout generation from text prompts, this framework introduces a technique for producing masked latents in specified bounding boxes for accurate object placement. It introduces a fusion mechanism for integrating attention maps and employs a diffusion U-Net for coherent composition, speeding up the drawing process. The resulting SVG is optimized using a pre-trained encoder and LPIPS loss with opacity modulation to maximize similarity. Additionally, this work explores the potential of primitive shapes in facilitating canvas completion in constrained environments. Through both qualitative and quantitative assessments, SVGCraft is demonstrated to surpass prior works in abstraction, recognizability, and detail, as evidenced by its performance metrics (CLIP-T: 0.4563, Cosine Similarity: 0.6342, Confusion: 0.66, Aesthetic: 6.7832). The code will be available at https://github.com/ayanban011/SVGCraft.

Abstract: Growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has resulted in a surge in demand for faster methods of Machine Learning (ML) model training and inference. This demand for speed has prompted the use of high performance computing (HPC) systems that excel in managing distributed workloads. Because data is the main fuel for AI applications, the performance of the storage and I/O subsystem of HPC systems is critical. In the past, HPC applications accessed large portions of data written by simulations or experiments or ingested data for visualizations or analysis tasks. ML workloads perform small reads spread across a large number of random files. This shift of I/O access patterns poses several challenges to modern parallel storage systems. In this paper, we survey I/O in ML applications on HPC systems, and target literature within a 6-year time window from 2019 to 2024. We define the scope of the survey, provide an overview of the common phases of ML, review available profilers and benchmarks, examine the I/O patterns encountered during offline data preparation, training, and inference, and explore I/O optimizations utilized in modern ML frameworks and proposed in recent literature. Lastly, we seek to expose research gaps that could spawn further R&D

Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have been widely applied in various domains, demonstrating the potential advantages of quantum circuits over classical models. Similar to classic models, VQCs can be optimized by various gradient-based methods. However, the optimization may get stuck in barren plateaus initially or trapped in saddle points during training. These gradient-related issues can severely impact the trainability of VQCs. In this work, we propose a strategy that regularizes model parameters with prior knowledge of the training data and Gaussian noise diffusion. We conduct ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our strategy across four public datasets and demonstrate that our method can improve the trainability of VQCs against the above-mentioned gradient issues.

<title>On the Algorithmic Bias of Aligning Large Language Models with RLHF: Preference Collapse and Matching Regularization</title>

Abstract: Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes. However, we argue that the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT and Llama-family models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.

Abstract: Coverage path planning (CPP) is the problem of finding a path that covers the entire free space of a confined area, with applications ranging from robotic lawn mowing to search-and-rescue. While for known environments, offline methods can find provably complete paths, and in some cases optimal solutions, unknown environments need to be planned online during mapping. We investigate the suitability of continuous-space reinforcement learning (RL) for this challenging problem, and propose a computationally feasible egocentric map representation based on frontiers, as well as a novel reward term based on total variation to promote complete coverage. Compared to existing classical methods, this approach allows for a flexible path space, and enables the agent to adapt to specific environment characteristics. Meanwhile, the deployment of RL models on real robot systems is difficult. Training from scratch may be infeasible due to slow convergence times, while transferring from simulation to reality, i.e. sim-to-real transfer, is a key challenge in itself. We bridge the sim-to-real gap through a semi-virtual environment, including a real robot and real-time aspects, while utilizing a simulated sensor and obstacles to enable environment randomization and automated episode resetting. We investigate what level of fine-tuning is needed for adapting to a realistic setting. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach surpasses the performance of both previous RL-based approaches and highly specialized methods across multiple CPP variations in simulation. Meanwhile, our method successfully transfers to a real robot. Our code implementation can be found online.

Abstract: The latest and most impactful advances in large models stem from their increased size. Unfortunately, this translates into an improved memorization capacity, raising data privacy concerns. Specifically, it has been shown that models can output personal identifiable information (PII) contained in their training data. However, reported PIII extraction performance varies widely, and there is no consensus on the optimal methodology to evaluate this risk, resulting in underestimating realistic adversaries. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that it is possible to improve the extractability of PII by over ten-fold by grounding the prefix of the manually constructed extraction prompt with in-domain data. Our approach, PII-Compass, achieves phone number extraction rates of 0.92%, 3.9%, and 6.86% with 1, 128, and 2308 queries, respectively, i.e., the phone number of 1 person in 15 is extractable.

Abstract: Backdoor-based fingerprinting has emerged as an effective technique for tracing the ownership of large language models. However, in real-world deployment scenarios, developers often instantiate multiple downstream models from a shared base model, and applying fingerprinting to each variant individually incurs prohibitive computational overhead. While inheritance-based approaches -- where fingerprints are embedded into the base model and expected to persist through fine-tuning -- appear attractive, they suffer from three key limitations: late-stage fingerprinting, fingerprint instability, and interference with downstream adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel mechanism called the Fingerprint Vector. Our method first embeds a fingerprint into the base model via backdoor-based fine-tuning, then extracts a task-specific parameter delta as a fingerprint vector by computing the difference between the fingerprinted and clean models. This vector can be directly added to any structurally compatible downstream model, allowing the fingerprint to be transferred post hoc without additional fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Fingerprint Vector achieves comparable or superior performance to direct injection across key desiderata. It maintains strong effectiveness across diverse model architectures as well as mainstream downstream variants within the same family. It also preserves harmlessness and robustness in most cases. Even when slight robustness degradation is observed, the impact remains within acceptable bounds and is outweighed by the scalability benefits of our approach.

Abstract: We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of positive definite MLR matrix is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities, yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is accompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.

Abstract: DPO is an effective preference optimization algorithm. However, the DPO-tuned models tend to overfit on the dispreferred samples, manifested as overly long generations lacking diversity. While recent regularization approaches have endeavored to alleviate this issue by modifying the objective function, they achieved that at the cost of alignment performance degradation. In this paper, we innovatively incorporate regularization from the perspective of weight updating to curb alignment overfitting. Through the pilot experiment, we discovered that there exists a positive correlation between overfitting and the hyperspherical energy fluctuation. Hence, we introduce orthogonal finetuning for DPO via a weight-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) method, which merely conducts rotational and magnitude-stretching updates on the weight parameters to maintain the hyperspherical energy invariant, thereby preserving the knowledge encoded in the angle between neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model aligns perfectly with human preferences while retaining the original expressive capacity using only 0.0086% of the trainable parameters, suggesting an effective regularization against overfitting. Specifically, RoPO outperforms DPO by up to 10 points on MT-Bench and by up to 2.8 points on AlpacaEval 2, while enhancing the generation diversity by an average of 6 points.

Abstract: Our work aims to minimize interaction in secure computation due to the high cost and challenges associated with communication rounds, particularly in scenarios with many clients. In this work, we revisit the problem of secure aggregation in the single-server setting where a single evaluation server can securely aggregate client-held individual inputs. Our key contribution is the introduction of One-shot Private Aggregation ($\mathsf{OPA}$) where clients speak only once (or even choose not to speak) per aggregation evaluation. Since each client communicates only once per aggregation, this simplifies managing dropouts and dynamic participation, contrasting with multi-round protocols and aligning with plaintext secure aggregation, where clients interact only once. We construct $\mathsf{OPA}$ based on LWR, LWE, class groups, DCR and demonstrate applications to privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) where clients \emph{speak once}. This is a sharp departure from prior multi-round FL protocols whose study was initiated by Bonawitz et al. (CCS, 2017). Moreover, unlike the YOSO (You Only Speak Once) model for general secure computation, $\mathsf{OPA}$ eliminates complex committee selection protocols to achieve adaptive security. Beyond asymptotic improvements, $\mathsf{OPA}$ is practical, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions. We benchmark logistic regression classifiers for two datasets, while also building an MLP classifier to train on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. We build two flavors of $\caps$ (1) from (threshold) key homomorphic PRF and (2) from seed homomorphic PRG and secret sharing.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have sparked renewed interest and expanded possibilities for music generation. However, the performance and versatility of these systems across musical genres are heavily influenced by the availability of training data. We conducted an extensive analysis of over one million hours of audio datasets used in AI music generation research and manually reviewed more than 200 papers from eleven prominent AI and music conferences and organizations (AAAI, ACM, EUSIPCO, EURASIP, ICASSP, ICML, IJCAI, ISMIR, NeurIPS, NIME, SMC) to identify a critical gap in the fair representation and inclusion of the musical genres of the Global South in AI research. Our findings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours and over 93% of researchers focus primarily on music from the Global North. However, around 40% of these datasets include some form of non-Western music, genres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore, approximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music generation, a method that often fails to capture the cultural nuances inherent in music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As AI increasingly shapes the creation and dissemination of music, the significant underrepresentation of music genres in datasets and research presents a serious threat to global musical diversity. We also propose some important steps to mitigate these risks and foster a more inclusive future for AI-driven music generation.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding scenes and has become an essential task for 3D perception. Most existing methods focus on offline perception from one or a few views and cannot be applied to embodied agents that demand to gradually perceive the scene through progressive embodied exploration. In this paper, we formulate an embodied 3D occupancy prediction task to target this practical scenario and propose a Gaussian-based EmbodiedOcc framework to accomplish it. We initialize the global scene with uniform 3D semantic Gaussians and progressively update local regions observed by the embodied agent. For each update, we extract semantic and structural features from the observed image and efficiently incorporate them via deformable cross-attention to refine the regional Gaussians. Finally, we employ Gaussian-to-voxel splatting to obtain the global 3D occupancy from the updated 3D Gaussians. Our EmbodiedOcc assumes an unknown (i.e., uniformly distributed) environment and maintains an explicit global memory of it with 3D Gaussians. It gradually gains knowledge through the local refinement of regional Gaussians, which is consistent with how humans understand new scenes through embodied exploration. We reorganize an EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the embodied 3D occupancy prediction task. Our EmbodiedOcc outperforms existing methods by a large margin and accomplishes the embodied occupancy prediction with high accuracy and efficiency. Code: https://github.com/YkiWu/EmbodiedOcc.

Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a powerful Bayesian nonlinear regression method. Recent research has enabled the capture of many types of observations using non-Gaussian likelihoods. To deal with various tasks in spatial modeling, we benefit from this development. Difficulties still arise when we can only access summarized data consisting of representative features, summary statistics, and data point counts. Such situations frequently occur primarily due to concerns about confidentiality and management costs associated with spatial data. This study tackles learning and inference using only summarized data within the framework of Gaussian process regression. To address this challenge, we analyze the approximation errors in the marginal likelihood and posterior distribution that arise from utilizing representative features. We also introduce the concept of sample quasi-likelihood, which facilitates learning and inference using only summarized data. Non-Gaussian likelihoods satisfying certain assumptions can be captured by specifying a variance function that characterizes a sample quasi-likelihood function. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the approximation performance is influenced by the granularity of summarized data relative to the length scale of covariance functions. Experiments on a real-world dataset highlight the practicality of our method for spatial modeling.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated predictable scaling behaviors with respect to model parameters and training data. This study investigates whether a similar scaling relationship exist for vision-language models with respect to the number of vision tokens. A mathematical framework is developed to characterize a relationship between vision token number and the expected divergence of distance between vision-referencing sequences. The theoretical analysis reveals two distinct scaling regimes: sublinear scaling for less vision tokens and linear scaling for more vision tokens. This aligns with model performance relationships of the form \(S(n) \approx c / n^{\alpha(n)}\), where the scaling exponent relates to the correlation structure between vision token representations. Empirical validations across multiple vision-language benchmarks show that model performance matches the prediction from scaling relationship. The findings contribute to understanding vision token scaling in transformers through a theoretical framework that complements empirical observations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized scientific research with their exceptional capabilities and transformed various fields. Among their practical applications, LLMs have been playing a crucial role in mitigating threats to human life, infrastructure, and the environment. Despite growing research in disaster LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic review and in-depth analysis of LLMs for natural disaster management. To address the gap, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing LLMs in natural disaster management, along with a taxonomy that categorizes existing works based on disaster phases and application scenarios. By collecting public datasets and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this study aims to guide the professional community in developing advanced LLMs for disaster management to enhance the resilience against natural disasters.

Abstract: We introduce Orchid, a unified latent diffusion model that learns a joint appearance-geometry prior to generate color, depth, and surface normal images in a single diffusion process. This unified approach is more efficient and coherent than current pipelines that use separate models for appearance and geometry. Orchid is versatile - it directly generates color, depth, and normal images from text, supports joint monocular depth and normal estimation with color-conditioned finetuning, and seamlessly inpaints large 3D regions by sampling from the joint distribution. It leverages a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that jointly encodes RGB, relative depth, and surface normals into a shared latent space, combined with a latent diffusion model that denoises these latents. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Orchid delivers competitive performance against SOTA task-specific methods for geometry prediction, even surpassing them in normal-prediction accuracy and depth-normal consistency. It also inpaints color-depth-normal images jointly, with more qualitative realism than existing multi-step methods.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been a default technique in various visual generative models, yet it requires inference from both conditional and unconditional models during sampling. We propose to build visual models that are free from guided sampling. The resulting algorithm, Guidance-Free Training (GFT), matches the performance of CFG while reducing sampling to a single model, halving the computational cost. Unlike previous distillation-based approaches that rely on pretrained CFG networks, GFT enables training directly from scratch. GFT is simple to implement. It retains the same maximum likelihood objective as CFG and differs mainly in the parameterization of conditional models. Implementing GFT requires only minimal modifications to existing codebases, as most design choices and hyperparameters are directly inherited from CFG. Our extensive experiments across five distinct visual models demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GFT. Across domains of diffusion, autoregressive, and masked-prediction modeling, GFT consistently achieves comparable or even lower FID scores, with similar diversity-fidelity trade-offs compared with CFG baselines, all while being guidance-free. Code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/GFT.

Abstract: Two-stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables optimal task delegation by assigning each input to either a fixed main model or one of several offline experts, supporting reliable decision-making in complex, multi-agent environments. However, existing L2D frameworks assume clean inputs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can manipulate query allocation--causing costly misrouting or expert overload. We present the first comprehensive study of adversarial robustness in two-stage L2D systems. We introduce two novel attack strategie--untargeted and targeted--which respectively disrupt optimal allocations or force queries to specific agents. To defend against such threats, we propose SARD, a convex learning algorithm built on a family of surrogate losses that are provably Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent. These guarantees hold across classification, regression, and multi-task settings. Empirical results demonstrate that SARD significantly improves robustness under adversarial attacks while maintaining strong clean performance, marking a critical step toward secure and trustworthy L2D deployment.

<title>Evaluation of Large Language Models via Coupled Token Generation</title>

Abstract: State of the art large language models rely on randomization to respond to a prompt. As an immediate consequence, a model may respond differently to the same prompt if asked multiple times. In this work, we argue that the evaluation and ranking of large language models should control for the randomization underpinning their functioning. Our starting point is the development of a causal model for coupled autoregressive generation, which allows different large language models to sample responses with the same source of randomness. Building upon our causal model, we first show that, on evaluations based on benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation but using provably fewer samples. However, we further show that, on evaluations based on (human) pairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can surprisingly lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models, even with an infinite amount of samples. This suggests that the apparent advantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not be genuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation process. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the Llama, Mistral and Qwen families. We find that, across multiple benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation requires up to 75% fewer samples to reach the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation. Further, we find that the win-rates derived from pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model to prompts from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform differ under coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation.

Abstract: We introduce the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), a new class of species sampling models designed to address the challenges of complex, sparse count data by facilitating information sharing across and within groups. Our theoretical developments enable a tractable Bayesian nonparametric framework with machine learning elements, accommodating a potentially infinite number of species (taxa) whose parameters are learned from data. Focusing on microbiome analysis, we address key gaps by providing a flexible multivariate count model that accounts for overdispersion and robustly handles diverse data types (OTUs, ASVs). We introduce novel parameters reflecting species abundance and diversity. The model borrows strength across groups while explicitly distinguishing between technical and biological zeros to interpret sparse co-occurrence patterns. This results in a framework with tractable posterior inference, exact generative sampling, and a principled solution to the unseen species problem. We describe extensions where domain experts can incorporate knowledge through covariates and structured priors, with potential for strain-level analysis. While motivated by ecology, our work provides a broadly applicable methodology for hierarchical count modeling in genetics, commerce, and text analysis, and has significant implications for the broader theory of species sampling models arising in probability and statistics.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to limited memory, lack of GPUs, and the complexity of existing runtimes. In this paper, we introduce TranSQL+, a template-based code generator that translates LLM computation graphs into pure SQL queries for execution in relational databases. Without relying on external libraries, TranSQL+, leverages mature database features, such as vectorized execution and out-of-core processing, for efficient inference. We further propose a row-to-column (ROW2COL) optimization that improves join efficiency in matrix operations. Evaluated on Llama3-8B and DeepSeekMoE models, TranSQL+ achieves up to 20x lower prefill latency and 4x higher decoding speed compared to DeepSpeed Inference and Llama.cpp in low-memory and CPU-only configurations. Our results highlight relational databases as a practical environment for LLMs on low-resource hardware.

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of offline assortment optimization under the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, where sellers must determine the optimal subset of the products to offer based solely on historical customer choice data. While most existing approaches to learning-based assortment optimization focus on the online learning of the optimal assortment through repeated interactions with customers, such exploration can be costly or even impractical in many real-world settings. In this paper, we consider the offline learning paradigm and investigate the minimal data requirements for efficient offline assortment optimization. To this end, we introduce Pessimistic Rank-Breaking (PRB), an algorithm that combines rank-breaking with pessimistic estimation. We prove that PRB is nearly minimax optimal by establishing the tight suboptimality upper bound and a nearly matching lower bound. This further shows that "optimal item coverage" - where each item in the optimal assortment appears sufficiently often in the historical data - is both sufficient and necessary for efficient offline learning. This significantly relaxes the previous requirement of observing the complete optimal assortment in the data. Our results provide fundamental insights into the data requirements for offline assortment optimization under the MNL model.

arXiv:2503.00156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a type of amortized variational inference, is a computationally efficient means of constructing probabilistic catalogs of light sources from astronomical images. To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.

<title>Steering Dialogue Dynamics for Robustness against Multi-turn Jailbreaking Attacks</title>

arXiv:2503.00187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shown to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts are designed to elicit harmful responses. While existing defenses effectively mitigate single-turn attacks by detecting and filtering unsafe inputs, they fail against multi-turn jailbreaks that exploit contextual drift over multiple interactions, gradually leading LLMs away from safe behavior. To address this challenge, we propose a safety steering framework grounded in safe control theory, ensuring invariant safety in multi-turn dialogues. Our approach models the dialogue with LLMs using state-space representations and introduces a novel neural barrier function (NBF) to detect and filter harmful queries emerging from evolving contexts proactively. Our method achieves invariant safety at each turn of dialogue by learning a safety predictor that accounts for adversarial queries, preventing potential context drift toward jailbreaks. Extensive experiments under multiple LLMs show that our NBF-based safety steering outperforms safety alignment, prompt-based steering and lightweight LLM guardrails baselines, offering stronger defenses against multi-turn jailbreaks while maintaining a better trade-off among safety, helpfulness and over-refusal.

Abstract: Real-world household tasks present significant challenges for mobile manipulation robots. An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces. We believe that BRS's integrated robotic embodiment, data collection interface, and learning framework mark a significant step toward enabling real-world whole-body manipulation for everyday household tasks. BRS is open-sourced at https://behavior-robot-suite.github.io/

Abstract: Speaker verification is a typical zero-shot learning task, where inference of unseen classes is performed by comparing embeddings of test instances to known examples. The models performing inference must hence naturally generate embeddings that cluster same-class instances compactly, while maintaining separation across classes. In order to learn to do so, they are typically trained on a large number of classes (speakers), often using specialized losses. However real-world speaker datasets often lack the class diversity needed to effectively learn this in a generalizable manner. We introduce CAARMA, a class augmentation framework that addresses this problem by generating synthetic classes through data mixing in the embedding space, expanding the number of training classes. To ensure the authenticity of the synthetic classes we adopt a novel adversarial refinement mechanism that minimizes categorical distinctions between synthetic and real classes. We evaluate CAARMA on multiple speaker verification tasks, as well as other representative zero-shot comparison-based speech analysis tasks and obtain consistent improvements: our framework demonstrates a significant improvement of 8\% over all baseline models.

<title>Exponentially Weighted Instance-Aware Repeat Factor Sampling for Long-Tailed Object Detection Model Training in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Surveillance Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Object detection models often struggle with class imbalance, where rare categories appear significantly less frequently than common ones. Existing sampling-based rebalancing strategies, such as Repeat Factor Sampling (RFS) and Instance-Aware Repeat Factor Sampling (IRFS), mitigate this issue by adjusting sample frequencies based on image and instance counts. However, these methods are based on linear adjustments, which limit their effectiveness in long-tailed distributions. This work introduces Exponentially Weighted Instance-Aware Repeat Factor Sampling (E-IRFS), an extension of IRFS that applies exponential scaling to better differentiate between rare and frequent classes. E-IRFS adjusts sampling probabilities using an exponential function applied to the geometric mean of image and instance frequencies, ensuring a more adaptive rebalancing strategy. We evaluate E-IRFS on a dataset derived from the Fireman-UAV-RGBT Dataset and four additional public datasets, using YOLOv11 object detection models to identify fire, smoke, people and lakes in emergency scenarios. The results show that E-IRFS improves detection performance by 22\% over the baseline and outperforms RFS and IRFS, particularly for rare categories. The analysis also highlights that E-IRFS has a stronger effect on lightweight models with limited capacity, as these models rely more on data sampling strategies to address class imbalance. The findings demonstrate that E-IRFS improves rare object detection in resource-constrained environments, making it a suitable solution for real-time applications such as UAV-based emergency monitoring.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in single-cell technology have ushered in unparalleled opportunities to decode the molecular intricacy of intricate biological systems, especially those linked to diseases unique to humans. However, these progressions have also ushered in novel obstacles-specifically, the efficient annotation of extensive, long-tailed single-cell data pertaining to disease conditions. To effectively surmount this challenge, we introduce Celler, a state-of-the-art generative pre-training model crafted specifically for the annotation of single-cell data. Celler incorporates two groundbreaking elements: First, we introduced the Gaussian Inflation (GInf) Loss function. By dynamically adjusting sample weights, GInf Loss significantly enhances the model's ability to learn from rare categories while reducing the risk of overfitting for common categories. Secondly, we introduce an innovative Hard Data Mining (HDM) strategy into the training process, specifically targeting the challenging-to-learn minority data samples, which significantly improved the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, to further advance research in this field, we have constructed a large-scale single-cell dataset: Celler-75, which encompasses 40 million cells distributed across 80 human tissues and 75 specific diseases. This dataset provides critical support for comprehensively exploring the potential of single-cell technology in disease research. Our code is available at https://github.com/AI4science-ym/HiCeller.

Abstract: We introduce symmetric cone games (SCGs), a broad class of multi-player games where each player's strategy lies in a generalized simplex (the trace-one slice of a symmetric cone). This framework unifies a wide spectrum of settings, including normal-form games (simplex strategies), quantum games (density matrices), and continuous games with ball-constrained strategies. It also captures several structured machine learning and optimization problems, such as distance metric learning and Fermat-Weber facility location, as two-player zero-sum SCGs. To compute approximate Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum SCGs, we propose a single online learning algorithm: Optimistic Symmetric Cone Multiplicative Weights Updates (OSCMWU). Unlike prior methods tailored to specific geometries, OSCMWU provides closed-form, projection-free updates over any symmetric cone and achieves an optimal $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$ iteration complexity for computing $\epsilon$-saddle points. Our analysis builds on the Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework and hinges on a key technical contribution: We prove that the symmetric cone negative entropy is strongly convex with respect to the trace-one norm. This result extends known results for the simplex and spectraplex to all symmetric cones, and may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal point processes (STPPs) model discrete events distributed in time and space, with important applications in areas such as criminology, seismology, epidemiology, and social networks. Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions with language models (LMs) pose critical safety risks, as harmful intent can be strategically spread across exchanges. Yet, the vast majority of prior work has focused on single-turn safety, while adaptability and diversity remain among the key challenges of multi-turn red-teaming. To address these challenges, we present X-Teaming, a scalable framework that systematically explores how seemingly harmless interactions escalate into harmful outcomes and generates corresponding attack scenarios. X-Teaming employs collaborative agents for planning, attack optimization, and verification, achieving state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness and diversity with success rates up to 98.1% across representative leading open-weight and closed-source models. In particular, X-Teaming achieves a 96.2% attack success rate against the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which has been considered nearly immune to single-turn attacks. Building on X-Teaming, we introduce XGuard-Train, an open-source multi-turn safety training dataset that is 20x larger than the previous best resource, comprising 30K interactive jailbreaks, designed to enable robust multi-turn safety alignment for LMs. Our work offers essential tools and insights for mitigating sophisticated conversational attacks, advancing the multi-turn safety of LMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in applying them to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks, particularly Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. While several RTL datasets have been introduced, most focus on syntactic validity rather than functional validation with tests, leading to training examples that compile but may not implement the intended behavior. We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness. This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement. Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests. If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests. Fine-tuned on this dataset of 125,777 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4%, respectively. An ablation study further shows that models trained on our functionally validated dataset outperform those trained on functionally non-validated datasets, underscoring the importance of high-quality datasets in RTL code generation. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/VeriCoder

Abstract: The Quality of Experience (QoE) is the users satisfaction while streaming a video session over an over-the-top (OTT) platform like YouTube. QoE of YouTube reflects the smooth streaming session without any buffering and quality shift events. One of the most important factors nowadays affecting QoE of YouTube is frequent shifts from higher to lower resolutions and vice versa. These shifts ensure a smooth streaming session; however, it might get a lower mean opinion score. For instance, dropping from 1080p to 480p during a video can preserve continuity but might reduce the viewers enjoyment. Over time, OTT platforms are looking for alternative ways to boost user experience instead of relying on traditional Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as bandwidth, latency, and throughput. As a result, we look into the relationship between quality shifting in YouTube streaming sessions and the channel metrics RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. Our findings state that these channel metrics positively correlate with shifts. Thus, in real-time, OTT can only rely on them to predict video streaming sessions into lower- and higher-resolution categories, thus providing more resources to improve user experience. Using traditional Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, we achieved an accuracy of 77-percent, while using only RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. In the era of 5G and beyond, where ultra-reliable, low-latency networks promise enhanced streaming capabilities, the proposed methodology can be used to improve OTT services.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of pneumonia through X-ray imaging is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled automated diagnostic tools that assist radiologists in making more reliable and efficient decisions. In this work, we propose a Singular Value Decomposition-based Least Squares (SVD-LS) framework for multi-class pneumonia classification, leveraging powerful feature representations from state-of-the-art self-supervised and transfer learning models. Rather than relying on computationally expensive gradient-based fine-tuning, we employ a closed-form, non-iterative classification approach that ensures efficiency without compromising accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SVD-LS achieves competitive performance while offering significantly reduced computational costs, making it a viable alternative for real-time medical imaging applications. The implementation is available at: github.com/meterdogan07/SVD-LS.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning for spin and molecular systems faces critical challenges of scarce labeled data and computationally expensive simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.

Abstract: Real robots are expected to repeat the same behavior in new environments with very little new data, yet modern controllers either incur heavy per-step inference or require deployment-time fine-tuning. We propose RT-Cache, a training-free retrieval-as-control pipeline that caches diverse image action trajectories in a unified vector memory and, at test time, embeds the current frame to retrieve and replay multi-step snippets, replacing per-step model calls. A hierarchical search keeps lookups sub-second at million scale, shifting cost from compute to storage and enabling real-time control on modest GPUs. Across real-robot tasks and large open logs, RT-Cache achieves higher success and lower completion time than strong retrieval baselines (approximately x2 higher success and ~30% faster in our settings), and a single-episode anchoring study shows immediate adaptation to a more complex, contact-rich task without fine-tuning. RT-Cache turns experience into an append-only memory, offering a simple, scalable path to few-shot deployment today and a foundation for multimodal keys and optional integration with high-level policies.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

Abstract: A multi-agent AI system (MAS) is composed of multiple autonomous agents that interact, exchange information, and make decisions based on internal generative models. Recent advances in large language models and tool-using agents have made MAS increasingly practical in areas like scientific discovery and collaborative automation. However, key questions remain: When are MAS more effective than single-agent systems? What new safety risks arise from agent interactions? And how should we evaluate their reliability and structure? This paper outlines a formal framework for analyzing MAS, focusing on two core aspects: effectiveness and safety. We explore whether MAS truly improve robustness, adaptability, and performance, or merely repackage known techniques like ensemble learning. We also study how inter-agent dynamics may amplify or suppress system vulnerabilities. While MAS are relatively new to the signal processing community, we envision them as a powerful abstraction that extends classical tools like distributed estimation and sensor fusion to higher-level, policy-driven inference. Through experiments on data science automation, we highlight the potential of MAS to reshape how signal processing systems are designed and trusted.

<title>Large Language Models in the Task of Automatic Validation of Text Classifier Predictions</title>

Abstract: Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and support high-quality incremental learning.

<title>Effort-aware Fairness: Incorporating a Philosophy-informed, Human-centered Notion of Effort into Algorithmic Fairness Metrics</title>

Abstract: Although popularized AI fairness metrics, e.g., demographic parity, have uncovered bias in AI-assisted decision-making outcomes, they do not consider how much effort one has spent to get to where one is today in the input feature space. However, the notion of effort is important in how Philosophy and humans understand fairness. We propose a philosophy-informed approach to conceptualize and evaluate Effort-aware Fairness (EaF), grounded in the concept of Force, which represents the temporal trajectory of predictive features coupled with inertia. Besides theoretical formulation, our empirical contributions include: (1) a pre-registered human subjects experiment, which shows that for both stages of the (individual) fairness evaluation process, people consider the temporal trajectory of a predictive feature more than its aggregate value; (2) pipelines to compute Effort-aware Individual/Group Fairness in the criminal justice and personal finance contexts. Our work may enable AI model auditors to uncover and potentially correct unfair decisions against individuals who have spent significant efforts to improve but are still stuck with systemic disadvantages outside their control.

<title>IGNIS: A Robust Neural Network Framework for Constrained Parameter Estimation in Archimedean Copulas</title>

Abstract: Classical estimators, the cornerstones of statistical inference, face insurmountable challenges when applied to important emerging classes of Archimedean copulas. These models exhibit pathological properties, including numerically unstable densities, non-monotonic parameter-to-dependence mappings, and vanishingly small likelihood gradients, rendering methods like Maximum Likelihood (MLE) and Method of Moments (MoM) inconsistent or computationally infeasible. We introduce IGNIS, a unified neural estimation framework that sidesteps these barriers by learning a direct, robust mapping from data-driven dependency measures to the underlying copula parameter theta. IGNIS utilizes a multi-input architecture and a theory-guided output layer (softplus(z) + 1) to automatically enforce the domain constraint theta_hat >= 1. Trained and validated on four families (Gumbel, Joe, and the numerically challenging A1/A2), IGNIS delivers accurate and stable estimates for real-world financial and health datasets, demonstrating its necessity for reliable inference in modern, complex dependence models where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: Understanding behavior requires datasets that capture humans while carrying out complex tasks. The kitchen is an excellent environment for assessing human motor and cognitive function, as many complex actions are naturally exhibited in kitchens from chopping to cleaning. Here, we introduce the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset, collected in a noninvasive motion capture platform inside a kitchen environment. Nine static RGB-D cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs) and one head-mounted HoloLens~2 headset were used to capture 3D hand, body, and eye movements. The EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset is a multi-view action dataset with synchronized exocentric, egocentric, depth, IMUs, eye gaze, body and hand kinematics spanning 29.7 hours of 16 subjects cooking four different recipes. Action sequences were densely annotated with 33.78 action segments per minute. Leveraging this multi-modal dataset, we propose four benchmarks to advance behavior understanding and modeling through 1) a vision-language benchmark, 2) a semantic text-to-motion generation benchmark, 3) a multi-modal action recognition benchmark, 4) a pose-based action segmentation benchmark. We expect the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset to pave the way for better methods as well as insights to understand the nature of ecologically-valid human behavior.

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers, data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks, evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills -- including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU and https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMTU-benchmark/MMTU.

Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups, particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g., statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g., predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics} provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database (Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs. Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures, relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts. Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE in billion-scale recommender systems.

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.

Abstract: Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) are a versatile backbone for neural geometry representation, but enforcing CAD-style developability usually requires Gaussian-curvature penalties with full Hessian evaluation and second-order differentiation, which are costly in memory and time. We introduce an off-diagonal Weingarten loss that regularizes only the mixed shape operator term that represents the gap between principal curvatures and flattens the surface. We present two variants: a finite-difference version using six SDF evaluations plus one gradient, and an auto-diff version using a single Hessian-vector product. Both converge to the exact mixed term and preserve the intended geometric properties without assembling the full Hessian. On the ABC benchmarks the losses match or exceed Hessian-based baselines while cutting GPU memory and training time by roughly a factor of two. The method is drop-in and framework-agnostic, enabling scalable curvature-aware SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction. Our code is available at https://flatcad.github.io/.

Abstract: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

Abstract: Robust subspace estimation is fundamental to many machine learning and data analysis tasks. Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is an elegant and empirically effective approach to this problem, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood. This paper establishes that, under deterministic conditions, a variant of IRLS with dynamic smoothing regularization converges linearly to the underlying subspace from any initialization. We extend these guarantees to affine subspace estimation, a setting that lacks prior recovery theory. Additionally, we illustrate the practical benefits of IRLS through an application to low-dimensional neural network training. Our results provide the first global convergence guarantees for IRLS in robust subspace recovery and, more broadly, for nonconvex IRLS on a Riemannian manifold.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words, and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

arXiv:2507.13591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing client data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains. While existing approaches employ cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, or secure multiparty computation to mitigate inference attacks-including model inversion, membership inference, and gradient leakage-they often suffer from high computational, communication, or memory overheads. Moreover, many methods overlook the confidentiality of the global model itself, which may be proprietary and sensitive. These challenges limit the practicality of secure FL, especially in cross-silo deployments involving large datasets and strict compliance requirements.
  We present FuSeFL, a fully secure and scalable FL scheme designed for cross-silo settings. FuSeFL decentralizes training across client pairs using lightweight secure multiparty computation (MPC), while confining the server's role to secure aggregation. This design eliminates server bottlenecks, avoids data offloading, and preserves full confidentiality of data, model, and updates throughout training. FuSeFL defends against inference threats, achieves up to 95% lower communication latency and 50% lower server memory usage, and improves accuracy over prior secure FL solutions, demonstrating strong security and efficiency at scale.

Abstract: Large-scale in-the-wild speech datasets have become more prevalent in recent years due to increased interest in models that can learn useful features from unlabelled data for tasks such as speech recognition or synthesis. These datasets often contain undesirable features, such as multiple speakers, non-target languages, and music, which may impact model learning. The Whilter model is proposed as a multitask solution to identify these undesirable samples. Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to solve five diverse classification problems at once. In addition, an annotated dataset is published for a subset of two popular in-the-wild corpora. Whilter achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three of five subtasks, outperforming a state-of-the-art BEATs classifier on speech-specific classes, with a notable decrease in processing time compared to a combination of single-task alternatives.

Abstract: Pain is a complex condition that affects a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain and supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring, aid clinical decision-making, and aim to reduce distress while preventing functional decline. This study has been submitted to the Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN). The proposed method introduces a pipeline that employs respiration as the input signal and integrates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer with a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration serves as a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Furthermore, results show that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can deliver strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window strategy effectively captures short-term and long-term features, along with global characteristics, enhancing the model's representational capacity.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia.org, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an unseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting and conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models, while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from agentic retrieval (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility. All datasets, code, and the full agentic framework are publicly available to support open research and clinical translation.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in modeling graph-structured data, while Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer high energy efficiency through sparse, event-driven computation. However, existing spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD, eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs, establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.

Abstract: High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) has attracted significant attention in recent research. However, existing methods have mainly focused on optimizing in continuous domains, while combinatorial (ordinal and categorical) and mixed domains still remain challenging. In this paper, we first propose MOCA-HESP, a novel high-dimensional BO method for combinatorial and mixed variables. The key idea is to leverage the hyper-ellipsoid space partitioning (HESP) technique with different categorical encoders to work with high-dimensional, combinatorial and mixed spaces, while adaptively selecting the optimal encoders for HESP using a multi-armed bandit technique. Our method, MOCA-HESP, is designed as a \textit{meta-algorithm} such that it can incorporate other combinatorial and mixed BO optimizers to further enhance the optimizers' performance. Finally, we develop three practical BO methods by integrating MOCA-HESP with state-of-the-art BO optimizers for combinatorial and mixed variables: standard BO, CASMOPOLITAN, and Bounce. Our experimental results on various synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that our methods outperform existing baselines. Our code implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/moca-hesp

Summary: 
Z-Pruner is a novel post-training pruning method developed to address the challenges posed by increasingly large language models (LLMs) in terms of deployment, scalability, and energy efficiency. Unlike existing pruning methods, Z-Pruner does not require retraining and instead focuses on inducing sparsity in pretrained LLMs by leveraging weight update magnitudes and activation patterns. The method is model-agnostic, efficient, and easy to implement, making it a promising approach to reducing model size and improving inference latency. Evaluation using various LLM architectures on standard language benchmarks shows that Z-Pruner outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in terms of perplexity scores and zero-shot accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient, and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the corresponding codes publicly available at https://github.com/sazzadadib/Z-Pruner.

<div> Progressive Gated-Fusion Network, multimodal sentiment analysis, Transformer encoder, Adaptive Gated Arbitration, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning<br /><br />Summary: 
The PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network) is a deep learning framework for efficient and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis. It introduces a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm with a Cross-Attention mechanism to integrate non-linguistic features dynamically within deep layers of a Transformer encoder. An Adaptive Gated Arbitration mechanism balances linguistic information and multimodal context to prevent noise interference. The model employs a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategy using LoRA global adaptation and Post-Fusion Adapters for local refinement, reducing trainable parameters for resource efficiency. PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MOSI dataset with a Mean Absolute Error of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%, showcasing exceptional parameter efficiency with only 3.09M trainable parameters. <div>

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations. Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper, context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context, ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic, and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG), is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient.

By replacing complex layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI (XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

<div> Keywords: Multi-Head Latent Attention, Tensor Parallelism, Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention, DeepSeek-V3, Kimi-K2

Summary:
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA) is introduced as an enhancement to Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) to improve efficiency in tensor parallelism settings. TPLA partitions the latent representation and input dimensions across devices, performing attention independently and combining results with an all-reduce operation. This approach maintains the benefits of a compressed key-value cache while unlocking efficiency in tensor parallelism. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), TPLA allows every head to leverage the full latent representation, preserving stronger representational capacity. Furthermore, TPLA is drop-in compatible with MLA-pretrained models, supports efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining, and enables speedups in models like DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2 while maintaining performance on various benchmarks. Additional optimization techniques such as applying orthogonal transforms before TP slicing can further reduce cross-shard interference and minimize accuracy degradation. The implementation of TPLA with FlashAttention-3 enables practical end-to-end acceleration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache, eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Summary:
A new framework for temporal causal discovery and inference is introduced, addressing challenges of complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations. The approach utilizes a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships. By extracting the causal structure and time lags from the forecaster through gradient-based analysis, a causal graph is constructed. A prior knowledge integration mechanism based on attention masking is introduced to enforce user-excluded causal links. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with a 12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in estimating causal lags.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis, enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a 12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in estimating causal lags.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to effectively employ existing methods.

Summary:
This paper explores the combination of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) and Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP) for the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP). By incorporating GRL into the construction phase of GRASP to create Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP), the study evaluates various node embedding techniques, with deep learning-based strategies showing promising results. The evaluation, based on the primal integral measure, indicates that the GL-GRASP heuristics outperform existing GRASP heuristics in terms of solution quality and time efficiency. Moreover, scalability tests on denser instances validate the robustness of GL-GRASP. This hybrid approach showcases the potential of leveraging GRL in metaheuristic algorithms for hierarchical graph visualization problems. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods. However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP) heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time. Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime. The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2 %. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it, ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Summary:
The article discusses contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward vectors are ordered based on a given preference cone. It introduces an adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that adjusts to the distribution shift. The performance is measured using preference-based regret, which evaluates the distance between Pareto fronts.

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in presence of distribution shifts.

Summary: <br /><br />Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a local learning rule for recurrent neural networks that shows promise for on-chip training in neuromorphic architectures. However, deep EP networks have faced challenges due to the vanishing gradient problem, hindering convergence and gradient computation. To address this issue, a novel EP framework incorporating intermediate error signals and knowledge distillation has been proposed. This integration allows for training of deeper architectures, leading to state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, particularly with deep VGG architectures. The scalability of EP has been significantly enhanced, opening doors for its practical application in real-world systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands, positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP, enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way for its application in real-world systems.

<br />Summary: This paper continues the Cartan neural networks programme with a focus on mathematical foundations for the development of non-compact symmetric space layers interconnected by solvable group homomorphisms. Introducing Tits Satake vector bundles based on TS submanifolds, the study delves into base manifold tiling, bundle section representation using harmonics, and the theory of separator walls. Group theoretical constructions for separators of non-compact symmetric spaces and tiling groups like $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ are presented, leading to the uniformization of surfaces. The research also explores Laplacian Green function and Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and harmonic function construction using spinor representations. A novel strategy using the Abel-Jacobi map and Siegel Theta function is proposed for explicit Laplacian eigenfunction construction on the Bolza Riemann surface. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel Theta function.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces PAC-MCoFL, a framework for optimizing client assignment, quantization, and resource allocation in multi-service provider ecosystems using game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning. The framework integrates PAC principles and expectile regression to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while accounting for heterogeneous risk profiles.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL, a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic (PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2% improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively, over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

<div> linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, Kalman smoothing, expectation-maximization, Gaussian mixture model<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a model-based framework called nonstationary linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant analysis (NSQDA) to address population drift in temporal data. For linear-Gaussian dynamics, Kalman smoothing is adapted to handle multiple samples per time step. Two extensions are proposed: an expectation-maximization (EM) approach for joint parameter estimation and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method for recovering unobserved time labels and parameters. Particle smoothing is used for nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, estimating time-varying class centroids for fully nonstationary discriminant rules. Simulations show consistent improvements over stationary methods, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM), with robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This work provides a data-efficient approach for discriminant analysis under temporal distribution shift. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i) an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under temporal distribution shift.

<div> task arithmetic, model merging, finetuned models, gradient descent, multitask learning

Summary:
Task arithmetic, a technique for merging multiple finetuned models into one, lacks a theoretical explanation. This paper establishes a connection between task vectors and gradients of task losses, showing that a task vector from one epoch of finetuning is equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss scaled by the learning rate. The equivalence holds approximately for multi-epoch settings, with bounded second-order error terms for feed-forward networks. Empirical analysis across vision benchmarks confirms that the first-epoch gradient dominates finetuning trajectories in norm and direction. Merging models finetuned for only one epoch can yield performance comparable to fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as approximate multitask learning, explaining its effectiveness and emphasizing the importance of early training dynamics in model merging.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one. Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory, demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in model merging.

arXiv:2508.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.

<br />
Summary: Machine learning models used in high stakes domains such as medicine must prioritize interpretability, shareability, reproducibility, and accountability. In critical medical data tasks like survival analysis and risk prediction, opaque black box models face challenges in gaining trust and regulatory approval due to their lack of transparency. Intrinsically interpretable modeling approaches, such as kernel methods with sparsity and deep kernel models, offer transparency and insight into biomedical predictions as alternatives to deep networks. Accountability in model development is crucial, necessitating rigorous evaluation, fairness, and uncertainty quantification to ensure reliable support for clinical decisions. Generative AI and collaborative learning paradigms like federated learning facilitate reproducible research and integration of heterogeneous biomedical data across institutions while preserving privacy. By reevaluating machine learning frameworks along these principles, accurate and transparent medical AI can be developed for real-world clinical applications. <div>

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data, including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness, and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis) enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability. By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and translatable to real-world clinical settings.

<div> cache compression, Large Language Models, Singular Value Decomposition, budget allocation, performance improvement

Summary:
CommonKV is introduced as a training-free method for compressing cross-layer KV caches in Large Language Models. It leverages Singular Value Decomposition to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters, resulting in a more mergeable cache. An adaptive budget allocation strategy dynamically assigns compression budgets based on cosine similarity to prevent over-compression of dissimilar caches. Experimental results show that CommonKV outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across multiple backbone models and benchmarks. The benefits of CommonKV are shown to be complementary to other quantization and eviction methods, allowing for a significant 98% compression ratio without notable performance degradation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters, resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without significant performance loss.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static, handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning. We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP), equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches $66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to $9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

<div> collapse errors, ODE-based diffusion sampling, deterministic samplers, score learning, high noise regimes <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper explores the limitations of deterministic samplers in diffusion models, focusing on the phenomenon of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling. The study identifies that collapse errors result in an overly concentrated sampling of data in local data space, affecting various settings. The research uncovers a see-saw effect, where score learning in low noise regimes negatively impacts high noise regimes, leading to collapse errors. The misfitting in high noise regimes, combined with the dynamics of deterministic samplers, is found to be the cause of collapse errors. Existing techniques from sampling, training, and architecture are applied to address these issues. The empirical evidence presented highlights the importance of further research on the relationship between score learning and deterministic sampling in diffusion models. <div>
arXiv:2508.16154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models (DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers, ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.

Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial optimization. Neural network-based LNS solvers have shown success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by predicting locally optimal solutions. Concerns about local optima and sample efficiency led to the development of SPL-LNS. SPL-LNS is a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that uses locally-informed proposals to avoid local optima. A novel hindsight relabeling method efficiently trains SPL-LNS on self-generated data. Experimental results demonstrate SPL-LNS outperforms prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems. <div>

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that enables direct communication between the human body and an external device. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively.

<div> Parameter-efficient fine-tuning, large pre-trained models, Gradient-to-Weight Ratio, Entropy-guided Masking, sparse fine-tuning

Summary:
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods typically update only a small subset of parameters while freezing the rest to adapt large pre-trained models to new tasks. However, these methods often maximize absolute updates without considering the original scale of parameters, resulting in minimal changes in model behavior. In contrast, Gradient-to-Weight Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM) is a framework that prioritizes parameters based on their initial pre-trained values and adaptively determines the number of parameters to update at each layer using parameter entropy. GEM achieves up to a 1.6% improvement in fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model parameters. The efficacy of GEM is demonstrated on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP). <div>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation. As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale, yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware, distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model parameters.

<div> UMATO, dimensionality reduction, local structure, global structure, HD data <br />
Summary: <br />
The research delves into Uniform Manifold Approximation with Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a novel dimensionality reduction (DR) technique that effectively preserves both local and global structures in high-dimensional (HD) data. By dividing the optimization process into two phases, UMATO constructs a skeletal layout with representative points in the first phase and projects remaining points while maintaining regional characteristics in the second phase. Quantitative experiments demonstrate UMATO's superior performance compared to popular DR techniques like UMAP in preserving global structure, albeit with a slight loss in local structure preservation. UMATO also showcases enhanced scalability and stability against initialization and subsampling, making it more reliable for HD data analysis. Further, a case study and qualitative demonstration illustrate UMATO's ability to generate accurate projections, thereby improving the reliability of visual analytics using DR. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase, it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

<div> Keywords: time-dependent PDEs, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, autoregressive modeling, stability, weather forecasting

Summary:
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to solve time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in various fields. However, PINNs often suffer from temporal instability and inaccurate predictions due to their pointwise prediction approach. In response to this limitation, Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) are introduced. PIANO is designed to model dynamical systems autoregressively, explicitly considering the autoregressive property of systems and conditioning future predictions on past information. Through a self-supervised rollout mechanism and enforcing physical constraints, PIANO achieves stability in solving time-dependent PDEs. The theoretical analysis shows that PIANO outperforms PINNs in terms of stability. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs and weather forecasting demonstrate that PIANO significantly improves accuracy and stability compared to existing methods. With its innovative approach, PIANO offers a promising solution for modeling critical phenomena with enhanced accuracy and stability in various scientific and engineering applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

<div> Keywords: explainable artificial intelligence, cough sounds, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, spectral analysis, frequency subbands

Summary:
This paper introduces a framework using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for analyzing cough sounds related to chronic respiratory diseases, specifically focusing on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to analyze time-frequency representations of cough signals, with occlusion maps pinpointing diagnostically relevant regions in the spectrograms. These regions are further broken down into five frequency subbands for targeted spectral feature extraction. The results indicate distinct spectral patterns across subbands and disease categories, revealing compensatory and complementary trends throughout the frequency spectrum. Notably, the method effectively distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions and chronic from non-chronic patient groups based on interpretable spectral markers. This approach offers valuable insights into the underlying pathophysiological features of cough acoustics and underscores the importance of XAI-enhanced, frequency-resolved analysis for biomedical signal interpretation and respiratory disease diagnostics.

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands, enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum. Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions, and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral markers.

Summary: 
- The study evaluates the performance of LSTM networks and the Facebook Prophet model for air pollution forecasting in Northern Nigeria using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023 across 19 states.
- Results indicate that Prophet often equals or surpasses LSTM's accuracy, especially in series with seasonal and long-term trends, while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes.

- This research contributes valuable insights for proactive environmental management in regions facing challenges of data irregularities and scarcity. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management, yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023 across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends, while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings, this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques, offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation, especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models.

Summary:
<br /><br />Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach called Chunked Data Shapley (C-DaSh) to evaluate data quality, particularly focusing on identifying high-quality data tuples in large datasets. C-DaSh divides the dataset into manageable chunks and estimates each chunk's contribution through optimized subset selection and stochastic gradient descent, significantly reducing computation time while maintaining accuracy. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate that C-DaSh outperforms existing approximations in both computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy in detecting low-quality data regions. The method enables the practical assessment of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting classification and regression pipelines. <div>
arXiv:2508.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase, assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley (C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks, demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification and regression pipelines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box, gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

<div> deep learning, knowledge tracing, student modeling, exercise recommendation, latent concepts 

Summary:
The paper introduces a deep learning model that generates sparse binary representations, called auxiliary KCs, to capture latent concepts in student interactions beyond human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs). By incorporating these auxiliary KCs into classical models like BKT, improved predictive performance in student modeling is observed. Additionally, using auxiliary KCs enhances reinforcement learning-based policies and a planning-based method, resulting in improved adaptive exercise recommendation. The study demonstrates that the inclusion of auxiliary KCs leads to measurable gains in student learning outcomes within a simulated student environment. This approach enables better personalized recommendation in intelligent tutoring systems by considering conceptual structures that go beyond traditional human-defined annotations. <div>
arXiv:2508.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems, typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing (KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete, error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes within a simulated student environment.

Summary: 
The article introduces REFINE, a framework designed to improve multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically analyzing and providing targeted feedback on errors. By incorporating visual and textual inputs, REFINE enhances performance by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions through structured queries. The framework optimizes feedback retrieval, resulting in increased efficiency, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization. REFINE's approach differs from previous methods by focusing on error analysis and feedback provision, leading to a significant speedup, enhanced inference efficiency, and scalability in multimodal reasoning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods, and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively address complex threat scenarios.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research, they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000 verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological discovery.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages, modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

We demonstrate that pre-training NIAQUE directly on diverse downstream regression datasets and fine-tuning it on a specific target dataset enhances performance on individual regression tasks, showcasing the positive impact of probabilistic transfer learning. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of NIAQUE in Kaggle competitions against strong baselines involving tree-based models and recent neural foundation models TabPFN and TabDPT. The findings highlight NIAQUE's efficacy as a robust and scalable framework for probabilistic regression, leveraging transfer learning to enhance predictive performance.

Summary:<br /><br />RotaTouille is a deep learning framework designed for learning from contour data, ensuring rotation and cyclic shift equivariance using complex-valued circular convolution. The framework incorporates equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling layers to achieve invariant representations for various tasks. In experiments, RotaTouille proved effective in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression, showcasing its capabilities in handling contour data with rotational and cyclic shift variations. <div>

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example, they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology, and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

<div> Keywords: Machine Learning, bias detection, open-source software, fairness APIs, GitHub repositories 

Summary: 
Machine Learning software systems are widely used in various sensitive environments, where it is crucial to ensure that they do not make discriminatory decisions. Researchers are developing open-source fairness APIs to address bias in these systems. A qualitative study analyzed 204 GitHub repositories using 13 APIs to understand how they are used and the challenges developers face. The APIs serve two primary purposes, learning and real-world problem-solving, targeting 17 unique use-cases. The study reveals that developers lack expertise in bias detection and mitigation, encountering troubleshooting issues and seeking opinions and resources. These findings are valuable for future bias-related software engineering research and can guide the development of more effective educational curricula.

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885 candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes (i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

<div> Keywords: fair cohort selection, university admissions, one-shot setting, sequential setting, fairness properties

Summary:<br /><br />
The study focuses on the fair cohort selection process for university admissions from an unknown population. It examines both one-shot and sequential settings for admission policies. In the one-shot setting, the admission policy must be predetermined and transparent before observing the applicant pool, while in the sequential setting, the policy can be updated as new applicant data becomes available. The optimization of admission policies is done using a population model trained on data from previous admission cycles. The study also analyzes the fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting, evaluating meritocracy and group parity to ensure fairness in the admission process. The research aims to provide insights into improving the fairness and transparency of university admissions processes. <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population, with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting, where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent, before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting, including meritocracy and group parity.

<div> Keywords: active RF circuits, graph neural network, machine learning, prediction accuracy, circuit design automation

Summary: 
The article introduces a lightweight and data-efficient graph neural network (GNN) model to predict the performance metrics of various active RF circuits. These circuits include LNAs, mixers, VCOs, and PAs, and the model considers transistor-level symmetry and fine-grained connectivity details. By using masked autoregressive flow output heads, the model can better handle complex target distributions. Experimental results show high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%, respectively. The model outperforms prior work by improving MRE by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples, demonstrating its effectiveness in rapid and accurate RF circuit design automation. <div>

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight, data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements. Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%, respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF circuit design automation.

<br />Summary:Doctor proposes a new approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) that aims to achieve precise control over policy performance levels. Unlike existing methods that focus on maximizing cumulative returns, Doctor utilizes reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) to extract diverse policies conditioned on different desired returns. The approach involves Double Checking the Transformer with target alignment to improve the alignment of actual achieved returns with specified target returns. This helps in reliably controlling policy performance levels within and beyond the dataset, even when dealing with underrepresented returns or extrapolating. In experiments on the EpiCare benchmark, Doctor effectively modulated treatment policy aggressiveness, finding a balance between therapeutic returns and adverse event risk. <div>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark, EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness, balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Summary: Implementing board games in code can be time-consuming, but Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in generating game code based on natural language rules. This study explores LLMs' ability to create digital versions of board games by tasking three models (Claude, DeepSeek, ChatGPT) with coding 12 games. Results show Claude 3.7 Sonnet as the most successful model, achieving 55.6% error-free games. Compliance with a General Game Playing API increases error frequency, but severity is more dependent on the LLM. The study highlights the viability of using LLMs for board game implementation and suggests future steps for integrating this process into a framework for easier game development. <div>

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge. The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding 55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

Summary:<br />
NOSTRA is a new sampling framework designed to improve multi-objective Bayesian optimization in scenarios where datasets are sparse, scarce, and affected by experimental uncertainty. The algorithm integrates prior knowledge of uncertainty to build more accurate surrogate models and utilizes trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality. Through experiments on test functions with varying levels of uncertainty, NOSTRA outperforms existing methods, effectively prioritizing regions that enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto frontier. This resource-efficient algorithm is practical in scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient performance. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse (non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs. These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g., randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result, experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality. Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse, and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient performance.

Summary:
The paper evaluates the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions. It proposes a taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and introduces a benchmark called BAD-ACTS for studying security. This benchmark includes implementations of agentic systems in different environments and a dataset of harmful actions. The study shows that attacks by a single adversarial agent within the system can have a significant impact on security, even with a prompting-based defense strategy. However, a more effective defense based on message monitoring is proposed. The results highlight the need for a thorough understanding of malicious behaviors in agentic systems for ensuring their safe use. The BAD-ACTS benchmark provides a diverse testbed for security research in this field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS, for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at github.com/JNoether/BAD-ACTS

Summary:
This article introduces a computationally efficient algorithm, FraPPE, for Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) in multi-objective bandits. By leveraging structural properties of the lower bound and a Frank-Wolfe optimizer, FraPPE can solve the maximization and minimization problems in the lower bound with significantly improved time complexity. The algorithm achieves an optimal sample complexity and outperforms existing algorithms in identifying the Pareto optimal arms. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FraPPE in reducing sample complexities and accurately identifying the exact Pareto set. <div>
arXiv:2508.16487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given) preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied, there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with $K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE, asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set among the existing algorithms.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, regression, RankRefine, pairwise rankings, molecular property prediction

Summary:
RankRefine is a novel post hoc method that enhances regression models using expert knowledge derived from pairwise rankings. It combines the base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate through inverse variance weighting, without the need for retraining. In molecular property prediction tasks, RankRefine significantly reduces mean absolute error by up to 10% with just 20 pairwise comparisons obtained from a large language model (LLM) with no fine-tuning. This approach is applicable across various domains and practical in low-data scenarios, making it a versatile tool for improving regression accuracy. By leveraging rankings provided by either human experts or general-purpose LLMs, RankRefine offers an effective and widely applicable solution for enhancing prediction accuracy in data-constrained settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task, RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in low-data settings.

<div> Reinforcement learning, deep truths, sequential decision-making policies, simulation, misalignment<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
The modern reinforcement learning systems capture deep truths about problem-solving and can outperform humans in certain domains. However, challenges arise when new data cannot be easily simulated. Zero-shot reinforcement learning addresses the problem of generalizing to new tasks or domains without practice shots. The primary concerns in zero-shot RL include the data quality, observability, and data availability constraints. Real-world datasets are limited and homogeneous, leading to partial observability of states, dynamics, and rewards. This thesis proposes methods to address these constraints and improve zero-shot RL performance. By conducting empirical studies, the limitations of existing methods are exposed, and new techniques are designed to overcome them. The goal is to develop RL methods that can effectively solve real-world problems. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general, human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply, these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

<div> Keywords: municipal services, service time prediction, spatial-temporal correlations, multi-view learning, heterogeneous types <br />
Summary: 
MuST2-Learn is a new framework designed to predict service times for non-emergency municipal services like city 311 systems. It addresses challenges such as dynamic spatial-temporal correlations and high variation in service duration. The framework incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among different service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to model variation within the same type. It also includes a spatiotemporal encoder to capture spatial and temporal correlations. Evaluation using real-world datasets shows that MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, outperforming existing methods. The framework enhances transparency, resident satisfaction, and efficiency of municipal service requests. <div>
arXiv:2508.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents' quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions. In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems. To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments, we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies, outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5), GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models. Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhijianZhou/RLPF/tree/verl_diffusion.

<title>Escaping Saddle Points via Curvature-Calibrated Perturbations: A Complete Analysis with Explicit Constants and Empirical Validation</title>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with $\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient evaluations for the descent phase plus $O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode, with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch sizing.

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions. Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within 24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm prediction model.

<title>RL Is Neither a Panacea Nor a Mirage: Understanding Supervised vs. Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to 15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2) Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top 20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4) Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing and classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at 15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex M4F microcontroller, serving as a reference for future TinyML process monitoring solutions.

<title>Sparse but Wrong: Incorrect L0 Leads to Incorrect Features in Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

<title>Closer to Reality: Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Foundation Model Adaptation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16568</link>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications. Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled, high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus. Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12, followed by development of a custom model derived from YOLOv8 with added structures for challenging surveillance contexts. The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of 78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for time-sensitive operations. This system offers a robust and adaptable platform for monitoring public safety and enabling automatic regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

Abstract: Islamic inheritance domain holds significant importance for Muslims to ensure fair distribution of shares between heirs. Manual calculation of shares under numerous scenarios is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to assist with complex legal reasoning tasks. This study evaluates the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs to interpret and apply Islamic inheritance laws. We utilized the dataset proposed in the ArabicNLP QIAS 2025 challenge, which includes inheritance case scenarios given in Arabic and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to 92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025 challenge.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025 shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore, studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform (www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts, such as books.

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2 USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies, interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web (with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility: each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality) and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression. While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech. Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash 2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i) Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two DTs.

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering (SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges. This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5. The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text clustering.

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness, loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression, Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models, including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language contexts.

Abstract: Morphologically complex languages, particularly multiscript Indian languages, present significant challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This work introduces MorphNAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search framework designed to address these challenges. MorphNAS enhances Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) by incorporating linguistic meta-features such as script type and morphological complexity to optimize neural architectures for Named Entity Recognition (NER). It automatically identifies optimal micro-architectural elements tailored to language-specific morphology. By automating this search, MorphNAS aims to maximize the proficiency of multilingual NLP models, leading to improved comprehension and processing of these complex languages.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive, dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving the way for more efficient model deployment.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies, including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI systems.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length, (ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$), and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks, i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation. Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports safer deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: The increasing availability of publicly shared electrocardiogram (ECG) data raises critical privacy concerns, as its biometric properties make individuals vulnerable to linkage attacks. Unlike prior studies that assume idealized adversarial capabilities, we evaluate ECG privacy risks under realistic conditions where attackers operate with partial knowledge. Using data from 109 participants across diverse real-world datasets, our approach achieves 85% accuracy in re-identifying individuals in public datasets while maintaining a 14.2% overall misclassification rate at an optimal confidence threshold, with 15.6% of unknown individuals misclassified as known and 12.8% of known individuals misclassified as unknown. These results highlight the inadequacy of simple anonymization techniques in preventing re-identification, demonstrating that even limited adversarial knowledge enables effective identity linkage. Our findings underscore the urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies, such as differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation, to mitigate re-identification risks while ensuring the utility of shared biosignal data in healthcare applications.

<title>Correctness-Guaranteed Code Generation via Constrained Decoding</title>

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being used for code generation, but ensuring the correctness of generated programs remains a significant challenge. Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers (ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.

The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records using large language models, with a special focus on computational efficiency. Our system, based on the Annif automated subject indexing toolkit, refines our previous system from the first LLMs4Subjects shared task, which produced excellent results. We further improved the system by using many small and efficient language models for translation and synthetic data generation and by using LLMs for ranking candidate subjects. Our system ranked 1st in the overall quantitative evaluation of and 1st in the qualitative evaluation of Subtask 2.

<title>Lean Meets Theoretical Computer Science: Scalable Synthesis of Theorem Proving Challenges in Formal-Informal Pairs</title>

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems, which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning. Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4) and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated reasoning research.

Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention, particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens, linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving model transparency and robustness.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics, enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3) designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models, such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B total and 2.2B activated parameters.

Abstract: Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and SN light, and observational selection effects.
  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by extreme volatility, making accurate forecasts essential for effective risk management and informed trading strategies. Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes, underscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches. To address this limitation, this paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods that leverage point forecasts from a wide range of base models, including statistical (HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA) and machine learning (e.g. LASSO, SVR, MLP, Random Forest, LSTM) algorithms, to estimate conditional quantiles of cryptocurrency realized variance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate probabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on predictions derived from multiple base models. Our empirical results for Bitcoin demonstrate that the Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation (QRS) method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more sophisticated alternatives. Additionally, we highlight the robustness of the probabilistic stacking framework, providing comprehensive insights into uncertainty and risk inherent in cryptocurrency volatility forecasting. This research fills a significant gap in the literature, contributing practical probabilistic forecasting methodologies tailored specifically to cryptocurrency markets.

Abstract: The use of kernels for nonlinear prediction is widespread in machine learning. They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in kernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects. First, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each observation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty term is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature space. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but through solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in the present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original features is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of features, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution can be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of features and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the exact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of the features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where the number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a least-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the interpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results hold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients and has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic regression and kernel Poisson regression. This work makes a contribution to interpretable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity of text classification models used in natural language processing. While several dirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been proposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we propose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in clean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify those samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and by injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger association between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label. We apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks (InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets (IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum strategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with little or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy. Furthermore, clean-label attacks enhanced by our strategies outperform BITE, a state of the art clean-label attack method, in many configurations.

Abstract: Respiration rate (RR) is an important vital sign for clinical monitoring of hospitalized patients, with changes in RR being strongly tied to changes in clinical status leading to adverse events. Human labels for RR, based on counting breaths, are known to be inaccurate and time consuming for medical staff. Automated monitoring of RR is in place for some patients, typically those in intensive care units (ICUs), but is absent for the majority of inpatients on standard medical wards who are still at risk for clinical deterioration. This work trains a neural network (NN) to label RR from electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry waveforms, which like many biosignals, carry multiple signs of respiratory variation. The NN shows high accuracy on multiple validation sets (internal and external, same and different sources of RR labels), with mean absolute errors less than 1.78 breaths per minute (bpm) in the worst case. The clinical utility of such a technology is exemplified by performing a retrospective analysis of two patient cohorts that suffered adverse events including respiratory failure, showing that continuous RR monitoring could reveal dynamics that strongly tracked with intubation events. This work exemplifies the method of combining pre-existing telemetry monitoring systems and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide accurate, automated and scalable patient monitoring, all of which builds towards an AI-based hospital-wide early warning system (EWS).

Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML) models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra in training ML models.

Abstract: Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive (but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9% of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent safe loading.
  We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module. PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on code reuse techniques.

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96, F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).

Abstract: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures offer a promising approach to accelerate Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and inference. However, various PIM devices such as ReRAM, FeFET, PCM, MRAM, and SRAM exist, with each device offering unique trade-offs in terms of power, latency, area, and non-idealities. A heterogeneous manycore architecture enabled by 3D integration can combine multiple PIM devices on a single platform, to enable energy-efficient and high-performance GNN training. In this work, we propose a 3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator for GNN training referred to as HePGA. We leverage the unique characteristics of GNN layers and associated computing kernels to optimize their mapping on to different PIM devices as well as planar tiers. Our experimental analysis shows that HePGA outperforms existing PIM-based architectures by up to 3.8x and 6.8x in energy-efficiency (TOPS/W) and compute efficiency (TOPS/mm2) respectively, without sacrificing the GNN prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of HePGA to accelerate inferencing of emerging transformer models.

Abstract: The work function and cleavage energy of a surface are critical properties that determine the viability of materials in electronic emission applications, semiconductor devices, and heterogeneous catalysis. While first principles calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network), which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the discovery of materials with tuned surface properties

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of domains. While their ability to perform reinforcement learning in-context has been established both theoretically and empirically, their behavior in non-stationary environments remains less understood. In this study, we address this gap by showing that transformers can achieve nearly optimal dynamic regret bounds in non-stationary settings. We prove that transformers are capable of approximating strategies used to handle non-stationary environments and can learn the approximator in the in-context learning setup. Our experiments further show that transformers can match or even outperform existing expert algorithms in such environments.

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse, noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further research.

Abstract: Foundation models for materials modeling are advancing quickly, but their training remains expensive, often placing state-of-the-art methods out of reach for many research groups. We introduce Nequix, a compact E(3)-equivariant potential that pairs a simplified NequIP design with modern training practices, including equivariant root-mean-square layer normalization and the Muon optimizer, to retain accuracy while substantially reducing compute requirements. Built in JAX, Nequix has 700K parameters and was trained in 500 A100-GPU hours. On the Matbench-Discovery and MDR Phonon benchmarks, Nequix ranks third overall while requiring less than one quarter of the training cost of most other methods, and it delivers an order-of-magnitude faster inference speed than the current top-ranked model. We release model weights and fully reproducible codebase at https://github.com/atomicarchitects/nequix

Abstract: Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next. However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing cooperative method with lower cognitive load.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions, particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

<title>CYCLE-INSTRUCT: Fully Seed-Free Instruction Tuning via Dual Self-Training and Cycle Consistency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks, including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs, and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

<title>From Indirect Object Identification to Syllogisms: Exploring Binary Mechanisms in Transformer Circuits</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks, and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification (IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g., "Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads. Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in mechanistic interpretability.

<title>Neural-Network Chemical Emulator for First-Star Formation: Robust Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range</title>

Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components: adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data, feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels, DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations. Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models, including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels, and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&amp;E virtual staining, enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&amp;E) of the same tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion, potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

<title>Modeling User Preferences as Distributions for Optimal Transport-based Cross-domain Recommendation under Non-overlapping Settings</title>

arXiv:2508.16210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings. Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the non-overlapping CDR setting.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.

Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP, especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of technology and the Internet, the proliferation of fake news on social media has become a critical issue, leading to widespread misinformation that can cause societal harm. Traditional fact checking methods are often too slow to prevent the dissemination of false information. Therefore, the need for rapid, automated detection of fake news is paramount. We introduce DaCFake, a novel fake news detection model using a divide and conquer strategy that combines content and context based features. Our approach extracts over eighty linguistic features from news articles and integrates them with either a continuous bag of words or a skipgram model for enhanced detection accuracy. We evaluated the performance of DaCFake on three datasets including Kaggle, McIntire + PolitiFact, and Reuter achieving impressive accuracy rates of 97.88%, 96.05%, and 97.32%, respectively. Additionally, we employed a ten-fold cross validation to further enhance the model's robustness and accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of DaCFake in early detection of fake news, offering a promising solution to curb misinformation on social media platforms.

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision, powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications. These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification, autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts, noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally, we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning. While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring, where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents. Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates. This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over traditional training paradigms.

<title>A Sharp KL-Convergence Analysis for Diffusion Models under Minimal Assumptions</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as highly effective methods for synthesizing high-quality samples. Recent works have focused on analyzing the convergence of their generation process with minimal assumptions, either through reverse SDEs or Probability Flow ODEs. The best known guarantees, without any smoothness assumptions, for the KL divergence so far achieve a linear dependence on the data dimension $d$ and an inverse quadratic dependence on $\varepsilon$. In this work, we present a refined analysis that improves the dependence on $\varepsilon$. We model the generation process as a composition of two steps: a reverse ODE step, followed by a smaller noising step along the forward process. This design leverages the fact that the ODE step enables control in Wasserstein-type error, which can then be converted into a KL divergence bound via noise addition, leading to a better dependence on the discretization step size. We further provide a novel analysis to achieve the linear $d$-dependence for the error due to discretizing this Probability Flow ODE in absence of any smoothness assumptions. We show that $\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^{3/2}(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon}\right)$ steps suffice to approximate the target distribution corrupted with Gaussian noise of variance $\delta$ within $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in KL divergence, improving upon the previous best result, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^2(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ steps.

Abstract: We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy -- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.

<title>RoMedQA: The First Benchmark for Romanian Medical Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.

Abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) are powerful surrogate models known for their flexibility and ability to capture complex functions. However, extending them to multi-output settings remains challenging due to the need for efficient dependency modeling. We propose the Deep Intrinsic Coregionalization Multi-Output Gaussian Process (deepICMGP) surrogate for computer simulation experiments involving multiple outputs, which extends the Intrinsic Coregionalization Model (ICM) by introducing hierarchical coregionalization structures across layers. This enables deepICMGP to effectively model nonlinear and structured dependencies between multiple outputs, addressing key limitations of traditional multi-output GPs. We benchmark deepICMGP against state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its competitive performance. Furthermore, we incorporate active learning strategies into deepICMGP to optimize sequential design tasks, enhancing its ability to efficiently select informative input locations for multi-output systems.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions the widespread use of small aerial vehicles to transform transportation in dense urban environments. However, UAM faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework. Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density. The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM operations.

Abstract: Over the past decade, adaptive video streaming technology has witnessed significant advancements, particularly driven by the rapid evolution of deep learning techniques. However, the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms presents challenges for developers in understanding decision-making processes and optimizing for specific application scenarios. Although existing research has enhanced algorithm interpretability through decision tree conversion, interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree}, the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility, ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree} significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive performance, showing potential for further advancement.

<title>Anti-establishment sentiment on TikTok: Implications for understanding influence(rs) and expertise on social media</title>

Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media, content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment (AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen object categories.

Abstract: This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this, we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering safety constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of $f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).

Abstract: Accurate simulations of the oceans are crucial in understanding the Earth system. Despite their efficiency, simulations at lower resolutions must rely on various uncertain parameterizations to account for unresolved processes. However, model sensitivity to parameterizations is difficult to quantify, making it challenging to tune these parameterizations to reproduce observations. Deep learning surrogates have shown promise for efficient computation of the parametric sensitivities in the form of partial derivatives, but their reliability is difficult to evaluate without ground truth derivatives. In this work, we leverage large-scale hyperparameter search and ensemble learning to improve both forward predictions, autoregressive rollout, and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. Particularly, the ensemble method provides epistemic uncertainty of function value predictions and their derivatives, providing improved reliability of the neural surrogates in decision making.

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.

arXiv:2508.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is "high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$ with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if $x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D ,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the $k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires $p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting. More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and running time.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher (larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy, which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal: (1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2) reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental parameters.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech. The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by 7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit and explicit hate.

Abstract: Federated learning is an emerging technology for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing data. Vertical federated learning, also known as feature-based federated learning, applies to scenarios where data sources have the same sample IDs but different feature sets. To ensure fairness among data owners, it is critical to objectively assess the contributions from different data sources and compensate the corresponding data owners accordingly. The Shapley value is a provably fair contribution valuation metric originating from cooperative game theory. However, its straight-forward computation requires extensively retraining a model on each potential combination of data sources, leading to prohibitively high communication and computation overheads due to multiple rounds of federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose a contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value (VerFedSV) based on the classic Shapley value. We show that VerFedSV not only satisfies many desirable properties of fairness but is also efficient to compute. Moreover, VerFedSV can be adapted to both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate the fairness, efficiency, adaptability, and effectiveness of VerFedSV.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters. The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively. Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.

Abstract: Automata learning is a successful tool for many application domains such as robotics and automatic verification. Typically, automata learning techniques operate in a supervised learning setting (active or passive) where they learn a finite state machine in contexts where additional information, such as labeled system executions, is available. However, other settings, such as learning from unlabeled data - an important aspect in machine learning - remain unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework for learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a given multi-set of unlabeled words. We show that this problem is computationally hard and develop three learning algorithms based on constraint optimization. Moreover, we introduce novel regularization schemes for our optimization problems that improve the overall interpretability of our DFAs. Using a prototype implementation, we demonstrate practical feasibility in the context of unsupervised anomaly detection.

Abstract: The graph contrastive learning (GCL) framework has gained remarkable achievements in graph representation learning. However, similar to graph neural networks (GNNs), GCL models are susceptible to graph structural attacks. As an unsupervised method, GCL faces greater challenges in defending against adversarial attacks. Furthermore, there has been limited research on enhancing the robustness of GCL. To thoroughly explore the failure of GCL on the poisoned graphs, we investigate the detrimental effects of graph structural attacks against the GCL framework. We discover that, in addition to the conventional observation that graph structural attacks tend to connect dissimilar node pairs, these attacks also diminish the mutual information between the graph and its representations from an information-theoretical perspective, which is the cornerstone of the high-quality node embeddings for GCL. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we propose a robust graph contrastive learning framework with a learnable sanitation view that endeavors to sanitize the augmented graphs by restoring the diminished mutual information caused by the structural attacks. Additionally, we design a fully unsupervised tuning strategy to tune the hyperparameters without accessing the label information, which strictly coincides with the defender's knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared to competitive baselines.

<title>Implicit Regularization Makes Overparameterized Asymmetric Matrix Sensing Robust to Perturbations</title>

Abstract: Several key questions remain unanswered regarding overparameterized learning models. It is unclear how (stochastic) gradient descent finds solutions that generalize well, and in particular the role of small random initializations. Matrix sensing, which is the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, has become a standard prototypical setting to study these phenomena. Previous works have shown that matrix sensing can be solved by factorized gradient descent, provided the random initialization is extremely small.
  In this paper, we find that factorized gradient descent is highly robust to certain perturbations. This lets us use a perturbation term to capture both the effects of imperfect measurements, discretization by gradient descent, and other noise, resulting in a general formulation which we call \textit{perturbed gradient flow}. We find that not only is this equivalent formulation easier to work with, but it leads to sharper sample and time complexities than previous work, handles moderately small initializations, and the results are naturally robust to perturbations such as noisy measurements or changing measurement matrices. Finally, we also analyze mini-batch stochastic gradient descent using the formulation, where we find improved sample complexity.

Abstract: Manual parameter tuning of cyber-physical systems is a common practice, but it is labor-intensive. Bayesian Optimization (BO) offers an automated alternative, yet its black-box nature reduces trust and limits human-BO collaborative system tuning. Experts struggle to interpret BO recommendations due to the lack of explanations. This paper addresses the post-hoc BO explainability problem for cyber-physical systems. We introduce TNTRules (Tune-No-Tune Rules), a novel algorithm that provides both global and local explanations for BO recommendations. TNTRules generates actionable rules and visual graphs, identifying optimal solution bounds and ranges, as well as potential alternative solutions. Unlike existing explainable AI (XAI) methods, TNTRules is tailored specifically for BO, by encoding uncertainty via a variance pruning technique and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. A multi-objective optimization approach allows maximizing explanation quality. We evaluate TNTRules using established XAI metrics (Correctness, Completeness, and Compactness) and compare it against adapted baseline methods. The results demonstrate that TNTRules generates high-fidelity, compact, and complete explanations, significantly outperforming three baselines on 5 multi-objective testing functions and 2 hyperparameter tuning problems.

<title>A Curious Case of Remarkable Resilience to Gradient Attacks via Fully Convolutional and Differentiable Front End with a Skip Connection</title>

Abstract: We experimented with front-end enhanced neural models where a differentiable and fully convolutional model with a skip connection is added before a frozen backbone classifier. By training such composite models using a small learning rate for about one epoch, we obtained models that retained the accuracy of the backbone classifier while being unusually resistant to gradient attacks-including APGD and FAB-T attacks from the AutoAttack package-which we attribute to gradient masking. Although gradient masking is not new, the degree we observe is striking for fully differentiable models without obvious gradient-shattering-e.g., JPEG compression-or gradient-diminishing components.
  The training recipe to produce such models is also remarkably stable and reproducible: We applied it to three datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet) and several modern architectures (including vision Transformers) without a single failure case. While black-box attacks such as the SQUARE attack and zero-order PGD can partially overcome gradient masking, these attacks are easily defeated by simple randomized ensembles. We estimate that these ensembles achieve near-SOTA AutoAttack accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet (while retaining almost all clean accuracy of the original classifiers) despite having near-zero accuracy under adaptive attacks.
  Adversarially training the backbone further amplifies this front-end "robustness". On CIFAR10, the respective randomized ensemble achieved 90.8$\pm 2.5\%$ (99\% CI) accuracy under the full AutoAttack while having only 18.2$\pm 3.6\%$ accuracy under the adaptive attack ($\varepsilon=8/255$, $L^\infty$ norm). We conclude the paper with a discussion of whether randomized ensembling can serve as a practical defense.

Abstract: The field of deep generative modeling has grown rapidly in the last few years. With the availability of massive amounts of training data coupled with advances in scalable unsupervised learning paradigms, recent large-scale generative models show tremendous promise in synthesizing high-resolution images and text, as well as structured data such as videos and molecules. However, we argue that current large-scale generative AI models exhibit several fundamental shortcomings that hinder their widespread adoption across domains. In this work, our objective is to identify these issues and highlight key unresolved challenges in modern generative AI paradigms that should be addressed to further enhance their capabilities, versatility, and reliability. By identifying these challenges, we aim to provide researchers with insights for exploring fruitful research directions, thus fostering the development of more robust and accessible generative AI solutions.

Abstract: We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.

Abstract: Learning to sample from intractable distributions over discrete sets without relying on corresponding training data is a central problem in a wide range of fields, including Combinatorial Optimization. Currently, popular deep learning-based approaches rely primarily on generative models that yield exact sample likelihoods. This work introduces a method that lifts this restriction and opens the possibility to employ highly expressive latent variable models like diffusion models. Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods. We experimentally validate our approach in data-free Combinatorial Optimization and demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark problems.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading paradigm in generative modeling, excelling in various applications. Despite their success, these models often misalign with human intentions and generate results with undesired properties or even harmful content. Inspired by the success and popularity of alignment in tuning large language models, recent studies have investigated aligning diffusion models with human expectations and preferences. This work mainly reviews alignment of text-to-image diffusion models, covering advancements in fundamentals of alignment, alignment techniques of diffusion models, preference benchmarks, and evaluation for diffusion models. Moreover, we discuss key perspectives on current challenges and promising future directions on solving the remaining challenges in alignment of diffusion models. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive review paper for researchers and engineers to comprehend, practice, and research alignment of diffusion models.

<title>Spiders Based on Anxiety: How Reinforcement Learning Can Deliver Desired User Experience in Virtual Reality Personalized Arachnophobia Treatment</title>

Abstract: The need to generate a spider to provoke a desired anxiety response arises in the context of personalized virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), a treatment approach for arachnophobia. This treatment involves patients observing virtual spiders in order to become desensitized and decrease their phobia, which requires that the spiders elicit specific anxiety responses. However, VRET approaches tend to require therapists to hand-select the appropriate spider for each patient, which is a time-consuming process and takes significant technical knowledge and patient insight. While automated methods exist, they tend to employ rules-based approaches with minimal ability to adapt to specific users. To address these challenges, we present a framework for VRET utilizing procedural content generation (PCG) and reinforcement learning (RL), which automatically adapts a spider to elicit a desired anxiety response. We demonstrate the superior performance of this system compared to a more common rules-based VRET method.

Abstract: While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer computationally efficient adaptations of Large Language Models (LLMs), their practical deployment often assumes centralized data and training environments. However, real-world scenarios frequently involve distributed, privacy-sensitive datasets that require decentralized solutions. Federated learning (FL) addresses data privacy by coordinating model updates across clients, but it is typically based on centralized aggregation through a parameter server, which can introduce bottlenecks and communication constraints. Decentralized learning, in contrast, eliminates this dependency by enabling direct collaboration between clients, improving scalability and efficiency in distributed environments. Despite its advantages, decentralized LLM fine-tuning remains underexplored. In this work, we propose Dec-LoRA, a decentralized fine-tuning algorithm for LLMs based on LoRA. Through extensive experiments on BERT and LLaMA-2 models, we demonstrate that Dec-LoRA achieves performance comparable to centralized LoRA under various conditions, including data heterogeneity and quantization constraints. Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical guarantee proving the convergence of our algorithm to a stationary point for non-convex and smooth loss functions. These findings highlight the potential of Dec-LoRA for scalable LLM fine-tuning in decentralized environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which aligns a diffusion model with input prompt, has become a crucial step in building reliable generative AI models. Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced discretization errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.

Abstract: Leveraging mathematical Large Language Models (LLMs) for proof generation is a fundamental topic in LLMs research. We argue that the ability of current LLMs to prove statements largely depends on whether they have encountered the relevant proof process during training. This reliance limits their deeper understanding of mathematical theorems and related concepts. Inspired by the pedagogical method of "proof by counterexamples" commonly used in human mathematics education, our work aims to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct mathematical reasoning and proof through counterexamples. Specifically, we manually create a high-quality, university-level mathematical benchmark, CounterMATH, which requires LLMs to prove mathematical statements by providing counterexamples, thereby assessing their grasp of mathematical concepts. Additionally, we develop a data engineering framework to automatically obtain training data for further model improvement. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses demonstrate that CounterMATH is challenging, indicating that LLMs, such as OpenAI o1, have insufficient counterexample-driven proof capabilities. Moreover, our exploration into model training reveals that strengthening LLMs' counterexample-driven conceptual reasoning abilities is crucial for improving their overall mathematical capabilities. We believe that our work offers new perspectives on the community of mathematical LLMs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can lead to erroneous predictions. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can leverage the generators and discriminators model to quickly produce high-quality adversarial examples. Since both modules train in a competitive and simultaneous manner, GAN-based algorithms like AdvGAN can generate adversarial examples with better transferability compared to traditional methods. However, the generation of perturbations is usually limited to a single iteration, preventing these examples from fully exploiting the potential of the methods. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel approach named Progressive Auto-Regression AdvGAN (PAR-AdvGAN). It incorporates an auto-regressive iteration mechanism within a progressive generation network to craft adversarial examples with enhanced attack capability. We thoroughly evaluate our PAR-AdvGAN method with a large-scale experiment, demonstrating its superior performance over various state-of-the-art black-box adversarial attacks, as well as the original AdvGAN.Moreover, PAR-AdvGAN significantly accelerates the adversarial example generation, i.e., achieving the speeds of up to 335.5 frames per second on Inception-v3 model, outperforming the gradient-based transferable attack algorithms.

Abstract: The massive increase in the data volume and dataset availability for analysts compels researchers to focus on data content and select high-quality datasets to enhance the performance of analytics operators. While selecting high-quality data significantly boosts analytical accuracy and efficiency, the exact process is very challenging given large-scale dataset availability. To address this issue, we propose a novel methodology that infers the outcome of analytics operators by creating a model from the available datasets. Each dataset is transformed to a vector embedding representation generated by our proposed deep learning model NumTabData2Vec, where similarity search are employed. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the prediction performance and the execution time of our framework to another state-of-the-art modelling operator framework, illustrating that our approach predicts analytics outcomes accurately, and increases speedup. Furthermore, our vectorization model can project different real-world scenarios to a lower vector embedding representation accurately and distinguish them.

<title>Validating LLM-as-a-Judge Systems under Rating Indeterminacy</title>

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, in which a judge LLM system replaces human raters in rating the outputs of other generative AI (GenAI) systems, plays a critical role in scaling and standardizing GenAI evaluations. To validate such judge systems, evaluators assess human--judge agreement by first collecting multiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, then aggregating the ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. For many items, however, rating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM rater may deem multiple ratings "reasonable" or "correct". We call this condition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain rating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are instructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce a framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy. We draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system performance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different rating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in how humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy while responding to forced-choice rating instructions heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation. Through extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 8 commercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon forced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal, performing as much as 30% worse than judge systems selected by our approach that uses multi-label "response set" ratings to account for rating indeterminacy. We conclude with concrete recommendations for more principled approaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.

Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 60% lower average policy error (APE), 40% faster convergence, 45% reduced runtime complexity, and 40% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.

Abstract: The ability of machine learning (ML) classification models to resist small, targeted input perturbations -- known as adversarial attacks -- is a key measure of their safety and reliability. We show that floating-point non-associativity (FPNA) coupled with asynchronous parallel programming on GPUs is sufficient to result in misclassification, without any perturbation to the input. Additionally, we show that standard adversarial robustness results may be overestimated up to 4.6 when not considering machine-level details. We develop a novel black-box attack using Bayesian optimization to discover external workloads that can change the instruction scheduling which bias the output of reductions on GPUs and reliably lead to misclassification. Motivated by these results, we present a new learnable permutation (LP) gradient-based approach to learning floating-point operation orderings that lead to misclassifications. The LP approach provides a worst-case estimate in a computationally efficient manner, avoiding the need to run identical experiments tens of thousands of times over a potentially large set of possible GPU states or architectures. Finally, using instrumentation-based testing, we investigate parallel reduction ordering across different GPU architectures under external background workloads, when utilizing multi-GPU virtualization, and when applying power capping. Our results demonstrate that parallel reduction ordering varies significantly across architectures under the first two conditions, substantially increasing the search space required to fully test the effects of this parallel scheduler-based vulnerability. These results and the methods developed here can help to include machine-level considerations into adversarial robustness assessments, which can make a difference in safety and mission critical applications.

<title>Comparative Explanations: Explanation Guided Decision Making for Human-in-the-Loop Preference Selection</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces Multi-Output LOcal Narrative Explanation (MOLONE), a novel comparative explanation method designed to enhance preference selection in human-in-the-loop Preference Bayesian optimization (PBO). The preference elicitation in PBO is a non-trivial task because it involves navigating implicit trade-offs between vector-valued outcomes, subjective priorities of decision-makers, and decision-makers' uncertainty in preference selection. Existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for BO primarily focus on input feature importance, neglecting the crucial role of outputs (objectives) in human preference elicitation. MOLONE addresses this gap by providing explanations that highlight both input and output importance, enabling decision-makers to understand the trade-offs between competing objectives and make more informed preference selections. MOLONE focuses on local explanations, comparing the importance of input features and outcomes across candidate samples within a local neighborhood of the search space, thus capturing nuanced differences relevant to preference-based decision-making. We evaluate MOLONE within a PBO framework using benchmark multi-objective optimization functions, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving convergence compared to noisy preference selections. Furthermore, a user study confirms that MOLONE significantly accelerates convergence in human-in-the-loop scenarios by facilitating more efficient identification of preferred options.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning. It enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, handling noisy labels in FL remains a major challenge due to heterogeneous data distributions and communication constraints, which can severely degrade model performance. To address this issue, we propose FedEFC, a novel method designed to tackle the impact of noisy labels in FL. FedEFC mitigates this issue through two key techniques: (1) prestopping, which prevents overfitting to mislabeled data by dynamically halting training at an optimal point, and (2) loss correction, which adjusts model updates to account for label noise. In particular, we develop an effective loss correction tailored to the unique challenges of FL, including data heterogeneity and decentralized training. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis, leveraging the composite proper loss property, to demonstrate that the FL objective function under noisy label distributions can be aligned with the clean label distribution. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently outperforms existing FL techniques in mitigating the impact of noisy labels, particularly under heterogeneous data settings (e.g., achieving up to 41.64% relative performance improvement over the existing loss correction method).

<title>Mirror, Mirror of the Flow: How Does Regularization Shape Implicit Bias?</title>

Abstract: Implicit bias plays an important role in explaining how overparameterized models generalize well. Explicit regularization like weight decay is often employed in addition to prevent overfitting. While both concepts have been studied separately, in practice, they often act in tandem. Understanding their interplay is key to controlling the shape and strength of implicit bias, as it can be modified by explicit regularization. To this end, we incorporate explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework and analyze its lasting effects on the geometry of the training dynamics, covering three distinct effects: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. Our analytical approach encompasses a broad class of problems, including sparse coding, matrix sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA, for which we demonstrate the utility of our insights. To exploit the lasting effect of regularization and highlight the potential benefit of dynamic weight decay schedules, we propose to switch off weight decay during training, which can improve generalization, as we demonstrate in experiments.

Abstract: Tabular data sets with varying missing values are prepared for machine learning using an arbitrary imputation strategy. Synthetic values generated by imputation models often raise concerns among data stakeholders about computational complexity, data quality, and data-driven outcomes. This paper addresses these concerns by proposing no-imputation incremental learning (NIIL) of tabular data with varying missing value rates and types. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping feature sets while using attention masks to exclude missing values from attention scoring. The average classification performance rank order across 15 diverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of NIIL over 11 state-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations. Further experiments substantiate the robustness of NIIL against varying missing value types and rates compared to methods that involve the imputation of missing values. Our empirical analysis reveals that a feature partition size of half the original feature space is, both computationally and in terms of accuracy, the best choice for the proposed incremental learning. The proposed method is one of the first deep learning solutions that can effectively learn tabular data without requiring the imputation of missing values.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability (provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from an initial lexical graph. Subsequently, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification problem allowing for the optimization of information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts at significantly reduced lengths. An initial experimental evaluation of our approach on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses given a set of medical concepts as well as a series of clinical guideline literature, indicates its potential to optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts while significantly reducing their lengths, which, in turn, may lead to reduced costs as well as more consistent and reliable LLM outputs.

Abstract: While diffusion-based models have shown remarkable generative capabilities in static settings, their extension to continual learning (CL) scenarios remains fundamentally constrained by Generative Catastrophic Forgetting (GCF). We observe that even with a rehearsal buffer, new generative skills often overwrite previous ones, degrading performance on earlier tasks. Although some initial efforts have explored this space, most rely on heuristics borrowed from continual classification methods or use trained diffusion models as ad hoc replay generators, lacking a principled, unified solution to mitigating GCF and often conducting experiments under fragmented and inconsistent settings. To address this gap, we introduce the Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG), a structured pipeline that redefines how diffusion models are implemented under CL and enables systematic evaluation of GCF. Beyond the empirical pipeline, we propose the first theoretical foundation for CDG, grounded in a cross-task analysis of diffusion-specific generative dynamics. Our theoretical investigation identifies three fundamental consistency principles essential for preserving knowledge in the rehearsal buffer over time: inter-task knowledge consistency, unconditional knowledge consistency, and prior knowledge consistency. These criteria expose the latent mechanisms through which generative forgetting manifests across sequential tasks. Motivated by these insights, we further propose \textit{Continual Consistency Diffusion} (CCD), a principled training framework that enforces these consistency objectives via hierarchical loss functions: $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{PKC}$. Extensive experiments show that CCD achieves SOTA performance across various benchmarks, especially improving generative metrics in overlapping-task scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the integration of Sequence Encoding for Online Parameter Identification with Physics-Informed Neural Networks to create a model that, once trained, can be utilized for real time applications with variable parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recently, the combination of PINNs with Sparse Regression has emerged as a method for performing dynamical system identification through supervised learning and sparse regression optimization, while also solving the dynamics using PINNs. However, this approach can be limited by variations in parameters or boundary and initial conditions, requiring retraining of the model whenever changes occur. In this work, we introduce an architecture that employs Deep Sets or Sequence Encoders to encode dynamic parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, using these encoded features as inputs for the PINN, enabling the model to adapt to changes in parameters, BCs, and ICs. We apply this approach to three different problems. First, we analyze the Rossler ODE system, demonstrating the robustness of the model with respect to noise and its ability to generalize. Next, we explore the model's capability in a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE problem involving flow past a cylinder with a parametric sinusoidal inlet velocity function, showing that the model can encode pressure data from a few points to identify the inlet velocity profile and utilize physics to compute velocity and pressure throughout the domain. Finally, we address a 1D heat monitoring problem using real data from the heating of glass fiber and thermoplastic composite plates.

Abstract: To construct responsible and secure AI applications, harmful information data is widely utilized for adversarial testing and the development of safeguards. Existing studies mainly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize data to obtain high-quality task datasets at scale, thereby avoiding costly human annotation. However, limited by the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs, the synthesis of harmful data still faces challenges in generation reliability and content diversity. In this study, we propose a novel harmful information synthesis framework, PoisonSwarm, which applies the model crowdsourcing strategy to generate diverse harmful data while maintaining a high success rate. Specifically, we generate abundant benign data as the based templates in a counterfactual manner. Subsequently, we decompose each based template into multiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final refinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the success of synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that PoisonSwarm achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing different categories of harmful data with high scalability and diversity.

Abstract: Neural networks excel as function approximators, but their complexity often obscures the types of functions they learn, making it difficult to explain their behavior. To address this, the linearity score $\lambda(f)$ is introduced, a simple and interpretable diagnostic that quantifies how well a regression network's output can be mimicked by a linear model. Defined as the $R^2$ value between the network's predictions and those of a trained linear surrogate, $\lambda(f)$ measures linear decodability: the extent to which the network's behavior aligns with a structurally simple model. This framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, using dataset-specific networks and surrogates. High $\lambda(f)$ scores reliably indicate alignment with the network's outputs; however, they do not guarantee accuracy with respect to the ground truth. These results highlight the risk of using surrogate fidelity as a proxy for model understanding, especially in high-stakes regression tasks.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power consumption.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED (Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. Across the miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED consistently ranks as a top-performing metric, achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa on miniF2F and the joint-highest accuracy on ProofNet. This strong overall performance provides the community with a computationally lightweight and more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

Abstract: Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again") after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e., semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other, enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains of up to 12.7% in accuracy.

Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods (100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds, we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.

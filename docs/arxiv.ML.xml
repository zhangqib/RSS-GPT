Summary: 
This paper introduces RENT, a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning method that utilizes entropy minimization as an intrinsic reward, eliminating the need for external reward signals. By reinforcing high-confidence answers generated by the model, RENT improves reasoning ability across various reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated on models of different sizes from the Qwen, Mistral, and Llama families. RENT's generalizability makes it applicable to domains where external supervision is lacking, showcasing its potential to advance reinforcement learning in fields where reward engineering is challenging. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems. However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen, Mistral, and Llama families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision is unavailable.

Summary:
This study explores the challenges faced by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in complex reasoning tasks and investigates the impact of Reinforcement Learning (RL) on their performance. The authors propose a novel approach called Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) to address issues such as overthinking and performance drops. By utilizing Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) for positive samples and Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) for negative samples, the model achieves improved training stability, concise reasoning, and enhanced explorative capacity. The application of these techniques to Qwen2.5-VL-3B results in View-R1-3B, which significantly enhances reasoning capabilities without sacrificing general task performance. The model outperforms larger MLLMs on various reasoning benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed approach for advancing complex reasoning in MLLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky. Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples, Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at https://github.com/Indolent-Kawhi/View-R1.

<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a Q-learning algorithm for solving risk-averse total-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) without requiring full access to transition probabilities. The algorithm is designed to compute the optimal stationary policy for objectives such as the entropic risk measure (ERM) and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The approach leverages ERM's dynamic consistency and elicitability to achieve optimality. Numerical experiments in tabular domains show that the proposed Q-learning algorithm converges quickly and reliably to the optimal risk-averse value function. Overall, the algorithm offers a promising framework for modeling and solving undiscounted infinite-horizon objectives in MDPs with risk-averse preferences. <div>

Abstract: Risk-averse total-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a promising framework for modeling and solving undiscounted infinite-horizon objectives. Existing model-based algorithms for risk measures like the entropic risk measure (ERM) and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) are effective in small problems, but require full access to transition probabilities. We propose a Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal stationary policy for total-reward ERM and EVaR objectives with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The algorithm and its optimality are made possible by ERM's dynamic consistency and elicitability. Our numerical results on tabular domains demonstrate quick and reliable convergence of the proposed Q-learning algorithm to the optimal risk-averse value function.

Summary:
This study investigates the relationship between the number of clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points in density-based clustering methods. They find this relationship to be nearly unimodal, offering a new insight into parameter control for these methods. Utilizing the Ternary Search algorithm, the researchers devise efficient strategies for determining the radius, particularly beneficial for large-scale high-dimensional datasets where parameter tuning can be computationally intensive.

Abstract: Density-based clustering methods often surpass centroid-based counterparts, when addressing data with noise or arbitrary data distributions common in real-world problems. In this study, we reveal a key property intrinsic to density-based clustering methods regarding the relation between the number of clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points - we empirically show that it is nearly unimodal, and support this claim theoretically in a specific setting. We leverage this property to devise new strategies for finding appropriate values for the radius more efficiently based on the Ternary Search algorithm. This is especially important for large scale data that is high-dimensional, where parameter tuning is computationally intensive. We validate our methodology through extensive applications across a range of high-dimensional, large-scale NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness. This work not only offers a significant advancement in parameter control for density-based clustering but also broadens the understanding regarding the relations between their guiding parameters.

<div> Keywords: continuous normalizing flows, diffusion models, transformer-based architecture, latent variable modeling, image generation

Summary:
In this study, a novel approach is proposed to improve the efficiency of sampling in continuous normalizing flows and diffusion models by dynamically controlling the quality-complexity tradeoff. By rewiring the blocks in a transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ordinary differential equation, the sampling process can be optimized in terms of time steps and the length of the neural network. The proposed ODE_t (ODE_l) approach allows for arbitrary numbers of time steps and transformer blocks, resulting in decreased latency and memory usage compared to existing methods. Experimental results on image generation tasks demonstrate a latency reduction of up to 3 times and a FID score improvement of up to 3.5 points for high-quality sampling on datasets such as CelebA-HQ and ImageNet. The code and model weights are publicly available for reproducibility. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our $\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully reproducible experiments.

<div> Keywords: text-to-text regression, resource efficiency, Borg, encoder-decoder, uncertainty quantification

Summary:
Text-to-text regression is proposed as a scalable alternative to traditional tabular regression for predicting metric outcomes in complex systems data. In a study focused on predicting resource efficiency on Google's Borg scheduling system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder model achieved near perfect rank correlation and significantly lower mean squared error compared to tabular approaches. The model demonstrated the ability to adapt to new tasks with few-shot examples and accurately capture complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies emphasized the importance of using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's ability for uncertainty quantification. These findings suggest the potential for universal simulators of real-world outcomes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However, such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization, achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal simulators of real-world outcomes.

Summary:
The article introduces Federated Item Response Theory (IRT), a framework that combines traditional IRT models with federated learning techniques to estimate latent abilities and item difficulty in a distributed and privacy-protecting manner. The proposed FedIRT framework allows for accurate estimation of IRT models without centralizing all individual response data, offering privacy protection and reduced communication costs. Numerical experiments show that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy similar to standard IRT estimation methods. The framework is validated using a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in educational contexts. FedIRT extends the applicability of IRT to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments, without compromising accuracy or security. An open-source R package, FedIRT, is provided to facilitate practical adoption and implementation of the framework. <div>

Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) models have been widely used to estimate respondents' latent abilities and calibrate items' difficulty. Traditional IRT estimation requires all individual raw response data to be centralized in one place, thus potentially causing privacy issues. Federated learning is an emerging field in computer science and machine learning with added features of privacy protection and distributed computing. To integrate the advances from federated learning with modern psychometrics, we propose a novel framework, Federated Item Response Theory (IRT), to enable estimating traditional IRT models with additional privacy, allowing estimation in a distributed manner without losing estimation accuracy.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy similar to standard IRT estimation using popular R packages, while offering critical advantages: privacy protection and reduced communication costs. We also validate FedIRT's utility through a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic educational contexts. This new framework extends IRT's applicability to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments, without sacrificing accuracy or security. To support practical adoption, we provide an open-ource R package, FedIRT, implementing the framework for the two-parameter logistic (2PL) and partial credit models (PCM).

Summary:
Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are function approximations that use linguistic IF-THEN rules, offering transparency and universality. However, designing NFNs efficiently has been a challenge as existing methods often separate parameter and structural identification, leading to suboptimal architectures. A new approach, gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation, concurrently optimizes NFNs' parameters and structure, enabling previously inaccessible settings like online reinforcement learning for vision-based tasks. Empirical evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, showcasing NFNs trained through online reinforcement learning to excel at playing challenging scenarios in the video game DOOM. This innovative method allows for more efficient and powerful optimization of NFNs, enhancing their performance in various applications.

Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs' parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a vision-based video game called DOOM.

Summary:
Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO) introduces a novel approach to address the challenges of sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in multi-task domains. The framework integrates an implicit world model that predicts task outcomes without observation reconstruction and employs a hybrid exploration strategy combining model-based planning and model-free uncertainty bonuses. By leveraging discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates, M3PO guides exploration effectively while ensuring stable policy updates through a trust-region optimizer. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off present in prior methods and provides a robust alternative to existing model-based policy optimization approaches. M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness in addressing key issues in reinforcement learning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO), a scalable model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework designed to address sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in multi-task domains. Existing model-based approaches like DreamerV3 rely on pixel-level generative models that neglect control-centric representations, while model-free methods such as PPO suffer from high sample complexity and weak exploration. M3PO integrates an implicit world model, trained to predict task outcomes without observation reconstruction, with a hybrid exploration strategy that combines model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven bonuses. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods by using discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates to guide exploration, while maintaining stable policy updates through a trust-region optimizer. M3PO provides an efficient and robust alternative to existing model-based policy optimization approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Summary:
Graph foundation models using graph neural networks show promise in sustainable and efficient atomistic modeling. Recent studies have utilized multi-task learning to handle multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training. This approach involves shared message passing layers processing input atomistic structures before routing them to multiple decoding heads for data-specific output predictions.

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable, efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

Summary: 
The article introduces a theoretical framework demonstrating how discrete symbolic structures can naturally emerge from continuous neural network training dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training as Wasserstein gradient flow, the study shows that under geometric constraints such as group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two simultaneous phenomena: a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization trajectories and a progressive contraction on the degree of freedom. These potential functions encode algebraic constraints relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network transitions from high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower degree of freedom. Data scaling laws are established for realizing symbolic tasks, connecting representational capacity to group invariance. This framework provides insights for designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.<br /> <div>

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Forward-mode automatic differentiation, zero-order optimization, backpropagation, memory-efficient, model training

Summary: 
Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order optimization (ZO) have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation. However, a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants and a unified theoretical analysis have hindered their practical benefits. The theoretical analysis shows that FmAD and ZO, while reducing memory usage, incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and computation compared to BP with checkpointing. Empirical experiments on large language and vision-language models confirm that BP with checkpointing outperforms FmAD and ZO methods in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and computation efficiency at comparable memory usage. The results underscore the fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as the most effective strategy for model training in memory-constrained settings. The code is available for reference on GitHub.

Abstract: Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order (ZO) optimization have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation, especially in low-resource settings. However, their practical benefits remain unclear due to two key gaps: a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants, such as activation checkpointing, and a lack of a unified theoretical analysis. This work presents a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO methods. Our theoretical analysis shows that while FmAD, and ZO can reduce memory usage, they incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and computation compared to BP with checkpointing. These drawbacks worsen with larger models or constrained perturbation budgets. Empirical experiments on large language and vision-language models show that BP with checkpointing outperforms FmAD and ZO variants, including those enhanced with variance reduction, achieving up to 31.1% higher accuracy, 34.8% faster convergence, and 3.8x fewer computations at comparable memory usage. Our results highlight fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO, and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as the most effective strategy for model training under memory-constrained settings.

This work explores the impact of partial observation in stochastic systems using the Koopman operator theory. It highlights the significance of distinguishing between the state space and function space in stochastic systems. The delay embedding technique proves beneficial for partial observation even in stochastic systems. Numerical experiments reveal a power-law accuracy behavior for the additive noise amplitude, with the exponent of the power-law behavior indicating the effects of partial observation.

Abstract: It is sometimes difficult to achieve a complete observation for a full set of observables, and partial observations are necessary. For deterministic systems, the Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a theoretical framework for handling partial observations. Recently, data-driven algorithms based on the Koopman operator theory have made significant progress, and there is a discussion to connect the Mori-Zwanzig formalism with the Koopman operator theory. In this work, we discuss the effects of partial observation in stochastic systems using the Koopman operator theory. The discussion clarifies the importance of distinguishing the state space and the function space in stochastic systems. Even in stochastic systems, the delay embedding technique is beneficial for partial observation, and several numerical experiments showed a power-law behavior of the accuracy for the amplitude of the additive noise. We also discuss the relation between the exponent of the power-law behavior and the effects of partial observation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an important machine learning paradigm for solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in this field due to the rapid development of deep neural networks. However, the success of RL currently relies on extensive training data and computational resources. In addition, RL's limited ability to generalize across tasks restricts its applicability in dynamic and real-world environments. With the arisen of Continual Learning (CL), Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) has emerged as a promising research direction to address these limitations by enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to new tasks, and retain previously acquired knowledge. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive examination of CRL, focusing on its core concepts, challenges, and methodologies. Firstly, we conduct a detailed review of existing works, organizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario settings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them into four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer. Finally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides practical insights into future directions.

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks demands a fundamental shift from bit-centric transmission to semantic-aware communication that emphasizes task-relevant information. This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises, providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance across all tested scenarios.

Summary: 
GuiderNet is a meta-learning framework designed to address challenges faced by Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as barren plateaus and poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. By conditioning Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) using data-dependent parameter shifts to minimize the log condition number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor, GuiderNet significantly improves training performance.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer potential for near-term quantum advantage but face challenges from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish, and poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. We introduce GuiderNet, a meta-learning framework that conditions Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) using data-dependent parameter shifts aimed at minimizing the log condition number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. Implemented as a classical neural network, GuiderNet is meta-trained to guide PQC parameters into geometrically favorable regions and is embedded within hybrid quantum-classical pipelines to steer both initialization and adaptive modulation during training.
  Applied to the Kaggle Diabetes classification task, GuiderNet reduces cumulative training loss by over 5x, improves test accuracy from 75.3% to 98.6%, and increases the minority-class F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. It also suppresses gradient explosion and stabilizes parameter updates, enabling smoother and more robust optimization. These results demonstrate that geometric meta-conditioning can mitigate barren plateaus and ill-conditioning, providing a scalable approach to enhance trainability and generalization in quantum machine learning.

Summary: 
The proposed physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm does not require real-world events data for training. It generates DAS events data by modeling target events and constraints of the real world and DAS system, then utilizes a generative network to train a DAS debackground net that removes background noise in DAS data. This approach achieved comparable or better performance in event identification and belt conveyor fault monitoring applications, even without labeled real-world data for training. The paradigm's introduction of physical information and noise removal capability allows for generalization across different sites within the same application. In a belt conveyor fault diagnosis scenario, a fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% was achieved using networks transferred from a simulation test site without any actual fault events data from the test site and field for training. This innovative approach offers a promising solution to challenges related to data acquisition and noise in practical DAS applications, opening up new possibilities in various fields for DAS technology.

Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising. Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore more potential fields for DAS.

Summary:
- In the realm of online advertising, advertisers use ad auctions and auto-bidding tools to secure advertising slots.
- The Decision Transformer (DT) is applied to automate bidding systems and capture long-term dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior.
- Challenges of conventional DT include the need for a preset return-to-go (RTG) value and the restriction of the learned policy by mixed-quality training data.
- The R* Decision Transformer (R* DT) is introduced to address these challenges through a three-step process: R DT, R^ DT, and R* DT.
- R* DT improves the RTG of trajectories in the training data and guides the suboptimal policy towards optimality, as validated by comprehensive tests on a publicly available bidding dataset.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless, conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data, which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges, we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT, we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator) to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.

Summary:
SceneDiffuser++ is introduced as a novel approach for city-scale traffic simulation in autonomous vehicle testing. The goal is to generate synthetic miles to augment real-world testing. CitySim envisions a generative simulated city where an AV can navigate from point A to point B seamlessly. SceneDiffuser++ integrates scene generation, agent behavior modeling, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation, and environment simulation in a single model. It is the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function for point-to-point simulation. The model is demonstrated on a larger scale map using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, showcasing superior realism in long simulation scenarios. This advancement addresses the need for comprehensive simulation technologies to enhance AV testing and validation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to support trip-level simulation.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new probabilistic semiparametric model that utilizes data binning to reduce computational costs in kernel density estimation for nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional probability distributions, sparse binned kernel density estimation and Fourier kernel density estimation, are proposed for binned semiparametric Bayesian networks. These distributions address the curse of dimensionality by using sparse tensors and limiting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability calculations. Through complexity analysis and comparative experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets, the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks demonstrate structural learning and log-likelihood estimations comparable to non-binned models but with significantly faster processing times. The results indicate that these binned models are a dependable and more efficient alternative to their non-binned counterparts. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

Summary:
The paper presents a graph-aware state space model for time series data over graphs, focusing on applications like urban water networks and networked neuroscience. The model incorporates both the latent state and observation equation as parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters. The state equation follows a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graph edges, allowing for flexibility in modeling uncertainties and increasing degrees of freedom. The observation model captures multi-hop neighboring influence by sampling and graph-filtering the state. Parameters in both the state and observation models are learned from partially observed data for tasks like prediction and imputation. The model is initially inferred using maximum likelihood but is later improved through a deep learning architecture that jointly learns parameters and tracks the state, akin to Kalman neural networks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in applications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked neuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.

Summary: 
TROFI is a new approach for offline reinforcement learning that learns a reward function from human preferences to label the training dataset, enabling policy learning without a pre-defined reward function. Experimental results on D4RL benchmark and a 3D game environment demonstrate TROFI's superior performance over baselines and comparable results to using ground truth reward. The study emphasizes the importance of a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function for aligning the value function to actual future rewards. TROFI's innovative method of using human preferences for reward function learning showcases its effectiveness in scenarios where reward functions are not readily available. <div>
arXiv:2506.22008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video game development, the availability of the reward function is not always guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies. Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment. Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements, multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized, lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness, semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

Summary: 

Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown success in forecasting tasks but are limited by their focus on real-valued series. The proposed Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA) framework aims to bridge this gap by handling diverse covariates in forecasting, including categorical variables and multimodal data. UniCA first standardizes heterogeneous covariates into homogeneous representations and then integrates them using an attention-based fusion mechanism. This approach is adaptable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, enhancing TSFM's generalization ability while incorporating additional covariate information. Experimental results on various forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of UniCA in real-world scenarios, showing the potential of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation. The code for UniCA is available on GitHub for further exploration and application. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios. Codes are released on https://github.com/hanlu-nju/UniCA.

Summary: 
The article introduces Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS) as a technique to improve the performance of Large Language Models using the Pre-LayerNorm Transformer architecture. The Pre-LN architecture suffers from activation variance issues that limit the learning capacity of deeper layers. GPAS addresses this problem by scaling down intermediate activations while preserving gradients, preventing information loss and avoiding gradient vanishing. Experiments conducted across different model sizes demonstrate that GPAS consistently enhances model performance. The technique shows promise not only for Pre-LN Transformers but also for alternative architectures like Sandwich-LN and DeepNorm, indicating its versatility in improving training dynamics across various settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

While being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers, causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training dynamics in a wide range of settings.

Summary: The article discusses the connections between Transformers and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning on graphs. It examines how Transformers can be seen as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens. The self-attention mechanism in Transformers captures the relative importance of tokens to each other, while positional encodings provide information about sequential ordering or structure. Transformers are described as expressive set processing networks that can learn relationships among input elements without predefined graphs. Despite their similarities to GNNs, Transformers are implemented using dense matrix operations, making them more hardware-efficient than sparse message passing. The perspective is offered that Transformers are GNNs currently benefiting from efficient hardware utilization. <div>

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing networks that learn relationships among input elements without being constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs, Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware lottery.

Summary:
Neural networks are utilized in this study to tackle multi-objective routing on multigraphs, a concept that has not received much attention despite its practical importance. Two neural approaches are introduced in the research: one that works directly on the multigraph by selecting edges sequentially to complete a tour, and another that simplifies the multigraph into a simple graph before building routes. Experimental validation shows that both models exhibit strong performance in solving problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This study highlights the potential of neural networks in optimizing routing decisions on complex multigraph structures, demonstrating their effectiveness in addressing practical routing challenges. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. However, the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Summary:
Using deep learning, a new model has been developed to simplify the assessment of heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports. The traditional method of assessing pollution involves laborious procedures and data analysis of sediment samples. This new approach tackles data scarcity issues in the water-sediment domain by leveraging transfer learning to predict Pollution Load Index (PLI). The model was tested using data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia, resulting in significantly lower Mean Absolute Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error compared to other models.

Abstract: Detecting heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports is vital for regional environmental monitoring. The Pollution Load Index (PLI), an international standard, is commonly used to assess heavy metal containment. However, the conventional PLI assessment involves laborious procedures and data analysis of sediment samples. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-learning-based model that simplifies the heavy metal assessment process. Our model tackles the issue of data scarcity in the water-sediment domain, which is traditionally plagued by challenges in data collection and varying standards across nations. By leveraging transfer learning, we develop an accurate quantitative assessment method for predicting PLI. Our approach allows the transfer of learned features across domains with different sets of features. We evaluate our model using data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia: Port Yamba, Port Newcastle, Port Jackson, Port Botany, Port Kembla, and Port Eden. The results demonstrate significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately 0.5 and 0.03, respectively, compared to other models. Our model performance is up to 2 orders of magnitude than other baseline models. Our proposed model offers an innovative, accessible, and cost-effective approach to predicting water quality, benefiting marine life conservation, aquaculture, and industrial pollution monitoring.

Abstract: In the aftermath of major earthquakes, evaluating structural and infrastructural damage is vital for coordinating post-disaster response efforts. This includes assessing damage's extent and spatial distribution to prioritize rescue operations and resource allocation. Accurately estimating damage grades to buildings post-earthquake is paramount for effective response and recovery, given the significant impact on lives and properties, underscoring the urgency of streamlining relief fund allocation processes. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of multi-class classification, especially XGBoost, along with other machine learning models and ensembling methods, incorporating regularization to address class imbalance. One consequence of class imbalance is that it may give rise to skewed models that undervalue minority classes and give preference to the majority class. This research deals with the problem of class imbalance with the help of the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We delve into multiple multi-class classification machine learning, deep learning models, and ensembling methods to forecast structural damage grades. The study elucidates performance determinants through comprehensive feature manipulation experiments and diverse training approaches. It identifies key factors contributing to seismic vulnerability while evaluating model performance using techniques like the confusion matrix further to enhance understanding of the effectiveness of earthquake damage prediction.

The article introduces a parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This method allows for the design of control laws without constraints on system structure or controller form. A Thompson sampling framework is proposed for exploring optimal control laws, with theoretical guarantees on convergence and control regret.

Numerical experiments on unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness of the method. <div>
arXiv:2506.22186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective method to explore parametric uncertainties and can therefore be used for active learning-based controller design. However, TS relies on finite parametric representations, which limits its applicability to more general spaces, which are more commonly encountered in control system design. To address this issue, this work pro poses a parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and designs a data-driven active learning control approach. Specifically, the proposed method treats the control law as an element in a function space, allowing the design of control laws without imposing restrictions on the system structure or the form of the controller. A TS framework is proposed in this work to explore potential optimal control laws, and the convergence guarantees are further provided for the learning process. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method learns the relationship between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential rate, and the upper bound of control regret is also derived. Numerical experiments on controlling unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems show promise in accelerating drug discovery. This study examines the interchangeability of LLM-based agentic system components for drug discovery, including the performance of different LLMs and tool-calling versus code-generating agents. LLMs such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o outperform others like Llama-3.1-8B and GPT-3.5-Turbo in orchestrating chemistry tools. While code-generating agents generally outperform tool-calling agents, the effectiveness varies based on the question and model used. Additionally, replacing system prompts impacts performance, emphasizing the importance of prompt re-engineering. Further research into agentic system modularity is necessary for stable and scalable solutions in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery applications. We compare the performance of different large language models (LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types, tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts storage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance. These advancements enhance diverse ML applications, including distributed and federated learning, and tinyML on resource-constrained edge devices, unlocking new possibilities for efficient and scalable learning.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for storing structured information. Consequently, predictive tasks leveraging this data format hold significant application promise. Recently, Relational Deep Learning (RDL) has emerged as a novel paradigm wherein RDBs are conceptualized as graph structures, enabling the application of various graph neural architectures to effectively address these tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions. EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories, applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle, guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

Abstract: Decision making under uncertain environments in the maximization of expected reward while minimizing its risk is one of the ubiquitous problems in many subjects. Here, we introduce a novel problem setting in stochastic bandit optimization that jointly addresses two critical aspects of decision-making: maximizing expected reward and minimizing associated uncertainty, quantified via the mean-variance(MV) criterion. Unlike traditional bandit formulations that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy. We provide theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the returned solutions in both settings. To complement this theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations across synthetic benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and sample efficiency, highlighting its broad applicability to risk-aware decision-making tasks in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters. Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs. Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel approach to tensor decomposition that does not rely on predefined structural assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. The proposed model uses a neural network to learn an energy function and optimize it through score matching, allowing for flexibility in modeling relationships between tensors and shared factors. By integrating the block coordinate descent algorithm with smooth regularization, the model can perform tensor completion and denoising tasks effectively. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance across various types of tensors, including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data. This approach offers a more flexible and accurate method for multiway data analysis without the need for prior knowledge of the optimal rank structure or contraction rules. <div>
arXiv:2506.22295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank tensor decompositions (TDs) provide an effective framework for multiway data analysis. Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic perspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model the relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such prior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly regarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization procedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations made during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue, we propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined structural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of compatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural network is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score matching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries and shared factors. Our method allows for modeling structures and distributions beyond the Dirac delta assumption. Moreover, integrating the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm with the proposed smooth regularization enables the model to perform both tensor completion and denoising. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements across various tensor types, including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data.

Summary:
The paper introduces CoATA, a dual-channel Graph Neural Network framework designed to address the issue of noise and incompleteness in real-world graphs by jointly augmenting and refining both the topology structures and node attributes. CoATA first enriches and denoises node attributes using structural signals, then refines the attribute space by projecting it into a bipartite graph for further structure reconstruction. It employs contrastive learning with prototype alignment and consistency constraints to improve mutual corrections between the augmented and original graphs. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that CoATA surpasses eleven baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic relationship between topology and attributes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic relationship between topology and attributes.

Abstract: Domain shift is a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in medical applications where data distributions differ across institutions due to variations in data collection practices, equipment, and procedures. This can degrade performance when models trained on source domain data are applied to the target domain. Domain adaptation methods have been widely studied to address this issue, but most struggle when class proportions between the source and target domains differ. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised domain adaptation method that leverages class proportion information from the target domain, which is often accessible in medical datasets through prior knowledge or statistical reports. Our method assigns pseudo-labels to the unlabeled target data based on class proportion (called proportion-constrained pseudo-labeling), improving performance without the need for additional annotations. Experiments on two endoscopic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques, even when 5% of the target domain is labeled. Additionally, the experimental results with noisy proportion labels highlight the robustness of our method, further demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world application scenarios.

arXiv:2506.22304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form, one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative modeling.

<div> Keywords: Greedy Equivalence Search, causal discovery, Less Greedy Equivalence Search, observational data, interventional data

Summary:
Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES) is a modified version of Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) designed to improve computational efficiency and accuracy in causal discovery from observational data. By avoiding edge insertions implied by conditional independence in the scoring, LGES achieves up to a 10-fold speed-up compared to GES while reducing structural errors. LGES can incorporate prior assumptions and adjust them based on data contradictions, as well as utilize interventional data to enhance the learned equivalence class. The algorithm guarantees recovery of the true equivalence class in the sample limit, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that LGES outperforms GES and other methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and robustness to misspecified assumptions. The code for LGES is publicly available for further research and development.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at https://github.com/CausalAILab/lges.

Summary:
This paper introduces a framework that combines deep learning with epidemic models to perform epidemic forecasting and learn a mechanistic model of epidemic spread. The framework incorporates multiple datasets, including sensitive ones with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees, to enhance the accuracy of forecasting and model learning. A realistic synthetic financial dataset with DP guarantees is used in the demonstration, showing its value in epidemic analyses. The integration of diverse datasets, including those with privacy protections, enhances the effectiveness of epidemic forecasting and modeling. The framework's ability to incorporate sensitive data with DP guarantees highlights the significance of privacy protection in epidemiology and public health analyses. <div>

Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting, development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in forecasting and learning an epidemic model, even when used with DP guarantees.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, physics-informed inductive biases, symbolic approach, neuro-symbolic integration, indoor navigation

Summary: 
This study introduces a symbolic approach called physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) for enhancing reinforcement learning (RL) agents in physical control tasks. By distilling physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents using a domain-specific language (DSL), the framework aims to improve sample efficiency and generalization. The PiPRL framework integrates symbolic programming, neural perception modules, and a low-level neural controller to leverage physics priors in indoor navigation tasks. Through a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic integration, PiPRL outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies, reducing training time by over 26%. The framework addresses the challenge of incorporating physics priors in RL agents by providing a human-readable and explainable DSL that guides the RL process. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using symbolic approaches to incorporate physics priors in RL systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When using reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle physical control tasks, inductive biases that encode physics priors can help improve sample efficiency during training and enhance generalization in testing. However, the current practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning (FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities. Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att, which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

Summary: 
The article introduces a probabilistic framework for optimizing inference-time scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches lack a principled foundation for parallel sampling, resulting in inefficient reasoning performance. The proposed framework formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling based on independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) parallel samples. By deriving a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, the framework offers guidance for compute-efficient scaling. The algorithm, \textsc{OptScale}, dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses using a language model-based predictor. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that \textsc{OptScale} reduces sampling overhead while maintaining or improving reasoning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. This work provides a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for enhancing the efficient deployment of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, providing the first principled guidance for compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop \textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC) demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance. Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

Summary: 
Distributed Neural Architectures (DNAs) are introduced and trained in vision and language domains. DNAs consist of modules and routers where tokens can traverse modules in any order. They generalize sparse methods like Mixture-of-Experts and Mixture-of-Depths. During training, DNAs learn computation and communication patterns based on token content and context. These patterns can be shaped for efficiency or load balancing. Empirical results show DNAs are competitive with dense baselines and can learn compute efficiency from data. The paths tokens take through DNAs follow a distributed power-law distribution. Some paths show specialization. Models learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable manner. <div>

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts, Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse healthcare settings.

<div> optimistic regularization, exploration, exploitation, value-incentivized actor-critic, regret guarantees

Summary:
The paper introduces a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method for online reinforcement learning with complex function approximations. The method aims to balance exploration and exploitation by optimizing a single objective that encourages consistent state-action and policy estimates while maximizing value functions. Through the lens of primal-dual optimization, the principle of optimism is interpreted to provide a fresh perspective on exploration strategies. The VAC method is shown to have near-optimal regret guarantees in linear Markov decision processes for both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings. These guarantees can be extended to the general function approximation setting under suitable assumptions. The proposed method addresses the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning with complex function approximations, providing a practical and theoretically sound approach supported by regret guarantees.

arXiv:2506.22401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) with complex function approximations such as transformers and deep neural networks plays a significant role in the modern practice of artificial intelligence. Despite its popularity and importance, balancing the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation remains a long-standing challenge; in particular, we are still in lack of efficient and practical schemes that are backed by theoretical performance guarantees. Motivated by recent developments in exploration via optimistic regularization, this paper provides an interpretation of the principle of optimism through the lens of primal-dual optimization. From this fresh perspective, we set forth a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method, which optimizes a single easy-to-optimize objective integrating exploration and exploitation -- it promotes state-action and policy estimates that are both consistent with collected data transitions and result in higher value functions. Theoretically, the proposed VAC method has near-optimal regret guarantees under linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings, which can be extended to the general function approximation setting under appropriate assumptions.

arXiv:2506.22423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception, navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations), an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the need for iterative adversarial training.

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings, and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and unsupervised PFL tasks.

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM) for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68 points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile, several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea. Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense, understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage, we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/MMLU-CF.

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly, various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection. Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training.

<title>Bench to the Future: A Pastcasting Benchmark for Forecasting Agents</title>

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts" on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own research.

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models (LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

<title>The Saturation Point of Backtranslation in High Quality Low Resource English Gujarati Machine Translation</title>

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000 sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites. BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of 5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama, and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level, real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition, the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78. BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will be made available via the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/amirap80/BioPars.

<title>Random Initialization Can't Catch Up: The Advantage of Language Model Transfer for Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21570</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language models to time series forecasting under various design choices including upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions leveraged by these models.

<title>Instruction Learning Paradigms: A Dual Perspective on White-box and Black-box LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21573</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

<title>Evaluating the Robustness of Dense Retrievers in Interdisciplinary Domains</title>

Abstract: Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity, boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures, the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a 3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple topics.

arXiv:2506.21585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes, such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions, evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%, $-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

<title>Representation Consistency for Accurate and Coherent LLM Answer Aggregation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21590</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%) over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent reasoning.

<title>Reinforcement Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Next POI Recommendation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models. Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.
  To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.

Abstract: This paper explores the human-centric operationalization of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems, addressing aspects beyond accuracy. We compare various machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches, identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability, considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle with explainability, whereas LLMs provide richer explanations. We also found that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and trustworthy AES methods.

Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for multimodal generative AI struggle to establish trustworthiness, hindering enterprise adoption where reliability is paramount. We introduce a systematic, quantitative benchmarking framework to measure the trustworthiness of progressively integrating cross-modal inputs such as text, images, captions, and OCR within VisualRAG systems for enterprise document intelligence. Our approach establishes quantitative relationships between technical metrics and user-centric trust measures. Evaluation reveals that optimal modality weighting with weights of 30% text, 15% image, 25% caption, and 30% OCR improves performance by 57.3% over text-only baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide comparative assessments of foundation models, demonstrating their differential impact on trustworthiness in caption generation and OCR extraction-a vital consideration for reliable enterprise AI. This work advances responsible AI deployment by providing a rigorous framework for quantifying and enhancing trustworthiness in multimodal RAG for critical enterprise applications.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze. Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations, and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG, a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential, structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced text classification by enabling automated understanding and categorization of complex, unstructured textual data. However, accurately capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and contextual variations inherent in natural language, particularly within consumer complaints, remains a challenge. This study addresses these issues by incorporating human-experience-trained algorithms that effectively recognize subtle semantic differences crucial for assessing consumer relief eligibility. Furthermore, we propose integrating synthetic data generation methods that utilize expert evaluations of generative adversarial networks and are refined through expert annotations. By combining expert-trained classifiers with high-quality synthetic data, our research seeks to significantly enhance machine learning classifier performance, reduce dataset acquisition costs, and improve overall evaluation metrics and robustness in text classification tasks.

Abstract: The Deep and Cross architecture (DCNv2) is a robust production baseline and is integral to numerous real-life recommender systems. Its inherent efficiency and ability to model interactions often result in models that are both simpler and highly competitive compared to more computationally demanding alternatives, such as Deep FFMs. In this work, we introduce three significant algorithmic improvements to the DCNv2 architecture, detailing their formulation and behavior at scale. The enhanced architecture we refer to as DCN^2 is actively used in a live recommender system, processing over 0.5 billion predictions per second across diverse use cases where it out-performed DCNv2, both offline and online (ab tests). These improvements effectively address key limitations observed in the DCNv2, including information loss in Cross layers, implicit management of collisions through learnable lookup-level weights, and explicit modeling of pairwise similarities with a custom layer that emulates FFMs' behavior. The superior performance of DCN^2 is also demonstrated on four publicly available benchmark data sets.

Abstract: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including 128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements -- collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to support future research in trail-based off-road navigation.

Abstract: Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However, unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation, routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement. Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance zero-shot LLM performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance. Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint. Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimeter systems.

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling, especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.

Abstract: Authors Yi-Cheng Chen, Ping-En Lu, Cheng-Shang Chang, and Tzu-Hsuan Liu use the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) linear system filtering method to track and predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19, in a pandemic context in which there was still no vaccine and the only way to avoid contagion was isolation. To estimate the coefficients of these FIR filters, Chen et al. used machine learning methods through a classical optimization problem with regularization (ridge regression). These estimated coefficients are called ridge coefficients. The epidemic mathematical model adopted by these researchers to formulate the FIR filters is the time-dependent discrete SIR. In this paper, we propose a small modification to the algorithm of Chen et al. to obtain the ridge coefficients. We then used this modified algorithm to track and predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19 in the state of Minas Gerais/Brazil, within a prediction window, during the initial period of the pandemic. We also compare the predicted data with the respective real data to check how good the approximation is. In the modified algorithm, we set values for the FIR filter orders and for the regularization parameters, both different from the respective values defined by Chen et al. in their algorithm. In this context, the numerical results obtained by the modified algorithm in some simulations present better approximation errors compared to the respective approximation errors presented by the algorithm of Chen et al.

The proposed line of work generalizes Higher-Order Langevin Dynamics (HOLD), a recent state-of-the-art diffusion method, by introducing the concept of critical damping from systems analysis.

Abstract: Storm surge forecasting plays a crucial role in coastal disaster preparedness, yet existing machine learning approaches often suffer from limited spatial resolution, reliance on coastal station data, and poor generalization. Moreover, many prior models operate directly on unstructured spatial data, making them incompatible with modern deep learning architectures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that projects unstructured water elevation fields onto structured Red Green Blue (RGB)-encoded image representations, enabling the application of Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) networks for end-to-end spatiotemporal surge forecasting. Our model further integrates ground-truth wind fields as dynamic conditioning signals and topo-bathymetry as a static input, capturing physically meaningful drivers of surge evolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of synthetic storms in the Gulf of Mexico, our method demonstrates robust 48-hour forecasting performance across multiple regions along the Texas coast and exhibits strong spatial extensibility to other coastal areas. By combining structured representation, physically grounded forcings, and scalable deep learning, this study advances the frontier of storm surge forecasting in usability, adaptability, and interpretability.

<title>Inverse Design of Diffractive Metasurfaces Using Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator, we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating high-fidelity images but typically suffer from inefficient sampling. Many solver designs and noise scheduling strategies have been proposed to dramatically improve sampling speeds. In this paper, we introduce a new sampling method that is up to $186\%$ faster than the current state of the art solver for comparative FID on ImageNet512. This new sampling method is training-free and uses an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. The key to our method resides in using higher-dimensional initial noise, allowing to produce more detailed samples with less function evaluations from existing pretrained diffusion models. In addition, by design our solver allows to control the level of detail through a simple hyper-parameter at no extra computational cost. We present how our approach leverages momentum dynamics by establishing a fundamental equivalence between momentum diffusion models and conventional diffusion models with respect to their training paradigms. Moreover, we observe the use of higher-dimensional noise naturally exhibits characteristics similar to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Finally, we demonstrate strong performances on a set of representative pretrained diffusion models, including EDM, EDM2, and Stable-Diffusion 3, which cover models in both pixel and latent spaces, as well as class and text conditional settings.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA, and RIM-ONE datasets to enhance generalization. Our experiments show that minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical utility.

Abstract: Recent research works establish deep neural networks as high performing tools for radar target detection, especially on challenging environments (presence of clutter or interferences, multi-target scenarii...). However, the usually large computational complexity of these networks is one of the factors preventing them from being widely implemented in embedded radar systems. We propose to investigate novel neural architecture search (NAS) methods, based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), for finding neural networks achieving the required detection performance and striving towards a lower computational complexity. We evaluate the searched architectures on endoclutter radar signals, in order to compare their respective performance metrics and generalization properties. A novel network satisfying the required detection probability while being significantly lighter than the expert-designed baseline is proposed.

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats, comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

<title>Classification with Reject Option: Distribution-free Error Guarantees via Conformal Prediction</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models always make a prediction, even when they are likely to be wrong. This causes problems in practical applications, as we do not know if we should trust a prediction. ML with reject option addresses this issue by abstaining from making a prediction if it is likely to be incorrect. In this work, we formalise the approach to ML with reject option in binary classification, deriving theoretical guarantees on the resulting error rate. This is achieved through conformal prediction (CP), which produce prediction sets with distribution-free validity guarantees. In binary classification, CP can output prediction sets containing exactly one, two or no labels. By accepting only the singleton predictions, we turn CP into a binary classifier with reject option.
  Here, CP is formally put in the framework of predicting with reject option. We state and prove the resulting error rate, and give finite sample estimates. Numerical examples provide illustrations of derived error rate through several different conformal prediction settings, ranging from full conformal prediction to offline batch inductive conformal prediction. The former has a direct link to sharp validity guarantees, whereas the latter is more fuzzy in terms of validity guarantees but can be used in practice. Error-reject curves illustrate the trade-off between error rate and reject rate, and can serve to aid a user to set an acceptable error rate or reject rate in practice.

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP, a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token, beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/MELP.

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph (CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model, CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a widely recognized additive manufacturing technology for producing intricate metal components with exceptional accuracy. A key challenge in L-PBF is the formation of complex microstructures affecting product quality. We propose a physics-guided, machine-learning approach to optimize scan paths for desired microstructure outcomes, such as equiaxed grains. We utilized a phase-field method (PFM) to model crystalline grain structure evolution. To reduce computational costs, we trained a surrogate machine learning model, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network, using single-track phase-field simulations with various laser powers to predict crystalline grain orientations based on initial microstructure and thermal history. We investigated three scanning strategies across various hatch spacings within a square domain, achieving a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup using the surrogate model. To reduce trial and error in designing laser scan toolpaths, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate optimized scan paths for target microstructure. Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL approach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our DRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The reward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted microstructure from the agent's scan path. The reinforcement learning algorithm was benchmarked against conventional zigzag approach for smaller and larger domains, showing machine learning methods' potential to enhance microstructure control and computational efficiency in L-PBF optimization.

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving +5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20% in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3% for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- & 5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations, advancing automated processing and analysis in the field. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/RafaelSterzinger/few-shot-map-segmentation.

Abstract: Fetal sleep is a relatively underexplored yet vital aspect of prenatal neurodevelopment. Understanding fetal sleep patterns could provide insights into early brain maturation and help clinicians detect signs of neurological compromise that arise due to fetal hypoxia or fetal growth restriction. This review synthesizes over eight decades of research on the physiological characteristics, ontogeny, and regulation of fetal sleep. We compare sleep-state patterns in humans and large animal models, highlighting species-specific differences and the presence of sleep-state analogs. We review both invasive techniques in animals and non-invasive modalities in humans. Computational methods for sleep-state classification are also examined, including rule-based approaches (with and without clustering-based preprocessing) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Finally, we discuss how intrauterine conditions such as hypoxia and fetal growth restriction can disrupt fetal sleep. This review provides a comprehensive foundation for the development of objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring technologies to support early diagnosis and intervention in prenatal care.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical machine learning, primarily to solve classification, regression and generative tasks. However, its rapid development raises critical security challenges in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This chapter examines adversarial threats unique to QML systems, focusing on vulnerabilities in cloud-based deployments, hybrid architectures, and quantum generative models. Key attack vectors include model stealing via transpilation or output extraction, data poisoning through quantum-specific perturbations, reverse engineering of proprietary variational quantum circuits, and backdoor attacks. Adversaries exploit noise-prone quantum hardware and insufficiently secured QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) workflows to compromise model integrity, ownership, and functionality. Defense mechanisms leverage quantum properties to counter these threats. Noise signatures from training hardware act as non-invasive watermarks, while hardware-aware obfuscation techniques and ensemble strategies disrupt cloning attempts. Emerging solutions also adapt classical adversarial training and differential privacy to quantum settings, addressing vulnerabilities in quantum neural networks and generative architectures. However, securing QML requires addressing open challenges such as balancing noise levels for reliability and security, mitigating cross-platform attacks, and developing quantum-classical trust frameworks. This chapter summarizes recent advances in attacks and defenses, offering a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to build robust, trustworthy QML systems resilient to evolving adversarial landscapes.

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis. We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL), highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation. These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&amp;E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods. Project page: https://www.factral.co/UnMix-NeRF.

<title>Interactive Multi-Objective Probabilistic Preference Learning with Soft and Hard Bounds</title>

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component, T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence, enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more effective DMs.

<title>Thompson Sampling in Function Spaces via Neural Operators</title>

Abstract: We propose an extension of Thompson sampling to optimization problems over function spaces where the objective is a known functional of an unknown operator's output. We assume that functional evaluations are inexpensive, while queries to the operator (such as running a high-fidelity simulator) are costly. Our algorithm employs a sample-then-optimize approach using neural operator surrogates. This strategy avoids explicit uncertainty quantification by treating trained neural operators as approximate samples from a Gaussian process. We provide novel theoretical convergence guarantees, based on Gaussian processes in the infinite-dimensional setting, under minimal assumptions. We benchmark our method against existing baselines on functional optimization tasks involving partial differential equations and other nonlinear operator-driven phenomena, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and competitive performance.

<title>Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Low-Altitude MEC via Graph Attention Diffusion</title>

Abstract: With the rapid development of the low-altitude economy, air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems are facing increasing demands for real-time and intelligent task scheduling. In such systems, task offloading and resource allocation encounter multiple challenges, including node heterogeneity, unstable communication links, and dynamic task variations. To address these issues, this paper constructs a three-layer heterogeneous MEC system architecture for low-altitude economic networks, encompassing aerial and ground users as well as edge servers. The system is systematically modeled from the perspectives of communication channels, computational costs, and constraint conditions, and the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions and resource allocation is uniformly abstracted into a graph-structured modeling task. On this basis, we propose a graph attention diffusion-based solution generator (GADSG). This method integrates the contextual awareness of graph attention networks with the solution distribution learning capability of diffusion models, enabling joint modeling and optimization of discrete offloading variables and continuous resource allocation variables within a high-dimensional latent space. We construct multiple simulation datasets with varying scales and topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GADSG model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of optimization performance, robustness, and generalization across task structures, showing strong potential for efficient task scheduling in dynamic and complex low-altitude economic network environments.

Abstract: Hitchhiking, a spontaneous and decentralized mode of travel, has long eluded systematic study due to its informal nature. This paper presents and analyzes the largest known structured dataset of hitchhiking rides, comprising over 63,000 entries collected over nearly two decades through platforms associated with hitchwiki.org and lately on hitchmap.com. By leveraging crowd-sourced contributions, the dataset captures key spatiotemporal and strategic aspects of hitchhiking. This work documents the dataset's origins, evolution, and community-driven maintenance, highlighting its Europe-centric distribution, seasonal patterns, and reliance on a small number of highly active contributors. Through exploratory analyses, I examine waiting times, user behavior, and comment metadata, shedding light on the lived realities of hitchhikers. While the dataset has inherent biases and limitations - such as demographic skew and unverifiable entries it offers a rare and valuable window into an alternative form of mobility. I conclude by outlining future directions for enriching the dataset and advancing research on hitchhiking as both a transportation practice and cultural phenomenon.

<title>More Vulnerable than You Think: On the Stability of Tool-Integrated LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for future LLM development and evaluation.

<title>Advancing Jailbreak Strategies: A Hybrid Approach to Exploiting LLM Vulnerabilities and Bypassing Modern Defenses</title>

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications. Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks. Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's 58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85 minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance, utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the proposed normalization scheme).

<title>Tied Prototype Model for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes. However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model (TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features. Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or "circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g. "Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

<title>Visual Structures Helps Visual Reasoning: Addressing the Binding Problem in VLMs</title>

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Abstract: The transport industry has recently shown significant interest in unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), specifically for port and inland waterway transport. These systems can improve operational efficiency and safety, which is especially relevant in the European Union, where initiatives such as the Green Deal are driving a shift towards increased use of inland waterways. At the same time, a shortage of qualified personnel is accelerating the adoption of autonomous solutions. However, there is a notable lack of open-source, high-fidelity simulation frameworks and datasets for developing and evaluating such solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce AirSim For Surface Vehicles (ASVSim), an open-source simulation framework specifically designed for autonomous shipping research in inland and port environments. The framework combines simulated vessel dynamics with marine sensor simulation capabilities, including radar and camera systems and supports the generation of synthetic datasets for training computer vision models and reinforcement learning agents. Built upon Cosys-AirSim, ASVSim provides a comprehensive platform for developing autonomous navigation algorithms and generating synthetic datasets. The simulator supports research of both traditional control methods and deep learning-based approaches. Through limited experiments, we demonstrate the potential of the simulator in these research areas. ASVSim is provided as an open-source project under the MIT license, making autonomous navigation research accessible to a larger part of the ocean engineering community.

Abstract: Physics phenomena are often described by ordinary and/or partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs), and solved analytically or numerically. Unfortunately, many real-world systems are described only approximately with missing or unknown terms in the equations. This makes the distribution of the physics model differ from the true data-generating process (DGP). Using limited and unpaired data between DGP observations and the imperfect model simulations, we investigate this particular setting by completing the known-physics model, combining theory-driven models and data-driven to describe the shifted distribution involved in the DGP. We present a novel hybrid generative model approach combining deep grey-box modelling with Optimal Transport (OT) methods to enhance incomplete physics models. Our method implements OT maps in data space while maintaining minimal source distribution distortion, demonstrating superior performance in resolving the unpaired problem and ensuring correct usage of physics parameters. Unlike black-box alternatives, our approach leverages physics-based inductive biases to accurately learn system dynamics while preserving interpretability through its domain knowledge foundation. Experimental results validate our method's effectiveness in both generation tasks and model transparency, offering detailed insights into learned physics dynamics.

Abstract: Single-cell sequencing is revolutionizing biology by enabling detailed investigations of cell-state transitions. Many biological processes unfold along continuous trajectories, yet it remains challenging to extract smooth, low-dimensional representations from inherently noisy, high-dimensional single-cell data. Neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms, such as t-SNE and UMAP, are widely used to embed high-dimensional single-cell data into low dimensions. But they often introduce undesirable distortions, resulting in misleading interpretations. Existing evaluation methods for NE algorithms primarily focus on separating discrete cell types rather than capturing continuous cell-state transitions, while dynamic modeling approaches rely on strong assumptions about cellular processes and specialized data. To address these challenges, we build on the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for reliable and reproducible data-driven discoveries. First, we systematically evaluate popular NE algorithms through empirical analysis, simulation, and theory, and reveal their key shortcomings, such as artifacts and instability. We then introduce NESS, a principled and interpretable machine learning approach to improve NE representations by leveraging algorithmic stability and to enable robust inference of smooth biological structures. NESS offers useful concepts, quantitative stability metrics, and efficient computational workflows to uncover developmental trajectories and cell-state transitions in single-cell data. Finally, we apply NESS to six single-cell datasets, spanning pluripotent stem cell differentiation, organoid development, and multiple tissue-specific lineage trajectories. Across these diverse contexts, NESS consistently yields useful biological insights, such as identification of transitional and stable cell states and quantification of transcriptional dynamics during development.

Abstract: The integration of the history and philosophy of statistics was initiated at least by Hacking (1965) and advanced by Mayo (1996), but it has not received sustained follow-up. Yet such integration is more urgent than ever, as the recent success of artificial intelligence has been driven largely by machine learning -- a field historically developed alongside statistics. Today, the boundary between statistics and machine learning is increasingly blurred. What we now need is integration, twice over: of history and philosophy, and of the field they engage -- statistics and machine learning. I present a case study of a philosophical idea in machine learning (and in formal epistemology) whose root can be traced back to an often under-appreciated insight in Neyman and Pearson's 1936 work (a follow-up to their 1933 classic). This leads to the articulation of a foundational assumption -- largely implicit in, but shared by, the practices of frequentist statistics and machine learning -- which I call achievabilism. Another integration also emerges at the level of methodology, combining two ends of the philosophy of science spectrum: history and philosophy of science on the one hand, and formal epistemology on the other hand.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5 accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for a low parameter cost.

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution. In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Abstract: We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words, quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems. Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion $GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

<title>Optimal Estimation of Watermark Proportions in Hybrid AI-Human Texts</title>

Abstract: Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important tool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from LLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether entire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source texts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we address the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in mixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter in a mixture model based on \emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this parameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone consistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ continuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion parameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient estimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased watermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable estimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve these lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source text generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed estimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes, unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

Abstract: Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation, where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning (SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate. In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second, DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality loss.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time. Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an autonomous research agent.

<title>Beyond ReLU: How Activations Affect Neural Kernels and Random Wide Networks</title>

Abstract: While the theory of deep learning has made some progress in recent years, much of it is limited to the ReLU activation function. In particular, while the neural tangent kernel (NTK) and neural network Gaussian process kernel (NNGP) have given theoreticians tractable limiting cases of fully connected neural networks, their properties for most activation functions except for powers of the ReLU function are poorly understood. Our main contribution is to provide a more general characterization of the RKHS of these kernels for typical activation functions whose only non-smoothness is at zero, such as SELU, ELU, or LeakyReLU. Our analysis also covers a broad set of special cases such as missing biases, two-layer networks, or polynomial activations. Our results show that a broad class of not infinitely smooth activations generate equivalent RKHSs at different network depths, while polynomial activations generate non-equivalent RKHSs. Finally, we derive results for the smoothness of NNGP sample paths, characterizing the smoothness of infinitely wide neural networks at initialization.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research on deep interpretable neural networks with decision trees as one of the most commonly incorporated tools. There are at least three advantages of using decision trees over logistic regression classification models: they are easy to interpret since they are based on binary decisions, they can make decisions faster, and they provide a hierarchy of classes. However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision trees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the decision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep learning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov processes, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision graphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG). We provide an extensive theoretical study of SONG, complemented by experiments conducted on Letter, Connect4, MNIST, CIFAR, and TinyImageNet datasets, showing that our method performs on par or better than existing decision models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for identifying test samples that deviate from in-distribution (ID) data, ensuring network robustness and reliability. This paper presents a flexible framework for OOD knowledge distillation that extracts OOD-sensitive information from a network to develop a binary classifier capable of distinguishing between ID and OOD samples in both scenarios, with and without access to training ID data. To accomplish this, we introduce Confidence Amendment (CA), an innovative methodology that transforms an OOD sample into an ID one while progressively amending prediction confidence derived from the network to enhance OOD sensitivity. This approach enables the simultaneous synthesis of both ID and OOD samples, each accompanied by an adjusted prediction confidence, thereby facilitating the training of a binary classifier sensitive to OOD. Theoretical analysis provides bounds on the generalization error of the binary classifier, demonstrating the pivotal role of confidence amendment in enhancing OOD sensitivity. Extensive experiments spanning various datasets and network architectures confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in detecting OOD samples.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for learning from decentralized data in privacy-constrained scenarios.However, system and statistical challenges hinder its real-world applicability, requiring efficient learning from edge devices and robustness to data heterogeneity. Despite significant research efforts, existing approaches often degrade severely due to the joint effect of heterogeneity and partial client participation. In particular, while momentum appears as a promising approach for overcoming statistical heterogeneity, in current approaches its update is biased towards the most recently sampled clients. As we show in this work, this is the reason why it fails to outperform FedAvg, preventing its effective use in real-world large-scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel Generalized Heavy-Ball Momentum (GHBM) and theoretically prove it enables convergence under unbounded data heterogeneity in cyclic partial participation, thereby advancing the understanding of momentum's effectiveness in FL. We then introduce adaptive and communication-efficient variants of GHBM that match the communication complexity of FedAvg in settings where clients can be stateful. Extensive experiments on vision and language tasks confirm our theoretical findings, demonstrating that GHBM substantially improves state-of-the-art performance under random uniform client sampling, particularly in large-scale settings with high data heterogeneity and low client participation.

Abstract: The estimation of probability density functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. However, common methods such as kernel density estimation (KDE) have been demonstrated to lack robustness, while more complex methods have not been evaluated in multi-modal estimation problems. In this paper, we present ROME (RObust Multi-modal Estimator), a non-parametric approach for density estimation which addresses the challenge of estimating multi-modal, non-normal, and highly correlated distributions. ROME utilizes clustering to segment a multi-modal set of samples into multiple uni-modal ones and then combines simple KDE estimates obtained for individual clusters in a single multi-modal estimate. We compared our approach to state-of-the-art methods for density estimation as well as ablations of ROME, showing that it not only outperforms established methods but is also more robust to a variety of distributions. Our results demonstrate that ROME can overcome the issues of over-fitting and over-smoothing exhibited by other estimators.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning aims to capture the underlying structure of potentially large and high-dimensional datasets. Traditionally, this involves using dimensionality reduction (DR) methods to project data onto lower-dimensional spaces or organizing points into meaningful clusters (clustering). In this work, we revisit these approaches under the lens of optimal transport and exhibit relationships with the Gromov-Wasserstein problem. This unveils a new general framework, called distributional reduction, that recovers DR and clustering as special cases and allows addressing them jointly within a single optimization problem. We empirically demonstrate its relevance to the identification of low-dimensional prototypes representing data at different scales, across multiple image and genomic datasets.

Abstract: The message-passing mechanism underlying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is not naturally suited for heterophilic datasets, where adjacent nodes often have different labels. Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification. The code and appendix are available at https://github.com/difra100/Link_Prediction_with_PIGNN_IJCNN.

Abstract: Linearization of attention using various kernel approximation and kernel learning techniques has shown promise. Past methods used a subset of combinations of component functions and weight matrices within the random feature paradigm. We identify the need for a systematic comparison of different combinations of weight matrices and component functions for attention learning in Transformer. Hence, we introduce Spectraformer, a unified framework for approximating and learning the kernel function in the attention mechanism of the Transformer. Our empirical results demonstrate, for the first time, that a random feature-based approach can achieve performance comparable to top-performing sparse and low-rank methods on the challenging Long Range Arena benchmark. Thus, we establish a new state-of-the-art for random feature-based efficient Transformers. The framework also produces many variants that offer different advantages in accuracy, training time, and memory consumption.

Abstract: Among various aspects of ensuring the responsible design of AI tools for healthcare applications, addressing fairness concerns has been a key focus area. Specifically, given the wide spread of electronic health record (EHR) data and their huge potential to inform a wide range of clinical decision support tasks, improving fairness in this category of health AI tools is of key importance. While such a broad problem (mitigating fairness in EHR-based AI models) has been tackled using various methods, task- and model-agnostic methods are noticeably rare. In this study, we aimed to target this gap by presenting a new pipeline that generates synthetic EHR data, which is not only consistent with (faithful to) the real EHR data but also can reduce the fairness concerns (defined by the end-user) in the downstream tasks, when combined with the real data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline across various downstream tasks and two different EHR datasets. Our proposed pipeline can add a widely applicable and complementary tool to the existing toolbox of methods to address fairness in health AI applications, such as those modifying the design of a downstream model.

Abstract: Many social programs attempt to allocate scarce resources to people with the greatest need. Indeed, public services increasingly use algorithmic risk assessments motivated by this goal. However, targeting the highest-need recipients often conflicts with attempting to evaluate the causal effect of the program as a whole, as the best evaluations would be obtained by randomizing the allocation. We propose a framework to design randomized allocation rules which optimally balance targeting high-need individuals with learning treatment effects, presenting policymakers with a Pareto frontier between the two goals. We give sample complexity guarantees for the policy learning problem and provide a computationally efficient strategy to implement it. We then collaborate with the human services department of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania to evaluate our methods on data from real service delivery settings. Optimized policies can substantially mitigate the tradeoff between learning and targeting. For example, it is often possible to obtain 90% of the optimal utility in targeting high-need individuals while ensuring that the average treatment effect can be estimated with less than 2 times the samples that a randomized controlled trial would require. Mechanisms for targeting public services often focus on measuring need as accurately as possible. However, our results suggest that algorithmic systems in public services can be most impactful if they incorporate program evaluation as an explicit goal alongside targeting.

Abstract: In this paper, the causal bandit problem is investigated, with the objective of maximizing the long-term reward by selecting an optimal sequence of interventions on nodes in an unknown causal graph. It is assumed that both the causal topology and the distribution of interventions are unknown. First, based on the difference between the two types of graph identification errors (false positives and negatives), a causal graph learning method is proposed. Numerical results suggest that this method has a much lower sample complexity relative to the prior art by learning sub-graphs. However, we note that a sample complexity analysis for the new algorithm has not been undertaken, as of yet. Under the assumption of minimum-mean squared error weight estimation, a new uncertainty bound tailored to the causal bandit problem is derived. This uncertainty bound drives an upper confidence bound-based intervention selection to optimize the reward. Further, we consider a particular instance of non-stationary bandits wherein both the causal topology and interventional distributions can change. Our solution is the design of a sub-graph change detection mechanism that requires a modest number of samples. Numerical results compare the new methodology to existing schemes and show a substantial performance improvement in stationary and non-stationary settings. Averaged over 100 randomly generated causal bandits, the proposed scheme takes significantly fewer samples to learn the causal structure and achieves a reward gain of 85% compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model. We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation, showing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the distillation length.

Abstract: Testing a hypothesized causal model against observational data is a key prerequisite for many causal inference tasks. A natural approach is to test whether the conditional independence relations (CIs) assumed in the model hold in the data. While a model can assume exponentially many CIs (with respect to the number of variables), testing all of them is both impractical and unnecessary. Causal graphs, which encode these CIs in polynomial space, give rise to local Markov properties that enable model testing with a significantly smaller subset of CIs. Model testing based on local properties requires an algorithm to list the relevant CIs. However, existing algorithms for realistic settings with hidden variables and non-parametric distributions can take exponential time to produce even a single CI constraint. In this paper, we introduce the c-component local Markov property (C-LMP) for causal graphs with hidden variables. Since C-LMP can still invoke an exponential number of CIs, we develop a polynomial delay algorithm to list these CIs in poly-time intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that enables poly-delay testing of CIs in causal graphs with hidden variables against arbitrary data distributions. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is challenging for data-driven methods, as these models must adapt to variations in parameters such as coefficients, forcing terms, and initial conditions. State-of-the-art neural surrogates perform adaptation through gradient-based optimization and meta-learning to implicitly encode the variety of dynamics from observations. This often comes with increased inference complexity. Inspired by the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we introduce Zebra, a novel generative auto-regressive transformer designed to solve parametric PDEs without requiring gradient adaptation at inference. By leveraging in-context information during both pre-training and inference, Zebra dynamically adapts to new tasks by conditioning on input sequences that incorporate context example trajectories. As a generative model, Zebra can be used to generate new trajectories and allows quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions. We evaluate Zebra across a variety of challenging PDE scenarios, demonstrating its adaptability, robustness, and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Generalization (DG) is preventing overfitting to source domains, which can be mitigated by finding flatter minima in the loss landscape. In this work, we propose Quantization-aware Training for Domain Generalization (QT-DoG) and demonstrate that weight quantization effectively leads to flatter minima in the loss landscape, thereby enhancing domain generalization. Unlike traditional quantization methods focused on model compression, QT-DoG exploits quantization as an implicit regularizer by inducing noise in model weights, guiding the optimization process toward flatter minima that are less sensitive to perturbations and overfitting. We provide both an analytical perspective and empirical evidence demonstrating that quantization inherently encourages flatter minima, leading to better generalization across domains. Moreover, with the benefit of reducing the model size through quantization, we demonstrate that an ensemble of multiple quantized models further yields superior accuracy than the state-of-the-art DG approaches with no computational or memory overheads. Code is released at: https://saqibjaved1.github.io/QT_DoG/.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a crucial step in improving the responsiveness of pretrained large language models (LLMs) to human instructions. Federated learning (FL) helps to exploit the use of vast private instruction data from clients, becoming popular for LLM tuning by improving data diversity. Existing federated tuning simply consumes all local data, causing excessive computational overhead and overfitting to local data, while centralized data-efficient solutions are not suitable for FL due to privacy concerns. This work presents FedHDS, a federated data-efficient instruction tuning approach, which tunes LLMs with a representative subset of edge-side data. It reduces the data redundancy at both intra- and inter-client levels without sharing raw data. Experiments with various LLMs, datasets and partitions show that FedHDS improves Rouge-L on unseen tasks by an average of 10.72% over the SOTA full-data federated instruction tuning methods, while using less than 1.5% of the data samples, improving training efficiency by up to tens of times.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our systems in which the objective is to determine whether a given news article could be considered as hyperpartisan. Hyperpartisan news is news that takes an extremely polarized political standpoint with an intention of creating political divide among the public. We attempted several approaches, including n-grams, sentiment analysis, as well as sentence and document representation using pre-tained ELMo. Our best system using pre-trained ELMo with Bidirectional LSTM achieved an accuracy of 83% through 10-fold cross-validation without much hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, i.e., network traffic from cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into prior and residual components, with the prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain. We provide code and data at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/NPDiff.

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are stochastic process models used to characterize event sequences occurring in continuous time. Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement, offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.

Abstract: We focus on reducing communication overhead in multiplayer games, where frequently exchanging strategies between players is not feasible and players have noisy or outdated strategies of the other players. We introduce Decoupled SGDA, a novel adaptation of Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (SGDA). In this approach, players independently update their strategies based on outdated opponent strategies, with periodic synchronization to align strategies. For Strongly-Convex-Strongly-Concave (SCSC) games, we demonstrate that Decoupled SGDA achieves near-optimal communication complexity comparable to the best-known GDA rates. For weakly coupled games where the interaction between players is lower relative to the non-interactive part of the game, Decoupled SGDA significantly reduces communication costs compared to standard SGDA. Our findings extend to multi-player games. To provide insights into the effect of communication frequency and convergence, we extensively study the convergence of Decoupled SGDA for quadratic minimax problems. Lastly, in settings where the noise over the players is imbalanced, Decoupled SGDA significantly outperforms federated minimax methods.

Abstract: Existing literature lacks a graph domain adaptation technique for handling large distribution shifts, primarily due to the difficulty in simulating an evolving path from source to target graph. To make a breakthrough, we present a graph gradual domain adaptation (GGDA) framework with the construction of a compact domain sequence that minimizes information loss in adaptations. Our approach starts with an efficient generation of knowledge-preserving intermediate graphs over the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric. With the bridging data pool, GGDA domains are then constructed via a novel vertex-based domain progression, which comprises "close" vertex selections and adaptive domain advancement to enhance inter-domain information transferability. Theoretically, our framework concretizes the intractable inter-domain distance $W_p(\mu_t,\mu_{t+1})$ via implementable upper and lower bounds, enabling flexible adjustments of this metric for optimizing domain formation. Extensive experiments under various transfer scenarios validate the superior performance of our GGDA framework.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown promising results for several domains such as materials science, chemistry, and the social sciences. GNN models often contain millions of parameters, and like other neural network (NN) models, are often fed only a fraction of the graphs that make up the training dataset in batches to update model parameters. The effect of batching algorithms on training time and model performance has been thoroughly explored for NNs but not yet for GNNs. We analyze two different batching algorithms for graph based models, namely static and dynamic batching for two datasets, the QM9 dataset of small molecules and the AFLOW materials database. Our experiments show that changing the batching algorithm can provide up to a 2.7x speedup, but the fastest algorithm depends on the data, model, batch size, hardware, and number of training steps run. Experiments show that for a select number of combinations of batch size, dataset, and model, significant differences in model learning metrics are observed between static and dynamic batching algorithms.

Abstract: It is difficult to anticipate the myriad challenges that a predictive model will encounter once deployed. Common practice entails a reactive, cyclical approach: model deployment, data mining, and retraining. We instead develop a proactive longtail discovery process by imagining additional data during training. In particular, we develop general model-based longtail signals, including a differentiable, single forward pass formulation of epistemic uncertainty that does not impact model parameters or predictive performance but can flag rare or hard inputs. We leverage these signals as guidance to generate additional training data from a latent diffusion model in a process we call Longtail Guidance (LTG). Crucially, we can perform LTG without retraining the diffusion model or the predictive model, and we do not need to expose the predictive model to intermediate diffusion states. Data generated by LTG exhibit semantically meaningful variation, yield significant generalization improvements on numerous image classification benchmarks, and can be analyzed by a VLM to proactively discover, textually explain, and address conceptual gaps in a deployed predictive model.

Abstract: Novel materials drive progress across applications from energy storage to electronics. Automated characterization of material structures with machine learning methods offers a promising strategy for accelerating this key step in material design. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive language model that performs crystal structure prediction (CSP) from powder diffraction data. The presented model, deCIFer, generates crystal structures in the widely used Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format and can be conditioned on powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. Unlike earlier works that primarily rely on high-level descriptors like composition, deCIFer is also able to use diffraction data to perform CSP. We train deCIFer on nearly 2.3M crystal structures and validate on diverse sets of PXRD patterns for characterizing challenging inorganic crystal systems. Qualitative checks and quantitative assessments using the residual weighted profile show that deCIFer produces structures that more accurately match the target diffraction data. Notably, deCIFer can achieve a 94% match rate on test data. deCIFer bridges experimental diffraction data with computational CSP, lending itself as a powerful tool for crystal structure characterization.

Abstract: Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- graph structure and node features --, we introduce Rings, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods from a distinct angle. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for dataset evaluation via extensive experiments on graph-level tasks and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have proven effective at enhancing mathematical reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging increased inference-time computation. However, they are predominantly trained on mathematical data and their generalizability to non-mathematical domains has not been rigorously studied. In response, this work first shows that current PRMs have poor performance in other domains. To address this limitation, we introduce VersaPRM, a multi-domain PRM trained on synthetic reasoning data generated using our novel data generation and annotation method. VersaPRM achieves consistent performance gains across diverse domains. For instance, in the MMLU-Pro category of Law, VersaPRM via weighted majority voting, achieves a 7.9% performance gain over the majority voting baseline -- surpassing Qwen2.5-Math-PRM's gain of 1.3%. We further contribute to the community by open-sourcing all data, code and models for VersaPRM.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics. Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching 100 million, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a novel divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a computer-aided design geometry alone, omitting the need for costly CFD meshing procedures.

Abstract: We address the problem of code generation from multi-turn execution feedback. Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose a simple yet scalable approach, $\mu$Code, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. $\mu$Code iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines. We provide analysis of the design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of $\mu$Code at utilizing the execution feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/portal-cornell/muCode.

Abstract: Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.

Abstract: We consider a good arm identification problem in a stochastic bandit setting with multi-objectives, where each arm $i \in [K]$ is associated with a distribution $D_i$ defined over $R^M$. For each round $t$, the player pulls an arm $i_t$ and receives an $M$-dimensional reward vector sampled according to $D_{i_t}$. The goal is to find, with high probability, an $\epsilon$-good arm whose expected reward vector is larger than $\bm{\xi} - \epsilon \mathbf{1}$, where $\bm{\xi}$ is a predefined threshold vector, and the vector comparison is component-wise. We propose the Multi-Thresholding UCB~(MultiTUCB) algorithm with a sample complexity bound. Our bound matches the existing one in the special case where $M=1$ and $\epsilon=0$. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline approaches across synthetic and real datasets.

Evaluated on a realistic vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, the proposed method achieves 61.01% top-1 accuracy and 97.39% top-3 accuracy in standard prediction tasks, significantly outperforming traditional deep learning models. In few-shot prediction scenarios, the performance degradation is limited to 12.56% (top-1) and 5.55% (top-3) from time sample 1 to 10, demonstrating superior prediction capability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive success across various tasks. Integrating LLMs with Federated Learning (FL), a paradigm known as FedLLM, offers a promising avenue for collaborative model adaptation while preserving data privacy. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive review of FedLLM. We begin by tracing the historical development of both LLMs and FL, summarizing relevant prior research to set the context. Subsequently, we delve into an in-depth analysis of the fundamental challenges inherent in deploying FedLLM. Addressing these challenges often requires efficient adaptation strategies; therefore, we conduct an extensive examination of existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and explore their applicability within the FL framework. To rigorously evaluate the performance of FedLLM, we undertake a thorough review of existing fine-tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. Furthermore, we discuss FedLLM's diverse real-world applications across multiple domains. Finally, we identify critical open challenges and outline promising research directions to foster future advancements in FedLLM. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, offering valuable insights into the rapidly evolving landscape of federated fine-tuning for LLMs. It also establishes a roadmap for future innovations in privacy-preserving AI.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and differential equations (DEs) are two rapidly advancing areas of research that have shown remarkable synergy in recent years. GNNs have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, while differential equations provide a principled framework for modeling continuous dynamics across time and space. The intersection of these fields has led to innovative approaches that leverage the strengths of both, enabling applications in physics-informed learning, spatiotemporal modeling, and scientific computing.

Abstract: In graph signal processing, learning the weighted connections between nodes from a set of sample signals is a fundamental task when the underlying relationships are not known a priori. This task is typically addressed by finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs. However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations, subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our approach, designated as Hypergraph Structure Learning with Smoothness (HSLS), addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.

<title>Causal Inference Isn't Special: Why It's Just Another Prediction Problem</title>

Abstract: Causal inference is often portrayed as fundamentally distinct from predictive modeling, with its own terminology, goals, and intellectual challenges. But at its core, causal inference is simply a structured instance of prediction under distribution shift. In both cases, we begin with labeled data from a source domain and seek to generalize to a target domain where outcomes are not observed. The key difference is that in causal inference, the labels -- potential outcomes -- are selectively observed based on treatment assignment, introducing bias that must be addressed through assumptions. This perspective reframes causal estimation as a familiar generalization problem and highlights how techniques from predictive modeling, such as reweighting and domain adaptation, apply directly to causal tasks. It also clarifies that causal assumptions are not uniquely strong -- they are simply more explicit. By viewing causal inference through the lens of prediction, we demystify its logic, connect it to familiar tools, and make it more accessible to practitioners and educators alike.

<title>Graph-Reward-SQL: Execution-Free Reinforcement Learning for Text-to-SQL via Graph Matching and Stepwise Reward</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Text-to-SQL tasks. However, existing methods often rely on execution-based or LLM-based Bradley-Terry reward models. The former suffers from high execution latency caused by repeated database calls, whereas the latter imposes substantial GPU memory overhead, both of which significantly hinder the efficiency and scalability of RL pipelines. To this end, we propose a novel Text-to-SQL RL fine-tuning framework named Graph-Reward-SQL, which employs the GMNScore outcome reward model. We leverage SQL graph representations to provide accurate reward signals while significantly reducing inference time and GPU memory usage. Building on this foundation, we further introduce StepRTM, a stepwise reward model that provides intermediate supervision over Common Table Expression (CTE) subqueries. This encourages both functional correctness and structural clarity of SQL. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on standard benchmarks, including Spider and BIRD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing reward models.

Abstract: Competing risks are crucial considerations in survival modelling, particularly in healthcare domains where patients may experience multiple distinct event types. We propose CRISP-NAM (Competing Risks Interpretable Survival Prediction with Neural Additive Models), an interpretable neural additive model for competing risks survival analysis which extends the neural additive architecture to model cause-specific hazards while preserving feature-level interpretability. Each feature contributes independently to risk estimation through dedicated neural networks, allowing for visualization of complex non-linear relationships between covariates and each competing risk. We demonstrate competitive performance on multiple datasets compared to existing approaches.

<title>On the Lipschitz Continuity of Set Aggregation Functions and Neural Networks for Sets</title>

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant of a neural network is connected to several important properties of the network such as its robustness and generalization. It is thus useful in many settings to estimate the Lipschitz constant of a model. Prior work has focused mainly on estimating the Lipschitz constant of multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Here we focus on data modeled as sets or multisets of vectors and on neural networks that can handle such data. These models typically apply some permutation invariant aggregation function, such as the sum, mean or max operator, to the input multisets to produce a single vector for each input sample. In this paper, we investigate whether these aggregation functions are Lipschitz continuous with respect to three distance functions for unordered multisets, and we compute their Lipschitz constants. In the general case, we find that each aggregation function is Lipschitz continuous with respect to only one of the three distance functions. Then, we build on these results to derive upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks that can process multisets of vectors, while we also study their stability to perturbations and generalization under distribution shifts. To empirically verify our theoretical analysis, we conduct a series of experiments on datasets from different domains.

Abstract: As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general technique that allows an agent to learn an optimal policy and interact with an environment in sequential decision making problems. The goodness of a policy is measured by its value function starting from some initial state. The focus of this paper is to construct confidence intervals (CIs) for a policy's value in infinite horizon settings where the number of decision points diverges to infinity. We propose to model the action-value state function (Q-function) associated with a policy based on series/sieve method to derive its confidence interval. When the target policy depends on the observed data as well, we propose a SequentiAl Value Evaluation (SAVE) method to recursively update the estimated policy and its value estimator. As long as either the number of trajectories or the number of decision points diverges to infinity, we show that the proposed CI achieves nominal coverage even in cases where the optimal policy is not unique. Simulation studies are conducted to back up our theoretical findings. We apply the proposed method to a dataset from mobile health studies and find that reinforcement learning algorithms could help improve patient's health status. A Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at https://github.com/shengzhang37/SAVE.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel generative AI (GAI)-driven, unified semi-supervised learning architecture for optimizing resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. Termed Generative Semi-Supervised VAE-Contrastive Learning, our approach maximizes the weighted user equipment (UE) throughput and allocates physical resource blocks (PRBs) to enhance the quality of service for eMBB and URLLC services. The GAI framework utilizes a dedicated xApp for intelligent power control and PRB allocation. This integrated GAI model synergistically combines the generative power of a VAE with contrastive learning to achieve robustness in an end-to-end trainable system. It is a semi-supervised training approach that concurrently optimizes supervised regression of resource allocation decisions (i.e., power, UE association, PRB) and unsupervised contrastive objectives. This intrinsic fusion improves the precision of resource management and model generalization in dynamic mobile networks. We evaluated our GAI methodology against exhaustive search and deep Q-Network algorithms using key performance metrics. Results show our integrated GAI approach offers superior efficiency and effectiveness in various scenarios, presenting a compelling GAI-based solution for critical network slicing and resource management challenges in next-generation O-RAN systems.

<title>RLSF: Fine-tuning LLMs via Symbolic Feedback</title>

arXiv:2405.16661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed AI but often struggle with tasks that require domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment. Traditional fine-tuning methods do not leverage the vast amount of symbolic domain-knowledge available to us via symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., provers), and are further limited by sparse rewards and unreliable reward models.
  We introduce Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), a novel fine-tuning paradigm where symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., solvers, provers, and algebra systems) provide fine-grained feedback to LLMs. RLSF uses poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs) generated by symbolic tools to identify and correct errors in model outputs, offering token-level guidance without requiring differentiable reasoning systems. This paradigm bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and LLM fine-tuning, enabling precise alignment with domain-specific constraints while addressing key limitations of traditional reward signals.
  Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs outperforms traditional approaches on five different applications (that have some associated logical or domain constraints), namely, program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language, three chemistry tasks, and solving the Game of 24. A key takeaway is that fine-tuning via RLSF enables relatively smaller LLMs to significantly outperform closed-source models that are orders of magnitude larger.

<title>CAPM: Fast and Robust Verification on Maxpool-based CNN via Dual Network</title>

Abstract: This study uses CAPM (Convex Adversarial Polytope for Maxpool-based CNN) to improve the verified bound for general purpose maxpool-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under bounded norm adversarial perturbations. The maxpool function is decomposed as a series of ReLU functions to extend the convex relaxation technique to maxpool functions, by which the verified bound can be efficiently computed through a dual network. The experimental results demonstrate that this technique allows the state-of-the-art verification precision for maxpool-based CNNs and involves a much lower computational cost than current verification methods, such as DeepZ, DeepPoly and PRIMA. This method is also applicable to large-scale CNNs, which previous studies show to be often computationally prohibitively expensive. Under certain circumstances, CAPM is 40-times, 20-times or twice as fast and give a significantly higher verification bound (CAPM 98% vs. PRIMA 76%/DeepPoly 73%/DeepZ 8%) as compared to PRIMA/DeepPoly/DeepZ. Furthermore, we additionally present the time complexity of our algorithm as $O(W^2NK)$, where $W$ is the maximum width of the neural network, $N$ is the number of neurons, and $K$ is the size of the maxpool layer's kernel.

How this emerges from the collective action of nonlinearity, noise, learning rate, and other factors, has eluded first-principles theories built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. We exhibit a noise-nonlinearity phase diagram that identifies regimes where shallow or deep layers learn more effectively and propose a macroscopic mechanical theory that reproduces the diagram and links feature learning across layers to generalization.

<title>Mitigating Metropolitan Carbon Emissions with Dynamic Eco-driving at Scale</title>

Abstract: The sheer scale and diversity of transportation make it a formidable sector to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety, and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50% of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly, this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution strategies.

Abstract: We examine stability properties of primal-dual gradient flow dynamics for composite convex optimization problems with multiple, possibly nonsmooth, terms in the objective function under the generalized consensus constraint. The proposed dynamics are based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian and they provide a viable alternative to ADMM which faces significant challenges from both analysis and implementation viewpoints in large-scale multi-block scenarios. In contrast to customized algorithms with individualized convergence guarantees, we develop a systematic approach for solving a broad class of challenging composite optimization problems. We leverage various structural properties to establish global (exponential) convergence guarantees for the proposed dynamics. Our assumptions are much weaker than those required to prove (exponential) stability of primal-dual dynamics as well as (linear) convergence of discrete-time methods such as standard two-block and multi-block ADMM and EXTRA algorithms. Finally, we show necessity of some of our structural assumptions for exponential stability and provide computational experiments to demonstrate the convenience of the proposed approach for parallel and distributed computing applications.

Abstract: Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) provides finite-sample coverage guarantees, enhancing the prediction reliability under non-exchangeability. This study demonstrates that these desirable properties of ACI do not require the use of Conformal Predictors (CP). We show that the guarantees hold for the broader class of confidence predictors, defined by the requirement of producing nested prediction sets, a property we argue is essential for meaningful confidence statements. We empirically investigate the performance of Non-Conformal Confidence Predictors (NCCP) against CP when used with ACI on non-exchangeable data. In online settings, the NCCP offers significant computational advantages while maintaining a comparable predictive efficiency. In batch settings, inductive NCCP (INCCP) can outperform inductive CP (ICP) by utilising the full training dataset without requiring a separate calibration set, leading to improved efficiency, particularly when the data are limited. Although these initial results highlight NCCP as a theoretically sound and practically effective alternative to CP for uncertainty quantification with ACI in non-exchangeable scenarios, further empirical studies are warranted across diverse datasets and predictors.

Abstract: We study continued training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a language model (LM) to make effective use of long-context information. We first establish a reliable evaluation protocol to guide model development -- instead of perplexity or simple needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) tests, we use a broad set of long-context downstream tasks, and we evaluate models after SFT as this better reveals long-context abilities. Supported by our robust evaluations, we run thorough experiments to decide the data mix for continued pre-training, the instruction tuning dataset, and many other design choices such as position extrapolation. We find that (1) code repositories and books are excellent sources of long data, but it is crucial to combine them with high-quality short-context data; (2) training with a sequence length beyond the evaluation length boosts long-context performance; (3) for SFT, using only short instruction datasets yields strong performance on long-context tasks. Our final model, ProLong-8B, which is initialized from Llama-3 and trained on 40B tokens, demonstrates state-of-the-art long-context performance among similarly sized models at a length of 128K. ProLong outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the majority of long-context tasks despite using only 5% as many tokens during long-context training. Additionally, ProLong can effectively process up to 512K tokens, one of the longest context windows of publicly available LMs.

Abstract: Driving progress of AI models and agents requires comparing their performance on standardized benchmarks; for general agents, individual performances must be aggregated across a potentially wide variety of different tasks. In this paper, we describe a novel ranking scheme inspired by social choice frameworks, called Soft Condorcet Optimization (SCO), to compute the optimal ranking of agents: the one that makes the fewest mistakes in predicting the agent comparisons in the evaluation data. This optimal ranking is the maximum likelihood estimate when evaluation data (which we view as votes) are interpreted as noisy samples from a ground truth ranking, a solution to Condorcet's original voting system criteria. SCO ratings are maximal for Condorcet winners when they exist, which we show is not necessarily true for the classical rating system Elo. We propose three optimization algorithms to compute SCO ratings and evaluate their empirical performance. When serving as an approximation to the Kemeny-Young voting method, SCO rankings are on average 0 to 0.043 away from the optimal ranking in normalized Kendall-tau distance across 865 preference profiles from the PrefLib open ranking archive. In a simulated noisy tournament setting, SCO achieves accurate approximations to the ground truth ranking and the best among several baselines when 59\% or more of the preference data is missing. Finally, SCO ranking provides the best approximation to the optimal ranking, measured on held-out test sets, in a problem containing 52,958 human players across 31,049 games of the classic seven-player game of Diplomacy.

Abstract: Watermarking has offered an effective approach to distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written text. However, the pervasive presence of human edits on LLM-generated text dilutes watermark signals, thereby significantly degrading detection performance of existing methods. In this paper, by modeling human edits through mixture model detection, we introduce a new method in the form of a truncated goodness-of-fit test for detecting watermarked text under human edits, which we refer to as Tr-GoF. We prove that the Tr-GoF test achieves optimality in robust detection of the Gumbel-max watermark in a certain asymptotic regime of substantial text modifications and vanishing watermark signals. Importantly, Tr-GoF achieves this optimality \textit{adaptively} as it does not require precise knowledge of human edit levels or probabilistic specifications of the LLMs, in contrast to the optimal but impractical (Neyman--Pearson) likelihood ratio test. Moreover, we establish that the Tr-GoF test attains the highest detection efficiency rate in a certain regime of moderate text modifications. In stark contrast, we show that sum-based detection rules, as employed by existing methods, fail to achieve optimal robustness in both regimes because the additive nature of their statistics is less resilient to edit-induced noise. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive and sometimes superior empirical performance of the Tr-GoF test on both synthetic data and open-source LLMs in the OPT and LLaMA families.

Abstract: Complex networked systems driven by latent inputs are common in fields like neuroscience, finance, and engineering. A key inference problem here is to learn edge connectivity from node outputs (potentials). We focus on systems governed by steady-state linear conservation laws: $X_t = {L^{\ast}}Y_{t}$, where $X_t, Y_t \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denote inputs and potentials, respectively, and the sparsity pattern of the $p \times p$ Laplacian $L^{\ast}$ encodes the edge structure. Assuming $X_t$ to be a wide-sense stationary stochastic process with a known spectral density matrix, we learn the support of $L^{\ast}$ from temporally correlated samples of $Y_t$ via an $\ell_1$-regularized Whittle's maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The regularization is particularly useful for learning large-scale networks in the high-dimensional setting where the network size $p$ significantly exceeds the number of samples $n$.
  We show that the MLE problem is strictly convex, admitting a unique solution. Under a novel mutual incoherence condition and certain sufficient conditions on $(n, p, d)$, we show that the ML estimate recovers the sparsity pattern of $L^\ast$ with high probability, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph underlying $L^{\ast}$. We provide recovery guarantees for $L^\ast$ in element-wise maximum, Frobenius, and operator norms. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with several simulation studies on synthetic and benchmark datasets, including engineered systems (power and water networks), and real-world datasets from neural systems (such as the human brain).

Abstract: 3D models surpass 2D models in CT/MRI segmentation by effectively capturing inter-slice relationships. However, the added depth dimension substantially increases memory consumption. While patch-based training alleviates memory constraints, it significantly slows down the inference speed due to the sliding window (SW) approach. We propose No-More-Sliding-Window (NMSW), a novel end-to-end trainable framework that enhances the efficiency of generic 3D segmentation backbone during an inference step by eliminating the need for SW. NMSW employs a differentiable Top-k module to selectively sample only the most relevant patches, thereby minimizing redundant computations. When patch-level predictions are insufficient, the framework intelligently leverages coarse global predictions to refine results. Evaluated across 3 tasks using 3 segmentation backbones, NMSW achieves competitive accuracy compared to SW inference while significantly reducing computational complexity by 91% (88.0 to 8.00 TMACs). Moreover, it delivers a 9.1x faster inference on the H100 GPU (99.0 to 8.3 sec) and a 11.1x faster inference on the Xeon Gold CPU (2110 to 189 sec). NMSW is model-agnostic, further boosting efficiency when integrated with any existing efficient segmentation backbones. The code is avaialble: https://github.com/Youngseok0001/open_nmsw.

<title>Leveraging Online Olympiad-Level Math Problems for LLMs Training and Contamination-Resistant Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

<title>Learning Non-Local Molecular Interactions via Equivariant Local Representations and Charge Equilibration</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) potentials relying on chemical locality offer near-quantum mechanical accuracy at significantly reduced computational costs. Message-passing GNNs model interactions beyond their immediate neighborhood by propagating local information between neighboring particles while remaining effectively local. However, locality precludes modeling long-range effects critical to many real-world systems, such as charge transfer, electrostatic interactions, and dispersion effects. In this work, we propose the Charge Equilibration Layer for Long-range Interactions (CELLI) to address the challenge of efficiently modeling non-local interactions. This novel architecture generalizes the classical charge equilibration (Qeq) method to a model-agnostic building block for modern equivariant GNN potentials. Therefore, CELLI extends the capability of GNNs to model long-range interactions while providing high interpretability through explicitly modeled charges. On benchmark systems, CELLI achieves state-of-the-art results for strictly local models. CELLI generalizes to diverse datasets and large structures while providing high computational efficiency and robust predictions.

Abstract: Transfers in professional football (soccer) are risky investments because of the large transfer fees and high risks involved. Although data-driven models can be used to improve transfer decisions, existing models focus on describing players' historical progress, leaving their future performance unknown. Moreover, recent developments have called for the use of explainable models combined with uncertainty quantification of predictions. This paper assesses explainable machine learning models based on predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification methods for the prediction of the future development in quality and transfer value of professional football players. The predictive accuracy is studied by training the models to predict the quality and value of players one year ahead. This is carried out by training them on two data sets containing data-driven indicators describing the player quality and player value in historical settings. In general, the random forest model is found to be the most suitable model because it provides accurate predictions as well as an uncertainty quantification method that naturally arises from the bagging procedure of the random forest model. Additionally, this research shows that the development of player performance contains nonlinear patterns and interactions between variables, and that time series information can provide useful information for the modeling of player performance metrics. The resulting models can help football clubs make more informed, data-driven transfer decisions by forecasting player quality and transfer value.

<title>Green LIME: Improving AI Explainability through Design of Experiments</title>

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI), the complexity of many models and processes surpasses human understanding, making it challenging to determine why a specific prediction is made. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in critical fields like healthcare, where trust in a model's predictions is paramount. As a result, the explainability of machine learning (ML) and other complex models has become a key area of focus. Efforts to improve model explainability often involve experimenting with AI systems and approximating their behavior through interpretable surrogate mechanisms. However, these procedures can be resource-intensive. Optimal design of experiments, which seeks to maximize the information obtained from a limited number of observations, offers promising methods for improving the efficiency of these explainability techniques. To demonstrate this potential, we explore Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), a widely used method introduced by Ribeiro et al. (2016). LIME provides explanations by generating new data points near the instance of interest and passing them through the model. While effective, this process can be computationally expensive, especially when predictions are costly or require many samples. LIME is highly versatile and can be applied to a wide range of models and datasets. In this work, we focus on models involving tabular data, regression tasks, and linear models as interpretable local approximations. By utilizing optimal design of experiments' techniques, we reduce the number of function evaluations of the complex model, thereby reducing the computational effort of LIME by a significant amount. We consider this modified version of LIME to be energy-efficient or "green".

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in document processing, robust text recognition has become increasingly critical for knowledge extraction. While OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for English and other languages benefits from large datasets and well-established benchmarks, Arabic OCR faces unique challenges due to its cursive script, right-to-left text flow, and complex typographic and calligraphic features. We present KITAB-Bench, a comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark that fills the gaps in current evaluation systems. Our benchmark comprises 8,809 samples across 9 major domains and 36 sub-domains, encompassing diverse document types including handwritten text, structured tables, and specialized coverage of 21 chart types for business intelligence. Our findings show that modern vision-language models (such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen) outperform traditional OCR approaches (like EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and Surya) by an average of 60% in Character Error Rate (CER). Furthermore, we highlight significant limitations of current Arabic OCR models, particularly in PDF-to-Markdown conversion, where the best model Gemini-2.0-Flash achieves only 65% accuracy. This underscores the challenges in accurately recognizing Arabic text, including issues with complex fonts, numeral recognition errors, word elongation, and table structure detection. This work establishes a rigorous evaluation framework that can drive improvements in Arabic document analysis methods and bridge the performance gap with English OCR technologies.

arXiv:2502.20244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate charged current neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. We consider a simplified framework to generate muon kinematic variables, specifically its energy and scattering angle. GAN models are trained on simulation data from \nuwro{} Monte Carlo event generator. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy. The models work for neutrino energy ranging from 300 MeV to 10 GeV. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics. It is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the distribution of muon kinematics.

<title>Learning Data-Driven Uncertainty Set Partitions for Robust and Adaptive Energy Forecasting with Missing Data</title>

Abstract: Short-term forecasting models typically assume the availability of input data (features) when they are deployed and in use. However, equipment failures, disruptions, cyberattacks, may lead to missing features when such models are used operationally, which could negatively affect forecast accuracy, and result in suboptimal operational decisions. In this paper, we use adaptive robust optimization and adversarial machine learning to develop forecasting models that seamlessly handle missing data operationally. We propose linear- and neural network-based forecasting models with parameters that adapt to available features, combining linear adaptation with a novel algorithm for learning data-driven uncertainty set partitions. The proposed adaptive models do not rely on identifying historical missing data patterns and are suitable for real-time operations under stringent time constraints. Extensive numerical experiments on short-term wind power forecasting considering horizons from 15 minutes to 4 hours ahead illustrate that our proposed adaptive models are on par with imputation when data are missing for very short periods (e.g., when only the latest measurement is missing) whereas they significantly outperform imputation when data are missing for longer periods. We further provide insights by showcasing how linear adaptation and data-driven partitions (even with a few subsets) approach the performance of the optimal, yet impractical, method of retraining for every possible realization of missing data.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is a powerful technique to train robust models against data distribution shift. This paper aims to solve regularized nonconvex DRO problems, where the uncertainty set is modeled by a so-called generalized Sinkhorn distance and the loss function is nonconvex and possibly unbounded. Such a distance allows to model uncertainty of distributions with different probability supports and divergence functions. For this class of regularized DRO problems, we derive a novel dual formulation taking the form of nested stochastic optimization, where the dual variable depends on the data sample. To solve the dual problem, we provide theoretical evidence to design a nested stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which leverages stochastic approximation to estimate the nested stochastic gradients. We study the convergence rate of nested SGD and establish polynomial iteration and sample complexities that are independent of the data size and parameter dimension, indicating its potential for solving large-scale DRO problems. We conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: The increasing demands for high-throughput and energy-efficient wireless communications are driving the adoption of extremely large antennas operating at high-frequency bands. In these regimes, multiple users will reside in the radiative near-field, and accurate localization becomes essential. Unlike conventional far-field systems that rely solely on DOA estimation, near-field localization exploits spherical wavefront propagation to recover both DOA and range information. While subspace-based methods, such as MUSIC and its extensions, offer high resolution and interpretability for near-field localization, their performance is significantly impacted by model assumptions, including non-coherent sources, well-calibrated arrays, and a sufficient number of snapshots. To address these limitations, this work proposes AI-aided subspace methods for near-field localization that enhance robustness to real-world challenges. Specifically, we introduce NF-SubspaceNet, a deep learning-augmented 2D MUSIC algorithm that learns a surrogate covariance matrix to improve localization under challenging conditions, and DCD-MUSIC, a cascaded AI-aided approach that decouples angle and range estimation to reduce computational complexity. We further develop a novel model-order-aware training method to accurately estimate the number of sources, that is combined with casting of near field subspace methods as AI models for learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform classical and existing deep-learning-based localization techniques, providing robust near-field localization even under coherent sources, miscalibrations, and few snapshots.

Abstract: While the matrix completion problem has attracted considerable attention over the decades, few works address the nonignorable missing issue and all have their limitations. In this article, we propose a nuclear norm regularized row- and column-wise matrix U-statistic loss function for the generalized nonignorable missing mechanism, a flexible and generally applicable missing mechanism which contains both ignorable and nonignorable missing mechanism assumptions. The proposed method achieves computational efficiency comparable to the existing missing-at-random approaches, while providing the near minimax optimal statistical convergence rate guarantees for the more general nonignorable missing case. We propose an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to solve the associated optimization problem, and characterize the interaction between algorithmic and statistical convergence. Simulations and real data analyzes further support the practical utility of the proposed method.

Abstract: We are interested in the estimation of a rank-one tensor signal when only a portion $\varepsilon$ of its noisy observation is available. We show that the study of this problem can be reduced to that of a random matrix model whose spectral analysis gives access to the reconstruction performance. These results shed light on and specify the loss of performance induced by an artificial reduction of the memory cost of a tensor via the deletion of a random part of its entries.

Abstract: This study presents a novel mathematical model derived from cohomology, leveraging the KEEL-proven theorem that establishes cohomology as tautological, generated by boundary classes of curves with fixed dual graphs. Simplicial complexes are constructed using skew-commutative graded algebra, and the structure theorem is applied to connect distinct homologies, enabling precise interpretations of the resulting geometric forms. The proposed model is utilized for protein structure analysis and prediction, with a specific application to the Flagellar Motor structure. This approach offers new insights into the geometric and algebraic foundations of biological macromolecular modeling, highlighting its potential for advancement in structural biology.

Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which AI systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It introduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for lifecycle decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators.

Abstract: Protecting cloud applications is critical in an era where security threats are increasingly sophisticated and persistent. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are particularly vulnerable, making innovative security approaches essential. This research explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Topic Modelling, to analyse security-related text data and anticipate potential threats. We focus on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) to extract meaningful patterns from data sources, including logs, reports, and deployment traces. Using the Gensim framework in Python, these methods categorise log entries into security-relevant topics (e.g., phishing, encryption failures). The identified topics are leveraged to highlight patterns indicative of security issues across CI/CD's continuous stages (build, test, deploy). This approach introduces a semantic layer that supports early vulnerability recognition and contextual understanding of runtime behaviours.

Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems, benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation. Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization. Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth and standardized workflows.

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.

Abstract: One-shot subset selection serves as an effective tool to reduce deep learning training costs by identifying an informative data subset based on the information extracted by an information extractor (IE). Traditional IEs, typically pre-trained on the target dataset, are inherently dataset-dependent. Foundation models (FMs) offer a promising alternative, potentially mitigating this limitation. This work investigates two key questions: (1) Can FM-based subset selection outperform traditional IE-based methods across diverse datasets? (2) Do all FMs perform equally well as IEs for subset selection? Extensive experiments uncovered surprising insights: FMs consistently outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets, whereas their advantage diminishes on coarse-grained datasets with noisy labels. Motivated by these finding, we propose RAM-APL (RAnking Mean-Accuracy of Pseudo-class Labels), a method tailored for fine-grained image datasets. RAM-APL leverages multiple FMs to enhance subset selection by exploiting their complementary strengths. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained datasets, including Oxford-IIIT Pet, Food-101, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011.

Abstract: Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of generative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention due to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering applications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and discretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and rectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and cross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces. This advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO provides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general advanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of standardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional generative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building fully autonomous agents. However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety. These human-agent collaboration systems enable humans and LLM-based agents to collaborate effectively by leveraging their complementary strengths. This paper provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these systems, including environment & profiling, human feedback, interaction types, orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses unique challenges and opportunities arising from human-AI collaboration. By consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities (vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal) reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500 samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558 communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization, network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders (GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease, where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers insights into disease mechanisms.

<div> Keywords: Context-Content Uncertainty Principle, operational principles, hierarchical layers, entropy minimization, brain and machine inference.

Summary:
The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) suggests that inference under uncertainty involves aligning high-entropy contexts with low-entropy content. This paper introduces a layered computational framework based on CCUP, starting with entropy minimization to prioritize content structuring. The framework includes four hierarchical layers: Core Inference Constraints (structure-first, asymmetric flow, cycle-consistency, conditional compression), Resource Allocation Principles (precision-weighted attention, learning rates, memory encoding), Temporal Bootstrapping Dynamics (learning organization over time), and Spatial Hierarchical Composition (integration of mechanisms). Formal theorems, dependency lattice, and computational simulations demonstrate the efficiency gains of CCUP-aligned inference. The brain is viewed as a cycle-consistent entropy resolver that aligns structure and specificity through content-driven simulation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered computational framework that derives operational principles from this foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression, all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates, and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula; and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

<div> diffusion model, generative modeling, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Diffusion Tree Sampling, Diffusion Tree Search

Summary:
Diffusion models are powerful tools in generative modeling, but adapting them to new objectives at inference time is challenging. Existing methods of guiding the model often provide inaccurate value estimates, especially in noisy conditions, leading to biased results. Additionally, past computations are not efficiently reused, leading to wasted compute resources. To address these issues, a new approach called Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) is introduced. By treating inference-time alignment as a search problem and reusing past computations in a tree-based approach, DTS produces accurate samples from the target distribution with significantly less compute. Its variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), is able to perform a global search for high reward samples efficiently. This innovative method allows for steady improvement in sample quality with additional compute resources, making it a scalable solution for inference-time alignment of diffusion models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation, DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$ effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to $5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of diffusion models.

<div> manifold hypothesis; diffusion models; local intrinsic dimension; FLIPD; LID estimation

Summary:
This paper addresses the manifold hypothesis in high-dimensional data spaces and the use of diffusion models (DMs) for learning low-dimensional submanifolds. It focuses on the estimation of local intrinsic dimension (LID) using an estimator called FLIPD, which has various applications such as quantifying data complexity and detecting outliers. The paper proves the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions, bridging a theoretical gap left by previous work. Additionally, it explores the use of uniform convolutions as an alternative to Gaussian ones and demonstrates the relevance of this approach. The findings contribute to a better understanding of how DMs can effectively learn and estimate the intrinsic dimensions of data submanifolds, leading to improved performance in various applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers, adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel, symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification for tackling complex scientific problems.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction, interpretation and Q\&amp;A atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization; and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents. Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and trustworthiness.

<div> Keywords: LLM, relation extraction, fine-tuning, dynamic weight-grafting, attention mechanisms

Summary: 
- The study investigates how LLMs retain relation information learned during fine-tuning processes.
- Existing localization methods do not effectively capture this process, leading to the proposal of dynamic weight-grafting approach.
- The proposed method demonstrates that LLMs both extract and recall relation information during processing and prediction stages.
- Different pathways exist for correct generation of fine-tuned information, with some cases requiring multiple pathways.
- The study analyzes the necessity, sufficiency, and redundancy of these information pathways, identifying task-specific attention mechanisms and relation extraction in output layers as key components. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases, corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g. activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and (2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the ``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

<div> Keywords: language models, training, hardware accelerators, precision formats, instabilities

Summary: 
Training large language models is computationally expensive, prompting the development of lower-precision arithmetic formats like Microscaling (MX). However, when training in MX formats, sharp stochastic instabilities in loss are observed, especially at larger compute scales. These instabilities are attributed to multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of activations, leading to runaway divergence. Intervention experiments show that modifying precision schemes mid-training can avert or delay instabilities. Stabilization strategies in the large language model (LLM) setting, including certain hybrid configurations, can recover performance competitive with full-precision training. The research conducted sheds light on the challenges and viability of block-scaled precision formats during model training and offers insights into maintaining stability and performance in training language models using lower-precision arithmetic. <div>
arXiv:2506.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX) formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from $2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with full-precision training. We release our code at https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

Summary:
- The article proposes a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning stochastic closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear dynamical systems of computational mechanics.
- This framework addresses the challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without clear scale separation, such as turbulent flows in engineering, where resolving all scales is computationally expensive.
- Classic closure modeling methods rely on deterministic and local assumptions, which can be too restrictive in regimes without clear scale separation.

Numerical results demonstrate successful discovery of a proper latent space with small reconstruction errors and good diffusion model performance. The integrated stochastic modeling framework accelerates computations while maintaining predictive accuracy compared to standard diffusion models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.20771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

The article introduces the Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) method as a more scalable and robust alternative to the Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD) for decomposing neural network parameters into simpler parts. The SPD method allows for decomposing larger and more complex models compared to APD, without issues like parameter shrinkage and better identification of ground truth mechanisms in toy models.

arXiv:2506.20790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

This approach helps to refine accelerator kernels iteratively without requiring deep architectural knowledge or extensive profiling. The methodology involves selecting prior code versions, generating optimization hypotheses based on existing code and general GPU literature, and autonomously implementing experiments using observed timing data as feedback.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors propose a method for deploying LSTM models on FPGAs using the FINN framework. They leverage the Scan operator from the ONNX specification to model LSTM computations, allowing for mixed quantisation and functional verification. Custom transformations in the FINN compiler map the quantised computation graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library. The proposed tool-flow is validated by training a quantised ConvLSTM model for mid-price stock prediction and generating a hardware IP targeting the XCZU7EV device. The generated accelerator achieves a balance between latency and resource consumption while maintaining accuracy with reduced precision. The authors believe that their approach will enable resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction. However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

Summary:
Hellsemble is a novel ensemble framework for binary classification that actively considers dataset complexity. It incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of difficulty and trains models on increasingly challenging subsets. A router model determines the most suitable base model for new instances based on inferred difficulty. This approach improves classification accuracy, maintains computational efficiency, and enhances interpretability. Experimental results on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks show that Hellsemble outperforms traditional ensemble methods. Embracing instance-level difficulty is identified as a promising direction for building efficient and robust ensemble systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance, but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel and efficient method for detecting adversarial examples in deep neural networks. While existing defense techniques focus on improving robustness or using a secondary model to detect attacks, this study emphasizes attack detection as a practical defense strategy. The proposed method analyzes the impact of attacks on different layers of a DNN by training a lightweight regression model to predict deeper-layer features from early-layer features, leveraging the prediction error to identify adversarial samples. The method is demonstrated to be highly effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, adaptable to any DNN architecture, and applicable across various domains including image, video, and audio. Through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments, the article showcases the superiority of the proposed approach in detecting adversarial input designs with limited noise budgets. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image, video, and audio.

- Information loss from graph partitioning and negative sampling methods contribute to performance degradation in distributed training of GNNs for link prediction.
- Sharing complete graph information with workers can maintain link prediction accuracy but incurs high communication costs.
- The proposed SpLPG leverages graph sparsification to mitigate performance degradation in link prediction during distributed training, reducing communication overhead by up to 80%.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored. This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving link prediction accuracy.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to data extraction attacks due to memorization during training. The impact of memorization in fine-tuning, especially with LoRA, a parameter-efficient method, is less explored. This study reveals a divergence in the effects of memorization between different fine-tuning strategies. Factors like model scale and data duplication, which affect memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not show the same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a relaxed similarity-based metric, it is demonstrated that LoRA reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning while maintaining strong task performance. This highlights the effectiveness of LoRA in mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong task performance.

<div> Keywords: output-reweighting unlearning, classifier, user deletion rights, biased predictions, membership inference attacks

Summary:<br />
In this work, the RWFT method is introduced as a lightweight technique for erasing a specific class from a trained classifier without the need for full retraining. This is important for enforcing user deletion rights and reducing biased predictions. Existing unlearning methods are costly and fail to accurately predict samples from the unlearned class. A new attack, MIA-NN, successfully reveals the unlearned class with these methods. RWFT proposes a redistribution of probability mass for predictions on samples from the forgotten class, which is robust to MIA-NN. A new metric based on total variation distance is introduced to quantify residual leakage and prevent susceptibility to attacks. Experimental results show that RWFT outperforms existing methods in both previously used metrics and the new TV-based metric, achieving a 2.79% improvement in the former and an impressive 111.45% improvement in the latter over the best existing method.<br /> <div>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV) distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45% in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that dynamically selects a subset of effective models from a preselected candidate set using feedback from a bipartite graph. This approach reduces computational complexity and results in smaller prediction sets. By incorporating prediction set size feedback alongside model loss, the algorithm efficiently constructs smaller prediction sets while still maintaining the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithm is proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the new method outperforms existing multi-model online conformal prediction approaches by constructing smaller prediction sets. <div>
arXiv:2506.20898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift, multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges. A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss, can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal prediction approaches.

<br />Summary:
This study focuses on offline reinforcement learning in average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which poses challenges due to distribution shift and non-uniform coverage. The researchers develop guarantees based on the target policy, using measures like bias span and policy hitting radius, without relying on complex measures like uniform mixing time. They introduce a novel algorithm that combines pessimistic discounted value iteration with quantile clipping, allowing for sharper penalty functions. The algorithm does not require prior parameter knowledge. The study also addresses general weakly communicating MDPs, without imposing restrictive assumptions. Hard examples show that learning under their conditions requires coverage assumptions beyond the target policy's stationary distribution. Lower bounds closely match the main results, reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in offline reinforcement learning scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2506.20904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy, specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs, contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy, distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

The integration of DL-LIME provides valuable insights into the decision-making process and highlights critical factors in radar resource management.

arXiv:2506.20916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM). However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI) techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel approach to chemical process optimization using a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents. These agents autonomously infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, eliminating the need for predefined bounds. The framework, named AutoGen, employs specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution, and optimization guidance. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process, the framework demonstrated competitive performance with conventional methods but with better computational efficiency, converging in under 20 minutes and achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. The reasoning-guided search showcased sophisticated process understanding by identifying utility trade-offs and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach has significant potential for optimization scenarios with poorly characterized constraints, especially for emerging processes and retrofit applications.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable, requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution, and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs, and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit applications.

<div> Keywords: symbolic rules, interpretable prediction models, logical propositions, sparse linear transformations, decision regions<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel approach to building interpretable prediction models using small additive ensembles of symbolic rules. These rules incorporate logical propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables, allowing for decision regions with oblique faces. By extending traditional rule ensembles in this way, the model complexity is significantly reduced while maintaining the same test risk as state-of-the-art methods. The learning method proposed in the article utilizes sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation of logistic regression. Experimental results on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in constructing rule ensembles with improved interpretability and accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2506.20927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables, i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where $\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across ten benchmark datasets.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the challenge of problematic datapoints in large language models trained on web data and introduces the MSA algorithm for estimating and undoing the influence of specific datapoints. Existing unlearning algorithms have limitations in accurately removing problematic data without complete retraining. MSA leverages model checkpoints to estimate and eliminate data influence effectively. Experimental results show that MSA outperforms other machine unlearning algorithms in various benchmarks and models, indicating its potential for creating more flexible large language models capable of data erasure.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces. Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\% rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new approach called Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) for improving the fine-tuning of Vision Language Models (VLMs) without using backpropagation. SharpZO combines a sharpness-aware evolutionary strategy stage with a sparse zeroth-order optimization stage to enhance performance. The method globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to create a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search. This approach allows for optimization using only forward passes, making it suitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. Experimental results on CLIP models show that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, outperforming existing forward-only methods by up to 7%. <div>
arXiv:2506.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

<div> keywords: explicit density learners, generative models, normalizing flows, knowledge distillation, compositional normalizing flows 

Summary: 
Explicit density learners, such as normalizing flows, are gaining popularity in generative modeling for their ability to accurately model probability distributions and perform exact latent-variable inference. While they have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks, they can be challenging to train and may have lower sampling quality. In this study, novel knowledge distillation techniques are proposed to enhance the sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows. By distilling knowledge within intermediate layers, smaller student models can achieve significant performance improvements compared to non-distilled students. This approach allows for a more efficient use of resources, as smaller models can increase throughput proportionally based on the number of bijectors and parameters in the network. This research aims to explore the capacities and limitations of knowledge distillation in Compositional Normalizing Flows to better understand the benefits offered by these architectures. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for generative models because of their ability to better model probability distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows. We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation, we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

Summary:
TRIDENT is a novel framework for molecular property prediction that integrates molecular SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn rich molecular representations. The framework utilizes a volume-based alignment objective to align tri-modal features at the global level, allowing for soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities. Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a local alignment objective to capture detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their corresponding sub-textual descriptions. By dynamically balancing global and local alignment through a momentum-based mechanism, the model can learn both broad functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for molecular property prediction. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities. Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for molecular property prediction.

<div> Keywords: Continual learning, Mixture-of-Experts, LoRA, Interference, Redundancy <br />
Summary: 
MoRA is a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach designed to address the challenges faced by large pre-trained models in continual learning. It tackles interference by decomposing updates into rank-1 components, reducing redundancy and enabling fine-grained expert utilization. By allowing each rank-1 expert to infer its relevance and adaptively selecting a sparse mixture of ranks per input, MoRA prevents ambiguous routing and stabilizes expert assignments. The proposed rank pruning and activation budgets further enhance the model's performance in continual learning tasks with CLIP and large language models, improving generalization and mitigating forgetting. MoRA's innovative approach shows significant effectiveness in enhancing continual learning with pre-trained models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.21035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components, each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1 expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while mitigating forgetting.

Summary:<br />
This paper examines how federated learning (FL) performance is affected by concept drift, where real-world data streams with shifting distributions. By modeling concept drift as a Markov chain and introducing the Stationary Generalization Error, the paper assesses a model's ability to capture characteristics of future unseen data. Three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, random) and their impact on FL performance are studied, with an algorithm proposed to mitigate performance degradation by regularizing empirical risk minimization with KL divergence and mutual information. The method shows consistent improvement over existing approaches for the drift patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to concept drift in FL. Experimental results on a Raspberry Pi4 FL testbed validate the approach, confirming the significant impact of drift patterns on performance and the successful mitigation of performance degradation through the proposed algorithm.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting concept drift in FL.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions, they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability. Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15% zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing methods.

<br /><br />Summary: FedDAA is a dynamic clustered FL framework addressing multi-source concept drift by detecting real drift and preserving historical knowledge. By integrating modules for cluster number determination and concept drift adaptation, FedDAA outperforms existing methods on various datasets, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements. <div>
arXiv:2506.21054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift (a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However, effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems, particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space, CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2 layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models, making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

Summary:
FeDa4Fair is introduced as a tool for evaluating fair Federated Learning (FL) methods in the presence of biased data distributions among clients. This tool aims to address the challenge of ensuring fairness in FL models, considering the diverse and conflicting fairness needs of different clients. The paper contributes by providing a library for generating tabular datasets, releasing four bias-heterogeneous datasets for benchmarking fairness mitigation methods, and offering functions for evaluating fairness outcomes. By enabling consistent benchmarking at both global and client levels, this research supports robust and reproducible fairness interventions in FL. The focus is on enhancing fairness for multiple sensitive attributes, rather than just binary ones, to ensure fair outcomes for all clients involved. <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways: (1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

<div> Concept-Based Models, Hierarchical Concept Memory Reasoner, interpretability, deep learning, neural attention mechanism

Summary:
The paper introduces Hierarchical Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new Concept-Based Model (CBM) that provides interpretability for both concept and task predictions. Unlike existing CBMs, H-CMR models relationships between concepts using a learned directed acyclic graph with logic rules defining concepts. It employs a neural attention mechanism to select and apply rules hierarchically for predicting concepts and tasks. Experimental results show that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while allowing for human interaction through concept and model interventions. Interventions can improve accuracy at inference time and enhance data efficiency during training with additional background knowledge. Overall, H-CMR enhances interpretability in deep learning models and offers a promising approach for explaining predictions through high-level concepts.

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task. However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is available.

<div> Keywords: Conditional computation, Transformers, dynamic skipping, gating mechanism, residual norms

Summary:
Conditional computation is a popular strategy to enhance the efficiency of Transformers. In this study, a novel architecture is proposed that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle outward. A learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input. A gated attention mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions. Residual norms are controlled using a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme, while gate sparsity is managed with adaptive regularization loss. The goal was to reduce compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and foster an emergent multi-level representational hierarchy. However, the approach did not yield improvements in the trade-off between validation cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer layers. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Proposal of a novel Transformer architecture for dynamic skipping of layers based on input
- Introduction of gating mechanism and gated attention to optimize computation
- Implementation of residual norms control and gate sparsity management
- Aim to reduce compute requirements and promote multi-level representational hierarchy
- Limited improvement in trade-off compared to dense baselines with fewer layers <div>

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g., mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another. However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions. Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

<div> Keywords: single-cell responses, gene regulatory network, data augmentation, perturbation signals, evaluation metric

Summary: 
The study introduces a framework called Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to address the challenge of unpaired single-cell response data collected under perturbed and unperturbed conditions. The framework utilizes gene regulatory network (GRN) information to propagate perturbation signals biologically and improve data generation quality through a masking mechanism that predicts silent genes. The study emphasizes the intrinsic heterogeneity in gene expression responses to perturbations, introducing a bimodal evaluation metric to better capture this variability. The proposed Unlasting model integrates dual conditional diffusion models to enhance insights into perturbations and improve data generation quality. Overall, the framework offers a novel approach to modeling single-cell responses across various perturbations by leveraging GRN information, addressing unpaired data challenges, and accurately capturing the heterogeneity in gene expression responses. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN) information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way, and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces an antifragile reinforcement learning framework for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance adaptability to adversarial attacks. The framework incorporates a switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS) to dynamically select among multiple robust policies to minimize distributional shifts in state-action-value distributions induced by attacks. By deriving a diverse ensemble of action robust policies and modeling them as a multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, the framework effectively adapts to evolving adversarial strategies. Theoretical analysis shows that optimizing DTS leads to effective adaptation against unseen attacks, inducing antifragility. Numerical simulations in complex navigation environments validate the framework's superior performance compared to conventional robust RL methods, demonstrating shorter path lengths and a higher rate of conflict-free navigation trajectories.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.21127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift, results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust, non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

<div> adversarial attacks, reinforcement learning, safety-critical systems, UAV navigation, antifragile framework<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This article presents a new approach to addressing vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning policies deployed in safety-critical systems, particularly in UAV navigation. The proposed antifragile RL framework is designed to adapt against incremental adversarial attacks in the observation space. The framework introduces a simulated attacker that incrementally increases the strength of perturbations in the observation space, allowing the RL agent to generalize across a wider range of out-of-distribution observations and anticipate unseen attacks. The article includes a theoretical characterization of fragility and antifragility, defining catastrophic forgetting and adaptation conditions. The method enforces bounds on value shifts through expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance minimization. Empirical evaluation in a UAV deconfliction scenario shows that the antifragile policy outperforms standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to adversarial attacks, achieving higher cumulative reward and fewer conflict events. This demonstrates the practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for secure decision-making in evolving threat environments.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat scenarios.

<div> Query Norm, Linear Attention, Entropy Reduction, Norm-Aware, Kernel Function

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel Norm-Aware Linear Attention (NaLaFormer) mechanism to address challenges in linear attention mechanisms. By decoupling query and key matrices into norm and direction components, NaLaFormer controls norm-aware spikiness and ensures norm consistency. It incorporates a query-norm aware kernel function to dynamically control entropy reduction based on query norms. A norm-preserving mapping is utilized to enforce non-negativity constraints and maintain norm distributions. Experimental results show that NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2%. The proposed mechanism effectively restores norm-guided dynamic spikiness and kernel-perturbed norm distributions. It highlights the importance of query norms in softmax normalization for entropy reduction and introduces a cosine similarity-based method to inhibit dimensions with opposite directions. NaLaFormer presents a promising approach to improving the effectiveness of linear attention mechanisms in various applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction, current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$ normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI) datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

Summary:
The paper presents a framework for detecting stealthy adversarial attacks on UAVs by utilizing conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to create attacks that evade traditional intrusion detection systems. These attacks are designed to appear benign while maintaining statistical similarities to out-of-distribution data. A multi-class IDS classifier is trained on various known cyber-attacks to identify these adversarial samples. A conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is implemented to differentiate between authentic out-of-distribution samples and adversarial inputs, outperforming traditional detection methods. The study highlights the importance of advanced probabilistic models in enhancing intrusion detection systems' resilience against adaptive cyber threats.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples; however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate. Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI), man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC. Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Summary: 
Linearity-based compression is proposed as a new method to reduce weights in neural networks by exploiting the linearity of neurons with ReLU-like activation functions. The approach allows for merging subsequent layers, resulting in a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original model size in most tested models. The method can be successfully combined with existing importance-based pruning techniques, showing little interference between different types of compression. This work introduces a novel method that lays the foundation for more efficient and smaller neural network models. <div>
arXiv:2506.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally. Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural network models.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations, in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment (i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps. Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information, assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates, preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness, Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using $62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and data to facilitate further research in this direction.

Abstract: Component obsolescence poses significant challenges in industries reliant on electronic components, causing increased costs and disruptions in the security and availability of systems. Accurate obsolescence risk prediction is essential but hindered by a lack of reliable data. This paper proposes a novel approach to forecasting obsolescence risk using zero-shot learning (ZSL) with large language models (LLMs) to address data limitations by leveraging domain-specific knowledge from tabular datasets. Applied to two real-world datasets, the method demonstrates effective risk prediction. A comparative evaluation of four LLMs underscores the importance of selecting the right model for specific forecasting tasks.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects. Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100 billion parameters.

<title>Improved seeding strategies for k-means and k-GMM</title>

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM (Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of analytical approaches.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work, we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average, improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving near-perfect load balancing.

<title>AGTCNet: A Graph-Temporal Approach for Principled Motor Imagery EEG Classification</title>

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems, existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset, AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and 2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability to independently process recent information or leverage contextual enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data will be made publicly available.

<title>Lipschitz Bounds for Persistent Laplacian Eigenvalues under One-Simplex Insertions</title>

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology, physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle, is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools, including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound: after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis. It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias, i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks from context.

Abstract: rQdia regularizes Q-value distributions with augmented images in pixel-based deep reinforcement learning. With a simple auxiliary loss, that equalizes these distributions via MSE, rQdia boosts DrQ and SAC on 9/12 and 10/12 tasks respectively in the MuJoCo Continuous Control Suite from pixels, and Data-Efficient Rainbow on 18/26 Atari Arcade environments. Gains are measured in both sample efficiency and longer-term training. Moreover, the addition of rQdia finally propels model-free continuous control from pixels over the state encoding baseline.

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

<title>Temporal-Aware Graph Attention Network for Cryptocurrency Transaction Fraud Detection</title>

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular in-context learning.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base parameters as prior work.

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75% reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to 1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate, one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline, offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential decision-making.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically, Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics, serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer pruning strategy.

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling. However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems, including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3 percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling, simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the development of digital twins for industrial environments.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24 anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets, underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and robust model selection.

<title>Where to find Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion, providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining, enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model complexity and improve the generalization bound.

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels. Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is possible and effective.

Abstract: A recent survey, nicknamed "Hitchhiker's Guide", J.J. Arias-Garc{\i}a, R. Mesiar, and B. De Baets, A hitchhiker's guide to quasi-copulas, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 393 (2020) 1-28, has raised the rating of quasi-copula problems in the dependence modeling community in spite of the lack of statistical interpretation of quasi-copulas. In our previous work (arXiv:2410.19339, accepted in Fuzzy Sets and Systems), we addressed the question of extreme values of the mass distribution associated with multivariate quasi-copulas. Using a linear programming approach, we were able to solve Open Problem 5 of the "Guide" up to dimension d = 17 and disprove a recent conjecture on the solution to that problem. In this paper, we use an analytical approach to provide a complete answer to the original question.

<title>Utility-Driven Speculative Decoding for Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: GPU memory bandwidth is the main bottleneck for low-latency Large Language Model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using a lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel, boosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are fetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging Mixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token, greatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is ineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights, increasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput gains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x, making it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model, and even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense LLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.
  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables speculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE serving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of token gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality, enabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each request, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during testing, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the utility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and evaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math, extraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding practical for MoEs.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines, which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by up to 1.23$\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to 1.73$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables training on 1.35$\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of modern protein folding models. We open source our code at https://github.com/Supercomputing-System-AI-Lab/MegaFold/.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module (channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium.

<title>scMamba: A Scalable Foundation Model for Single-Cell Multi-Omics Integration Beyond Highly Variable Feature Selection</title>

Abstract: The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has enabled the simultaneous profiling of diverse omics layers within individual cells. Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words (tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional, sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods. Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological discovery.

Abstract: Although there is a substantial body of literature on control and optimization problems for parabolic and hyperbolic systems, the specific problem of controlling and optimizing the coefficients of the associated operators within such systems has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this work, we aim to initiate a line of research in control theory focused on optimizing and controlling the coefficients of these operators-a problem that naturally arises in the context of neural networks and supervised learning.
  In supervised learning, the primary objective is to transport initial data toward target data through the layers of a neural network. We propose a novel perspective: neural networks can be interpreted as partial differential equations (PDEs). From this viewpoint, the control problem traditionally studied in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is reformulated as a control problem for PDEs, specifically targeting the optimization and control of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators. To the best of our knowledge, this specific problem has not yet been systematically addressed in the control theory of PDEs.
  To this end, we propose a dual system formulation for the control and optimization problem associated with parabolic PDEs, laying the groundwork for the development of efficient numerical schemes in future research. We also provide a theoretical proof showing that the control and optimization problem for parabolic PDEs admits minimizers. Finally, we investigate the control problem associated with hyperbolic PDEs and prove the existence of solutions for a corresponding approximated control problem.

<title>Stable Minima of ReLU Neural Networks Suffer from the Curse of Dimensionality: The Neural Shattering Phenomenon</title>

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and (2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an exponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\`a-vis low-norm solutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat solutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high dimensions.

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data, propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

Abstract: Estimating the governing equation parameter values is essential for integrating experimental data with scientific theory to understand, validate, and predict the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we propose a new method for structural system identification (SI), uncertainty quantification, and validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling frameworks, a neural network maps random noise to physically meaningful parameters. These parameters are then used in the known equation of motion to obtain fake accelerations, which are compared to real training data via a mean square error loss. To simultaneously validate the learned parameters, we use independent validation datasets. The generated accelerations from these datasets are evaluated by a discriminator network, which determines whether the output is real or fake, and guides the parameter-generator network. Analytical and real experiments show the parameter estimation accuracy and model validation for different nonlinear structural systems.

<title>The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should also result in better research after being executed. To test whether AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas, either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100 hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas in the absence of execution outcomes.

Abstract: Combining attention with recurrence has shown to be valuable in sequence modeling, including hydrological predictions. Here, we explore the strength of Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in rainfall-runoff modeling. We train ten randomly initialized models, TFT and LSTM, for 531 CAMELS catchments in the US. We repeat the experiment with five subsets of the Caravan dataset, each representing catchments in the US, Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, and Chile. Then, the performance of the models, their variability regarding the catchment attributes, and the difference according to the datasets are assessed. Our findings show that TFT slightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating the midsection and peak of hydrographs. Furthermore, we show the ability of TFT to handle longer sequences and why it can be a better candidate for higher or larger catchments. Being an explainable AI technique, TFT identifies the key dynamic and static variables, providing valuable scientific insights. However, both TFT and LSTM exhibit a considerable drop in performance with the Caravan dataset, indicating possible data quality issues. Overall, the study highlights the potential of TFT in improving hydrological modeling and understanding.

Abstract: Machine learning has significantly advanced the understanding and application of structural materials, with an increasing emphasis on integrating existing data and quantifying uncertainties in predictive modeling. This study presents a comprehensive methodology utilizing a mixed density network (MDN) model, trained on extensive experimental data from literature. This approach uniquely predicts the distribution of dislocation density, inferred as a latent variable, and the resulting stress distribution at the grain level. The incorporation of statistical parameters of those predicted distributions into a dislocation-mediated plasticity model allows for accurate stress-strain predictions with explicit uncertainty quantification. This strategy not only improves the accuracy and reliability of mechanical property predictions but also plays a vital role in optimizing alloy design, thereby facilitating the development of new materials in a rapidly evolving industry.

Abstract: Data-driven agriculture, which integrates technology and data into agricultural practices, has the potential to improve crop yield, disease resilience, and long-term soil health. However, privacy concerns, such as adverse pricing, discrimination, and resource manipulation, deter farmers from sharing data, as it can be used against them. To address this barrier, we propose a privacy-preserving framework that enables secure data sharing and collaboration for research and development while mitigating privacy risks. The framework combines dimensionality reduction techniques (like Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) and differential privacy by introducing Laplacian noise to protect sensitive information. The proposed framework allows researchers to identify potential collaborators for a target farmer and train personalized machine learning models either on the data of identified collaborators via federated learning or directly on the aggregated privacy-protected data. It also allows farmers to identify potential collaborators based on similarities. We have validated this on real-life datasets, demonstrating robust privacy protection against adversarial attacks and utility performance comparable to a centralized system. We demonstrate how this framework can facilitate collaboration among farmers and help researchers pursue broader research objectives. The adoption of the framework can empower researchers and policymakers to leverage agricultural data responsibly, paving the way for transformative advances in data-driven agriculture. By addressing critical privacy challenges, this work supports secure data integration, fostering innovation and sustainability in agricultural systems.

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

Abstract: We study value-iteration (VI) algorithms for solving general (a.k.a. multichain) Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the average-reward criterion, a fundamental but theoretically challenging setting. Beyond the difficulties inherent to all average-reward problems posed by the lack of contractivity and non-uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman operator, in the multichain setting an optimal policy must solve the navigation subproblem of steering towards the best connected component, in addition to optimizing long-run performance within each component. We develop algorithms which better solve this navigational subproblem in order to achieve faster convergence for multichain MDPs, obtaining improved rates of convergence and sharper measures of complexity relative to prior work. Many key components of our results are of potential independent interest, including novel connections between average-reward and discounted problems, optimal fixed-point methods for discounted VI which extend to general Banach spaces, new sublinear convergence rates for the discounted value error, and refined suboptimality decompositions for multichain MDPs. Overall our results yield faster convergence rates for discounted and average-reward problems and expand the theoretical foundations of VI approaches.

Abstract: As the deployment of large language models (LLMs) grows in sensitive domains, ensuring the integrity of their computational provenance becomes a critical challenge, particularly in regulated sectors such as healthcare, where strict requirements are applied in dataset usage. We introduce ZKPROV, a novel cryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance. It allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without revealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior approaches that focus on complete verification of the training process (incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution environments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically binds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through zero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step. By leveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments, ZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the LLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the ZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical solution for real-world deployments. We also provide formal security guarantees, proving that our approach preserves dataset confidentiality while ensuring trustworthy dataset provenance.

Abstract: This paper introduces an active learning framework for manifold Gaussian Process (GP) regression, combining manifold learning with strategic data selection to improve accuracy in high-dimensional spaces. Our method jointly optimizes a neural network for dimensionality reduction and a Gaussian process regressor in the latent space, supervised by an active learning criterion that minimizes global prediction error. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate superior performance over randomly sequential learning. The framework efficiently handles complex, discontinuous functions while preserving computational tractability, offering practical value for scientific and engineering applications. Future work will focus on scalability and uncertainty-aware manifold learning.

<title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent for Sector Rotation in the Taiwan Stock Market</title>

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely, the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum reinforcement learning in real-world finance.

<title>Lower Bounds on the Size of Markov Equivalence Classes</title>

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms typically recover causal graphs only up to their Markov equivalence classes unless additional parametric assumptions are made. The sizes of these equivalence classes reflect the limits of what can be learned about the underlying causal graph from purely observational data. Under the assumptions of acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and a uniform model prior, Markov equivalence classes are known to be small on average. In this paper, we show that this is no longer the case when any of these assumptions is relaxed. Specifically, we prove exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size of Markov equivalence classes in three settings: sparse random directed acyclic graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random directed cyclic graphs.

<title>Forecasting Geopolitical Events with a Sparse Temporal Fusion Transformer and Gaussian Process Hybrid: A Case Study in Middle Eastern and U.S. Conflict Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Forecasting geopolitical conflict from data sources like the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a critical challenge for national security. The inherent sparsity, burstiness, and overdispersion of such data cause standard deep learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), to produce unreliable long-horizon predictions. We introduce STFT-VNNGP, a hybrid architecture that won the 2023 Algorithms for Threat Detection (ATD) competition by overcoming these limitations. Designed to bridge this gap, our model employs a two-stage process: first, a TFT captures complex temporal dynamics to generate multi-quantile forecasts. These quantiles then serve as informed inputs for a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP), which performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty quantification. In a case study forecasting conflict dynamics in the Middle East and the U.S., STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms a standalone TFT, showing a superior ability to predict the timing and magnitude of bursty event periods, particularly at long-range horizons. This work offers a robust framework for generating more reliable and actionable intelligence from challenging event data, with all code and workflows made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by structuring retrieval over an external corpus. However, existing approaches typically assume a static corpus, requiring expensive full-graph reconstruction whenever new documents arrive, limiting their scalability in dynamic, evolving environments. To address these limitations, we introduce EraRAG, a novel multi-layered Graph-RAG framework that supports efficient and scalable dynamic updates. Our method leverages hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to partition and organize the original corpus into hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and localized insertions of new data without disrupting the existing topology. The design eliminates the need for retraining or costly recomputation while preserving high retrieval accuracy and low latency. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that EraRag achieves up to an order of magnitude reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing Graph-RAG systems, while providing superior accuracy performance. This work offers a practical path forward for RAG systems that must operate over continually growing corpora, bridging the gap between retrieval efficiency and adaptability. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/EverM0re/EraRAG-Official.

<title>Can Gradient Descent Simulate Prompting?</title>

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of gradient-based learning.

arXiv:2506.20995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows, aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively. Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task, conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

<title>HybridQ: Hybrid Classical-Quantum Generative Adversarial Network for Skin Disease Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10 times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware noise.

<title>Improving Diffusion-Based Image Editing Faithfulness via Guidance and Scheduling</title>

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved. However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across diverse tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for approximating the learning dynamics of multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting in a finite-state Markov game. The idea is to rescale the learning process by simultaneously reducing the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, effectively treating the agent's parameters as a slow-evolving variable influenced by the fast-mixing game state. Under mild assumptions-ergodicity of the state process and continuity of the updates-we prove the convergence of this rescaled process to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE provides a tractable, deterministic approximation of the agent's learning dynamics. An implementation of the framework is available at\,: https://github.com/yannKerzreho/MarkovGameApproximation

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable. Experimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens, EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%, and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However, most existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for the formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking, CovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent binding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks: reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent docking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer, we establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the benchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular transformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of the benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug design. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical challenges in therapeutic development.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion, disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1) accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/xulsh8/FlickCD.

Abstract: The real world naturally has dimensions of time and space. Therefore, estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in Colombia.

Abstract: This technical report presents submission systems for Task 4 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge. This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus, these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model. Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric. Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7% compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models (LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis, methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal. Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&amp;A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024, whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making strides towards level-2.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of data source diversity on the performance of cryptocurrency forecasting models by integrating various data categories, including technical indicators, on-chain metrics, sentiment and interest metrics, traditional market indices, and macroeconomic indicators. We introduce the Crypto100 index, representing the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and propose a novel feature reduction algorithm to identify the most impactful and resilient features from diverse data sources. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that data source diversity significantly enhances the predictive performance of forecasting models across different time horizons. Key findings include the paramount importance of on-chain metrics for both short-term and long-term predictions, the growing relevance of traditional market indices and macroeconomic indicators for longer-term forecasts, and substantial improvements in model accuracy when diverse data sources are utilized. These insights help demystify the short-term and long-term driving factors of the cryptocurrency market and lay the groundwork for developing more accurate and resilient forecasting models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables, better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent space utilization while offering a more expressive representation. Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF, which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions. Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training. The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series, eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge. Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

<title>Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size, are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres: Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze computational resource requirements across different adapter scales, demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher redundancy in their generations.

Abstract: It is a classical result in rational approximation theory that certain non-smooth or singular functions, such as $|x|$ and $x^{1/p}$, can be efficiently approximated using rational functions with root-exponential convergence in terms of degrees of freedom \cite{Sta, GN}. In contrast, polynomial approximations admit only algebraic convergence by Jackson's theorem \cite{Lub2}. Recent work shows that composite polynomial architectures can recover exponential approximation rates even without smoothness \cite{KY}. In this work, we introduce and analyze a class of weighted deep polynomial approximants tailored for functions with asymmetric behavior-growing unbounded on one side and decaying on the other. By multiplying a learnable deep polynomial with a one-sided weight, we capture both local non-smoothness and global growth. We show numerically that this framework outperforms Taylor, Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants, even when all use the same number of parameters. To optimize these approximants in practice, we propose a stable graph-based parameterization strategy building on \cite{Jar}.

Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation, consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand, leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.

Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real-world data.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11, and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for future research in this critical safety application.

Abstract: We describe and analyze a computionally efficient refitting procedure for computing high-probability upper bounds on the instance-wise mean-squared prediction error of penalized nonparametric estimates based on least-squares minimization. Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals, symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions, with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than 150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue systems.

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design, intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition, four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static, dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4 hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However, these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics. Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of performance.

Abstract: We develop sampling methods, which consist of Gaussian invariant versions of random walk Metropolis (RWM), Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and second order Hessian or Manifold MALA. Unlike standard RWM and MALA we show that Gaussian invariant sampling can lead to ergodic estimators with improved statistical efficiency. This is due to a remarkable property of Gaussian invariance that allows us to obtain exact analytical solutions to the Poisson equation for Gaussian targets. These solutions can be used to construct efficient and easy to use control variates for variance reduction of estimators under any intractable target. We demonstrate the new samplers and estimators in several examples, including high dimensional targets in latent Gaussian models where we compare against several advanced methods and obtain state-of-the-art results. We also provide theoretical results regarding geometric ergodicity, and an optimal scaling analysis that shows the dependence of the optimal acceptance rate on the Gaussianity of the target.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/AMOS-MM-Solution

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample, but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise, these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k without relying on external data.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with video prediction from the perspective of a human.

Abstract: This position paper argues that achieving robustness, privacy, and efficiency simultaneously in machine learning systems is infeasible under prevailing threat models. The tension between these goals arises not from algorithmic shortcomings but from structural limitations imposed by worst-case adversarial assumptions. We advocate for a systematic research agenda aimed at formalizing the robustness-privacy-efficiency trilemma, exploring how principled relaxations of threat models can unlock better trade-offs, and designing benchmarks that expose rather than obscure the compromises made. By shifting focus from aspirational universal guarantees to context-aware system design, the machine learning community can build models that are truly appropriate for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Given a sequence of tokens, such as words, the task of next-token prediction is to predict the next-token conditional probability distribution. Decoder-only transformers have become effective models for this task, but their properties are still not fully understood. In particular, the largest number of distinct context sequences that a decoder-only transformer can interpolate next-token distributions for has not been established. To fill this gap, we prove upper and lower bounds on this number, which are equal up to a multiplicative constant. We prove these bounds in the general setting where next-token distributions can be arbitrary as well as the empirical setting where they are calculated from a finite number of document sequences. Our lower bounds are for one-layer multi-head decoder-only transformers and our proofs highlight an important injectivity property satisfied by self-attention. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that the minimal number of parameters for memorization is sufficient for being able to train the model to the entropy lower bound.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the online saddle point problem, which involves a sequence of two-player time-varying convex-concave games. Considering the nonstationarity of the environment, we adopt the duality gap and the dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as performance metrics for algorithm design. We present three variants of the proximal point method: the Online Proximal Point Method (OPPM), the Optimistic OPPM (OptOPPM), and the OptOPPM with multiple predictors. Each algorithm guarantees upper bounds for both the duality gap and dynamic Nash equilibrium regret, achieving near-optimality when measured against the duality gap. Specifically, in certain benign environments, such as sequences of stationary payoff functions, these algorithms maintain a nearly constant metric bound. Experimental results further validate the effectiveness of these algorithms. Lastly, this paper discusses potential reliability concerns associated with using dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as a performance metric. The technical appendix and code can be found at https://github.com/qingxin6174/PPM-for-OSP.

Abstract: Target-group detection is the task of detecting which group(s) a social media post is ``directed at or about'', with various applications, such as targeted-marketing. In this work, we focus on the fairness implications of target-group detection in the context of toxicity detection, where the perceived harm of a post often depends on which group(s) it targets. Because toxicity is highly contextual, language that appears benign in general may be harmful when targeting specific demographic groups. It is thus important to first detect which group(s) are being {\em targeted} by a post as a precursor to the subsequent task of determining whether the post is toxic given the group(s). Target-group detection is also challenging: a single post may simultaneously target one to many groups, and we must detect groups fairly in order to promote equitable treatment. We show that our proposed approach to {\em fairness-aware multi target-group detection} not only reduces bias across groups, but also achieves competitive predictive performance, outperforming existing fairness-aware baselines. To spur future research on fairness-aware target-group detection and support competitive benchmarking, we also share our code.

Abstract: In the last years, many learning-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, models operating on Euclidean coordinates are ill-suited for non-Euclidean, asymmetric problem instances that are often found in real-world settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based solvers.

Abstract: Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance, therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time. In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using deep learning methods. We propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network for the application of gyroscope calibration. We explore the possibilities of using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we recorded a dataset consisting of 186.6 hours of gyroscope readings, using 36 gyroscopes of four different brands. We also created a virtual dataset consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The six datasets were used to evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes. Our dataset is publicly available to allow reproducibility of our work and to increase research in the field.

Abstract: Influence functions provide a principled method to assess the contribution of individual training samples to a specific target. Yet, their high computational costs limit their applications on large-scale models and datasets. Existing methods proposed for influence function approximation have significantly reduced the computational overheads. However, they mostly suffer from inaccurate estimation due to the lack of strong convergence guarantees from the algorithm. The family of hyperpower methods are well-known for their rigorous convergence guarantees on matrix inverse approximation, while the matrix multiplication operation can involve intractable memory and computation costs on large-scale models. We propose HyperINF, an efficient and accurate influence function approximation method which leverages the hyperpower method, specifically Schulz's iterative algorithm. To deal with the computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate the generalized fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the memory and computation overheads to constant costs independent of ranks on LoRA-tuned models. We first demonstrate the superior accuracy and stability of HyperINF compared to other baselines through a synthetic convergence simulation for matrix inversion. We further validate the efficacy of HyperINF through extensive real-world data attribution tasks, including mislabeled data detection and data selection for LLM and VLM fine-tuning. On LoRA-tuned models, HyperINF achieves superior downstream performance with minimal memory and computational overhead, while other baselines suffer from significant degradation.

Abstract: Modern vision models have achieved remarkable success in benchmarks where local features provide critical information about the target. There is now a growing interest in tackling tasks requiring more global reasoning, where local features do not provide significant information. Minsky and Papert put forward such tasks in 1969 with their connectivity study, exposing the limitations of the perceptron model. In this paper, we introduce an expanded set of global visual datasets involving graphs, strings, mazes, and image grids. We show that large vision models still struggle to learn these tasks efficiently. Similarly, state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs perform poorly on these datasets. We explain this learning inefficiency by means of the 'globality degree' measure. To mitigate this, we propose a method called chain-of-sketch (CoS). Similar to the chain-of-thought and scratchpad techniques used in language models, CoS breaks the original task into intermediate visual steps to help learn a complex task. In addition, we show that not all CoS strategies perform equally well. Our key insight is to impose a Markovian structure on the CoS frames. This leads to the introduction of 'inductive CoS' which achieves better out-of-distribution generalization and performs well even with smaller models compared to non-inductive variants.

Abstract: Operator learning, the approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using machine learning, has gained increasing research attention in recent years. Approximate operators, learned from data, can serve as efficient surrogate models for problems in computational science and engineering, complementing traditional methods. However, despite their empirical success, our understanding of the underlying mathematical theory is in large part still incomplete. In this paper, we study the approximation of Lipschitz operators with respect to Gaussian measures. We prove higher Gaussian Sobolev regularity of Lipschitz operators and establish lower and upper bounds on the Hermite polynomial approximation error. We then study general reconstruction strategies of Lipschitz operators from $m$ arbitrary (potentially adaptive) linear samples. As a key finding, we tightly characterize the corresponding sample complexity, that is, the smallest achievable worst-case error among all possible choices of (adaptive) sampling and reconstruction strategies in terms of $m$. As a consequence, we identify an inherent curse of sample complexity: No method to approximate Lipschitz operators based on $m$ linear samples can achieve algebraic convergence rates in $m$. On the positive side, we prove that a sufficiently fast spectral decay of the covariance operator of the underlying Gaussian measure guarantees convergence rates which are arbitrarily close to any algebraic rate. Overall, by tightly characterizing the sample complexity, our work confirms the intrinsic difficulty of learning Lipschitz operators, regardless of the data or learning technique.

<title>Reducing Biases in Record Matching Through Scores Calibration</title>

Abstract: Record matching is the task of identifying records that refer to the same real-world entity across datasets. While most existing models optimize for accuracy, fairness has become an important concern due to the potential for unequal outcomes across demographic groups. Prior work typically focuses on binary outcomes evaluated at fixed decision thresholds. However, such evaluations can miss biases in matching scores--biases that persist across thresholds and affect downstream tasks. We propose a threshold-independent framework for measuring and reducing score bias, defined as disparities in the distribution of matching scores across groups. We show that several state-of-the-art matching methods exhibit substantial score bias, even when appearing fair under standard threshold-based metrics. To address this, we introduce two post-processing score calibration algorithms. The first, calib, aligns group-wise score distributions using the Wasserstein barycenter, targeting demographic parity. The second, ccalib, conditions on predicted labels to further reduce label-dependent biases, such as equal opportunity. Both methods are model-agnostic and require no access to model training data. calib also offers theoretical guarantees, ensuring reduced bias with minimal deviation from original scores. Experiments across real-world datasets and matching models confirm that calib and ccalib substantially reduce score bias while minimally impacting model accuracy.

Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.

Abstract: Simulating and controlling physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial tasks across science and engineering. Recently, diffusion generative models have emerged as a competitive class of methods for these tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and model high-dimensional states. However, diffusion models typically struggle with handling system states with abrupt changes and generalizing to higher resolutions. In this work, we propose Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator (WDNO), a novel PDE simulation and control framework that enhances the handling of these complexities. WDNO comprises two key innovations. Firstly, WDNO performs diffusion-based generative modeling in the wavelet domain for the entire trajectory to handle abrupt changes and long-term dependencies effectively. Secondly, to address the issue of poor generalization across different resolutions, which is one of the fundamental tasks in modeling physical systems, we introduce multi-resolution training. We validate WDNO on five physical systems, including 1D advection equation, three challenging physical systems with abrupt changes (1D Burgers' equation, 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equation and 2D incompressible fluid), and a real-world dataset ERA5, which demonstrates superior performance on both simulation and control tasks over state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in long-term and detail prediction accuracy. Remarkably, in the challenging context of the 2D high-dimensional and indirect control task aimed at reducing smoke leakage, WDNO reduces the leakage by 78% compared to the second-best baseline.

Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization abilities, e.g. generating unseen, but natural data. However, the greater the generalization power, the more likely the unintended generalization, and the more dangerous the abuse. Research on moderated generalization in SGMs remains limited. To fill this gap, we first examine the current 'gold standard' in Machine Unlearning (MU), i.e., re-training the model after removing the undesirable training data, and find it does not work in SGMs. Further analysis of score functions reveals that the MU 'gold standard' does not alter the original score function, which explains its ineffectiveness. Based on this insight, we propose the first Moderated Score-based Generative Model (MSGM), which introduces a novel score adjustment strategy that redirects the score function away from undesirable data during the continuous-time stochastic differential equation process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGM significantly reduces the likelihood of generating undesirable content while preserving high visual quality for normal image generation. Albeit designed for SGMs, MSGM is a general and flexible MU framework that is compatible with diverse diffusion architectures (SGM and DDPM) and training strategies (re-training and fine-tuning), and enables zero-shot transfer of the pre-trained models to downstream tasks, e.g. image inpainting and reconstruction. The code will be shared upon acceptance.

Abstract: We study conditions under which transformers using soft attention can simulate hard attention, that is, effectively focus all attention on a subset of positions. First, we examine several subclasses of languages recognized by hard-attention transformers, which can be defined in variants of linear temporal logic. We demonstrate how soft-attention transformers can compute formulas of these logics using unbounded positional embeddings or temperature scaling. Second, we demonstrate how temperature scaling allows softmax transformers to simulate general hard-attention transformers, using a temperature that depends on the minimum gap between the maximum attention scores and other attention scores.

<title>On the Ability of Deep Networks to Learn Symmetries from Data: A Neural Kernel Theory</title>

Abstract: Symmetries (transformations by group actions) are present in many datasets, and leveraging them holds considerable promise for improving predictions in machine learning. In this work, we aim to understand when and how deep networks -- with standard architectures trained in a standard, supervised way -- learn symmetries from data. Inspired by real-world scenarios, we study a classification paradigm where data symmetries are only partially observed during training: some classes include all transformations of a cyclic group, while others -- only a subset. In the infinite-width limit, where kernel analogies apply, we derive a neural kernel theory of symmetry learning. The group-cyclic nature of the dataset allows us to analyze the Gram matrix of neural kernels in the Fourier domain; here we find a simple characterization of the generalization error as a function of class separation (signal) and class-orbit density (noise). This characterization reveals that generalization can only be successful when the local structure of the data prevails over its non-local, symmetry-induced structure, in the kernel space defined by the architecture. We extend our theoretical treatment to any finite group, including non-abelian groups. Our framework also applies to equivariant architectures (e.g., CNNs), and recovers their success in the special case where the architecture matches the inherent symmetry of the data. Empirically, our theory reproduces the generalization failure of finite-width networks (MLP, CNN, ViT) trained on partially observed versions of rotated-MNIST. We conclude that conventional deep networks lack a mechanism to learn symmetries that have not been explicitly embedded in their architecture a priori. Our framework could be extended to guide the design of architectures and training procedures able to learn symmetries from data.

Abstract: We study the Lagrange Index Policy (LIP) for restless multi-armed bandits with long-run average reward. In particular, we compare the performance of LIP with the performance of the Whittle Index Policy (WIP), both heuristic policies known to be asymptotically optimal under certain natural conditions. Even though in most cases their performances are very similar, in the cases when WIP shows bad performance, LIP continues to perform very well. We then propose reinforcement learning algorithms, both tabular and NN-based, to obtain online learning schemes for LIP in the model-free setting. The proposed reinforcement learning schemes for LIP require significantly less memory than the analogous schemes for WIP. We calculate analytically the Lagrange index for the restart model, which applies to the optimal web crawling and the minimization of the weighted age of information. We also give a new proof of asymptotic optimality in case of homogeneous arms as the number of arms goes to infinity, based on exchangeability and de Finetti's theorem.

Abstract: Accurate imputation of missing laboratory values in electronic health records (EHRs) is critical to enable robust clinical predictions and reduce biases in AI systems in healthcare. Existing methods, such as XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN, Expectation Maximization (EM), and MICE, struggle to model the complex temporal and contextual dependencies in EHR data, particularly in underrepresented groups. In this work, we propose Lab-MAE, a novel transformer-based masked autoencoder framework that leverages self-supervised learning for the imputation of continuous sequential lab values. Lab-MAE introduces a structured encoding scheme that jointly models laboratory test values and their corresponding timestamps, enabling explicit capturing temporal dependencies. Empirical evaluation on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrates that Lab-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN, EM, and MICE across multiple metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Wasserstein distance (WD). Notably, Lab-MAE achieves equitable performance across demographic groups of patients, advancing fairness in clinical predictions. We further investigate the role of follow-up laboratory values as potential shortcut features, revealing Lab-MAE's robustness in scenarios where such data is unavailable. The findings suggest that our transformer-based architecture, adapted to the characteristics of EHR data, offers a foundation model for more accurate and fair clinical imputation. In addition, we measure and compare the carbon footprint of Lab-MAE with the a XGBoost model, highlighting its environmental requirements.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting in power systems often involves multi-entity datasets like households, feeders, and wind turbines, where generating reliable entity-specific forecasts presents significant challenges. Traditional approaches require training individual models for each entity, making them inefficient and hard to scale. This study addresses this problem using GUIDE-VAE, a conditional variational autoencoder that allows entity-specific probabilistic forecasting using a single model. GUIDE-VAE provides flexible outputs, ranging from interpretable point estimates to full probability distributions, thanks to its advanced covariance composition structure. These distributions capture uncertainty and temporal dependencies, offering richer insights than traditional methods. To evaluate our GUIDE-VAE-based forecaster, we use household electricity consumption data as a case study due to its multi-entity and highly stochastic nature. Experimental results demonstrate that GUIDE-VAE outperforms conventional quantile regression techniques across key metrics while ensuring scalability and versatility. These features make GUIDE-VAE a powerful and generalizable tool for probabilistic forecasting tasks, with potential applications beyond household electricity consumption.

Abstract: We consider the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, where an unknown reward function of some Markov decision process is estimated based on observed expert demonstrations. In most existing approaches, IRL is formulated and solved as a nonconvex optimization problem, posing challenges in scenarios where robustness and reproducibility are critical. We discuss a convex formulation of the IRL problem (CIRL) initially proposed by Ng and Russel, and reformulate the problem such that the domain-specific language CVXPY can be applied directly to specify and solve the convex problem. We also extend the CIRL problem to scenarios where the expert policy is not given analytically but by trajectory as state-action pairs, which can be strongly inconsistent with optimality, by augmenting some of the constraints. Theoretical analysis and practical implementation for hyperparameter auto-selection are introduced. This note helps the users to easily apply CIRL for their problems, without background knowledge on convex optimization.

Abstract: This paper proposes Genetic Algorithm with Border Trades (GAB), a novel modification of the standard genetic algorithm that enhances exploration by incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process. This approach significantly mitigates premature convergence and improves search diversity. Empirically, GAB achieves up to 8x higher fitness and 10x faster convergence on complex job scheduling problems compared to standard Genetic Algorithms, reaching average fitness scores of 888 versus 106 in under 20 seconds. On the classic Flip-Flop problem, GAB consistently finds optimal or near-optimal solutions in fewer generations, even as input sizes scale to thousands of bits. These results highlight GAB as a highly effective and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: Sparse variational Gaussian processes (GPs) construct tractable posterior approximations to GP models. At the core of these methods is the assumption that the true posterior distribution over training function values ${\bf f}$ and inducing variables ${\bf u}$ is approximated by a variational distribution that incorporates the conditional GP prior $p({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ in its factorization. While this assumption is considered as fundamental, we show that for model training we can relax it through the use of a more general variational distribution $q({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ that depends on $N$ extra parameters, where $N$ is the number of training examples. In GP regression, we can analytically optimize the evidence lower bound over the extra parameters and express a tractable collapsed bound that is tighter than the previous bound. The new bound is also amenable to stochastic optimization and its implementation requires minor modifications to existing sparse GP code. Further, we also describe extensions to non-Gaussian likelihoods. On several datasets we demonstrate that our method can reduce bias when learning the hyperparameters and can lead to better predictive performance.

Abstract: In the realm of activity detection for massive machine-type communications, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have shown significant potential in enhancing coverage for devices lacking direct connections to the base station (BS). However, traditional activity detection methods are typically designed for a single type of channel model, which does not reflect the complexities of real-world scenarios, particularly in systems incorporating IRS. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines model-driven deep unfolding with a mixture of experts (MoE) framework. By automatically selecting one of three expert designs and applying it to the unfolded projected gradient method, our approach eliminates the need for prior knowledge of channel types between devices and the BS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MoE-augmented deep unfolding method surpasses the traditional covariance-based method and black-box neural network design, delivering superior detection performance under mixed channel fading conditions.

Abstract: In self-supervised contrastive learning, negative pairs are typically constructed using an anchor image and a sample drawn from the entire dataset, excluding the anchor. However, this approach can result in the creation of negative pairs with similar semantics, referred to as "false negatives", leading to their embeddings being falsely pushed apart. To address this issue, we introduce GloFND, an optimization-based approach that automatically learns on the fly the threshold for each anchor data to identify its false negatives during training. In contrast to previous methods for false negative discovery, our approach globally detects false negatives across the entire dataset rather than locally within the mini-batch. Moreover, its per-iteration computation cost remains independent of the dataset size. Experimental results on image and image-text data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/vibalcam/GloFND.

Abstract: We propose VIBE, a model-agnostic framework that trains classifiers resilient to backdoor attacks. The key concept behind our approach is to treat malicious inputs and corrupted labels from the training dataset as observed random variables, while the actual clean labels are latent. VIBE then recovers the corresponding latent clean label posterior through variational inference. The resulting training procedure follows the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The E-step infers the clean pseudolabels by solving an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, while the M-step updates the classifier parameters via gradient descent. Being modular, VIBE can seamlessly integrate with recent advancements in self-supervised representation learning, which enhance its ability to resist backdoor attacks. We experimentally validate the method effectiveness against contemporary backdoor attacks on standard datasets, a large-scale setup with 1$k$ classes, and a dataset poisoned with multiple attacks. VIBE consistently outperforms previous defenses across all tested scenarios.

Abstract: Studies often aim to reveal ``first-order" representations (FORs), which encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as contents or structure. A less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are ``about" FORs -- e.g., their strength or uncertainty -- and which may contribute to learning. HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting noisy estimation processes incorporating prior expectations about uncertainty, but how the brain represents such expected uncertainty distributions remains largely unexplored. Here, we study ``noise expectation" HORs using neural data from a task which may require the brain to learn about its own noise: decoded neurofeedback, wherein human subjects learn to volitionally produce target neural patterns. We develop and apply a Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model to characterize how brains may undertake this process, and show that NERD offers high explanatory power for human behavior.

<title>Capacity-Constrained Online Learning with Delays: Scheduling Frameworks and Regret Trade-offs</title>

Abstract: We study online learning with oblivious losses and delays under a novel ``capacity constraint'' that limits how many past rounds can be tracked simultaneously for delayed feedback. Under ``clairvoyance'' (i.e., delay durations are revealed upfront each round) and/or ``preemptibility'' (i.e., we can stop tracking previously chosen round feedback), we establish matching upper and lower bounds (up to logarithmic terms) on achievable regret, characterizing the ``optimal capacity'' needed to match the minimax rates of classical delayed online learning, which implicitly assume unlimited capacity. Our algorithms achieve minimax-optimal regret across all capacity levels, with performance gracefully degrading under suboptimal capacity. For $K$ actions and total delay $D$ over $T$ rounds, under clairvoyance and assuming capacity $C = \Omega(\log(T))$, we achieve regret $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{TK + DK/C + D\log(K)})$ for bandits and $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{(D+T)\log(K)})$ for full-information feedback. When replacing clairvoyance with preemptibility, we require a known maximum delay bound $d_{\max}$, adding ${\widetilde{O}(d_{\max})}$ to the regret. For fixed delays $d$ (i.e., $D=Td$), the minimax regret is $\Theta(\sqrt{TK(1+d/C)+Td\log(K)})$ and the optimal capacity is $\Theta(\min\{K/\log(K),d\})$ in the bandit setting, while in the full-information feedback setting, the minimax regret is $\Theta(\sqrt{T(d+1)\log(K)})$ and the optimal capacity is $\Theta(1)$. For round-dependent and fixed delays, our upper bounds are achieved using novel preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling policies, based on Pareto-distributed proxy delays, and batching techniques, respectively. Crucially, our work unifies delayed bandits, label-efficient learning, and online scheduling frameworks, demonstrating that robust online learning under delayed feedback is possible with surprisingly modest tracking capacity.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained foundation models for diverse downstream tasks is a core practice in artificial intelligence. However, the wide range of tasks and high computational costs make full fine-tuning impractical. To overcome this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have emerged and are becoming a growing research focus. Despite the success of these methods, they are primarily designed for linear layers, focusing on two-dimensional matrices while largely ignoring higher-dimensional parameter spaces like convolutional kernels. Moreover, directly applying these methods to higher-dimensional parameter spaces often disrupts their structural relationships. Given the rapid advancements in matrix-based PEFT methods, rather than designing a specialized strategy, we propose a generalization that extends matrix-based PEFT methods to higher-dimensional parameter spaces without compromising their structural properties. Specifically, we treat parameters as elements of a Lie group, with updates modeled as perturbations in the corresponding Lie algebra. These perturbations are mapped back to the Lie group through the exponential map, ensuring smooth, consistent updates that preserve the inherent structure of the parameter space. Extensive experiments on computer vision and natural language processing validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach, demonstrating clear improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a framework which generalizes "decision making with structured observations" by allowing robust (i.e. multivalued) models. In this framework, each model associates each decision with a convex set of probability distributions over outcomes. Nature can choose distributions out of this set in an arbitrary (adversarial) manner, that can be nonoblivious and depend on past history. The resulting framework offers much greater generality than classical bandits and reinforcement learning, since the realizability assumption becomes much weaker and more realistic. We then derive a theory of regret bounds for this framework. Although our lower and upper bounds are not tight, they are sufficient to fully characterize power-law learnability. We demonstrate this theory in two special cases: robust linear bandits and tabular robust online reinforcement learning. In both cases, we derive regret bounds that improve state-of-the-art (except that we do not address computational efficiency).

<title>Energy Matching: Unifying Flow Matching and Energy-Based Models for Generative Modeling</title>

Abstract: The most widely used generative models map noise and data distributions by matching flows or scores. However, they struggle to incorporate partial observations and additional priors--something energy-based models (EBMs) handle elegantly by simply adding corresponding scalar energy terms. We address this issue by proposing Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples move along curl-free, optimal transport paths from noise to data. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize this dynamic with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. Our method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in terms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the method's flexibility to introduce an interaction energy that supports diverse mode exploration, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein-generation setting. Our approach focuses on learning a scalar potential energy--without time-conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks--which marks a significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe that this simplified framework significantly advances EBMs capabilities and paves the way for their wider adoption in generative modeling across diverse domains.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across diverse graph-based tasks by leveraging message passing to capture complex node relationships. However, when applied to large-scale real-world graphs, GNNs face two major challenges: First, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure both scalability and efficiency, as the repeated aggregation of large neighborhoods leads to significant computational overhead; Second, the over-smoothing problem arises, where excessive or deep propagation makes node representations indistinguishable, severely hindering model expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we propose ScaleGNN, a novel framework that adaptively fuses multi-hop node features for both scalable and effective graph learning. First, we construct per-hop pure neighbor matrices that capture only the exclusive structural information at each hop, avoiding the redundancy of conventional aggregation. Then, an enhanced feature fusion strategy significantly balances low-order and high-order information, preserving both local detail and global correlations without incurring excessive complexity. To further reduce redundancy and over-smoothing, we introduce a Local Contribution Score (LCS)-based masking mechanism to filter out less relevant high-order neighbors, ensuring that only the most meaningful information is aggregated. In addition, learnable sparse constraints selectively integrate multi-hop valuable features, emphasizing the most informative high-order neighbors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ScaleGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting its practical value for large-scale graph learning.

<title>Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</title>

Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific approaches in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability. Code is available at github.com/ASK-Berkeley/OM-TPS.

Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.

<title>Learning Value of Information towards Joint Communication and Control in 6G V2X</title>

Abstract: As Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) evolves towards future sixth-generation (6G) networks, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are emerging to become a key application. Leveraging data-driven Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), is expected to significantly enhance CAV decision-making in both vehicle control and V2X communication under uncertainty. These two decision-making processes are closely intertwined, with the value of information (VoI) acting as a crucial bridge between them. In this paper, we introduce Sequential Stochastic Decision Process (SSDP) models to define and assess VoI, demonstrating their application in optimizing communication systems for CAVs. Specifically, we formally define the SSDP model and demonstrate that the MDP model is a special case of it. The SSDP model offers a key advantage by explicitly representing the set of information that can enhance decision-making when available. Furthermore, as current research on VoI remains fragmented, we propose a systematic VoI modeling framework grounded in the MDP, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Optimal Control theories. We define different categories of VoI and discuss their corresponding estimation methods. Finally, we present a structured approach to leverage the various VoI metrics for optimizing the ``When", ``What", and ``How" to communicate problems. For this purpose, SSDP models are formulated with VoI-associated reward functions derived from VoI-based optimization objectives. While we use a simple vehicle-following control problem to illustrate the proposed methodology, it holds significant potential to facilitate the joint optimization of stochastic, sequential control and communication decisions in a wide range of networked control systems.

Abstract: We introduce the first method for translating text embeddings from one vector space to another without any paired data, encoders, or predefined sets of matches. Our unsupervised approach translates any embedding to and from a universal latent representation (i.e., a universal semantic structure conjectured by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis). Our translations achieve high cosine similarity across model pairs with different architectures, parameter counts, and training datasets.
  The ability to translate unknown embeddings into a different space while preserving their geometry has serious implications for the security of vector databases. An adversary with access only to embedding vectors can extract sensitive information about the underlying documents, sufficient for classification and attribute inference.

Abstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior. This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions. Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted dynamics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy. Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner. However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works, places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\% zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly compressed LLMs.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, to enhance the robustness against both channel noise and transmission data distribution shifts. A theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality, consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization. To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space. Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in graph representation learning and have been applied to various domains. However, many real-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles in social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is performed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning protocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the privacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of GNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy guarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node classification accuracy) for graph learning. Despite these advantages, such protocols may be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, a threat that has not been considered in previous research. Identifying and addressing these threats is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph learning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack targeting locally private graph learning protocols. The attacker injects fake users into the protocol, manipulates these fake users to establish links with genuine users, and sends carefully crafted data to the server, ultimately compromising the utility of private graph learning. The effectiveness of the attack is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. In addition, several defense strategies have also been explored, but their limited effectiveness highlights the need for more robust defenses.

Abstract: Optimal transport between graphs, based on Gromov-Wasserstein and
  other extensions, is a powerful tool for comparing and aligning
  graph structures. However, solving the associated non-convex
  optimization problems is computationally expensive, which limits the
  scalability of these methods to large graphs. In this work, we
  present Unbalanced Learning of Optimal Transport (ULOT), a deep
  learning method that predicts optimal transport plans between two
  graphs. Our method is trained by minimizing the fused unbalanced
  Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) loss. We propose a novel neural
  architecture with cross-attention that is conditioned on the FUGW
  tradeoff hyperparameters. We evaluate ULOT on synthetic stochastic
  block model (SBM) graphs and on real cortical surface data obtained
  from fMRI. ULOT predicts transport plans with competitive loss up to
  two orders of magnitude faster than classical solvers. Furthermore,
  the predicted plan can be used as a warm start for classical solvers
  to accelerate their convergence. Finally, the predicted transport
  plan is fully differentiable with respect to the graph inputs and
  FUGW hyperparameters, enabling the optimization of functionals of
  the ULOT plan.

Abstract: When a deep learning model is trained sequentially on different datasets, it often forgets the knowledge learned from previous data, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. This damages the model's performance on diverse datasets, which is critical in privacy-preserving deep learning (PPDL) applications based on transfer learning (TL). To overcome this, we introduce "review learning" (RevL), a low cost continual learning algorithm for diagnosis prediction using electronic health records (EHR) within a PPDL framework. RevL generates data samples from the model which are used to review knowledge from previous datasets. Six simulated institutional experiments and one real-world experiment involving three medical institutions were conducted to validate RevL, using three binary classification EHR data. In the real-world experiment with data from 106,508 patients, the mean global area under the receiver operating curve was 0.710 for RevL and 0.655 for TL. These results demonstrate RevL's ability to retain previously learned knowledge and its effectiveness in real-world PPDL scenarios. Our work establishes a realistic pipeline for PPDL research based on model transfers across institutions and highlights the practicality of continual learning in real-world medical settings using private EHR data.

Abstract: While the integration of transformers in vision models have yielded significant improvements on vision tasks they still require significant amounts of computation for both training and inference. Restricted attention mechanisms significantly reduce these computational burdens but come at the cost of losing either global or local coherence. We propose a simple, yet powerful method to reduce these trade-offs: allow the attention heads of a single transformer to attend to multiple receptive fields.
  We demonstrate our method utilizing Neighborhood Attention (NA) and integrate it into a StyleGAN based architecture for image generation. With this work, dubbed StyleNAT, we are able to achieve a FID of 2.05 on FFHQ, a 6% improvement over StyleGAN-XL, while utilizing 28% fewer parameters and with 4$\times$ the throughput capacity. StyleNAT achieves the Pareto Frontier on FFHQ-256 and demonstrates powerful and efficient image generation on other datasets.

Abstract: In this research, we investigate the high-dimensional linear contextual bandit problem where the number of features $p$ is greater than the budget $T$, or it may even be infinite. Differing from the majority of previous works in this field, we do not impose sparsity on the regression coefficients. Instead, we rely on recent findings on overparameterized models, which enables us to analyze the performance of the minimum-norm interpolating estimator when data distributions have small effective ranks. We propose an explore-then-commit (EtC) algorithm to address this problem and examine its performance. Through our analysis, we derive the optimal rate of the ETC algorithm in terms of $T$ and show that this rate can be achieved by balancing exploration and exploitation. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive explore-then-commit (AEtC) algorithm that adaptively finds the optimal balance. We assess the performance of the proposed algorithms through a series of simulations.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating within Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) encounter security challenges due to the dynamic and distributed nature of these networks. Previous studies focused predominantly on centralized intrusion detection, assuming a central entity responsible for storing and analyzing data from all devices. However, these approaches face challenges including computation and storage costs, along with a single point of failure risk, threatening data privacy and availability. The widespread dispersion of data across interconnected devices underscores the need for decentralized approaches. This paper introduces the Federated Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (FL-IDS), addressing challenges encountered by centralized systems in FANETs. FL-IDS reduces computation and storage costs for both clients and the central server, which is crucial for resource-constrained UAVs. Operating in a decentralized manner, FL-IDS enables UAVs to collaboratively train a global intrusion detection model without sharing raw data, thus avoiding delay in decisions based on collected data, as is often the case with traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate FL-IDS's competitive performance with Central IDS (C-IDS) while mitigating privacy concerns, with the Bias Towards Specific Clients (BTSC) method further enhancing FL-IDS performance even at lower attacker ratios. Comparative analysis with traditional intrusion detection methods, including Local IDS (L-IDS), sheds light on the strengths of FL-IDS. This study significantly contributes to UAV security by introducing a privacy-aware, decentralized intrusion detection approach tailored to UAV networks. Moreover, by introducing a realistic dataset for FANETs and federated learning, our approach differs from others lacking high dynamism and 3D node movements or accurate federated data federations.

Abstract: Black-box query-based attacks constitute significant threats to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems since they can generate adversarial examples without accessing the target model's architecture and parameters. Traditional defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training, gradient masking, and input transformations, either impose substantial computational costs or compromise the test accuracy of non-adversarial inputs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient defense mechanism, PuriDefense, that employs random patch-wise purifications with an ensemble of lightweight purification models at a low level of inference cost. These models leverage the local implicit function and rebuild the natural image manifold. Our theoretical analysis suggests that this approach slows down the convergence of query-based attacks by incorporating randomness into purifications. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our proposed purifier-based defense mechanism, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against query-based attacks.

Abstract: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector technology offers a wealth of high-resolution information on particle interactions, and leveraging that information to its full potential requires sophisticated automated reconstruction techniques. This article describes NuGraph2, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for low-level reconstruction of simulated neutrino interactions in a LArTPC detector. Simulated neutrino interactions in the MicroBooNE detector geometry are described as heterogeneous graphs, with energy depositions on each detector plane forming nodes on planar subgraphs. The network utilizes a multi-head attention message-passing mechanism to perform background filtering and semantic labelling on these graph nodes, identifying those associated with the primary physics interaction with 98.0\% efficiency and labelling them according to particle type with 94.9\% efficiency. The network operates directly on detector observables across multiple 2D representations, but utilizes a 3D-context-aware mechanism to encourage consistency between these representations. Model inference takes 0.12~s/event on a CPU, and 0.005s/event batched on a GPU. This architecture is designed to be a general-purpose solution for particle reconstruction in neutrino physics, with the potential for deployment across a broad range of detector technologies, and offers a core convolution engine that can be leveraged for a variety of tasks beyond the two described in this article.

<title>Self-Regulated Neurogenesis for Online Data-Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning sequences of tasks or data streams, unlike humans who can continuously learn and consolidate new concepts even in the absence of explicit cues. Online data-incremental learning seeks to emulate this capability by processing each sample only once, without having access to task or stream cues at any point in time since this is more realistic compared to offline setups, where all data from novel class(es) is assumed to be readily available. However, existing methods typically rely on storing the subsets of data in memory or expanding the initial model architecture, resulting in significant computational overhead. Drawing inspiration from 'self-regulated neurogenesis'-brain's mechanism for creating specialized regions or circuits for distinct functions-we propose a novel approach SERENA which encodes each concept in a specialized network path called 'concept cell', integrated into a single over-parameterized network. Once a concept is learned, its corresponding concept cell is frozen, effectively preventing the forgetting of previously acquired information. Furthermore, we introduce two new continual learning scenarios that more closely reflect real-world conditions, characterized by gradually changing sample sizes. Experimental results show that our method not only establishes new state-of-the-art results across ten benchmarks but also remarkably surpasses offline supervised batch learning performance. The code is available at https://github.com/muratonuryildirim/serena.

Abstract: A wide range of Deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) models integrates continuous and low dimensional representations of words and documents. Surprisingly, very few models study representation learning for authors. These representations can be used for many NLP tasks, such as author identification and classification, or in recommendation systems. A strong limitation of existing works is that they do not explicitly capture writing style, making them hardly applicable to literary data. We therefore propose a new architecture based on Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) that learns embeddings for both authors and documents with a stylistic constraint. Our model fine-tunes a pre-trained document encoder. We stimulate the detection of writing style by adding predefined stylistic features making the representation axis interpretable with respect to writing style indicators. We evaluate our method on three datasets: a literary corpus extracted from the Gutenberg Project, the Blog Authorship Corpus and IMDb62, for which we show that it matches or outperforms strong/recent baselines in authorship attribution while capturing much more accurately the authors stylistic aspects.

Abstract: We study stochastic second-order methods for solving general non-convex optimization problems. We propose using a special version of momentum to stabilize the stochastic gradient and Hessian estimates in Newton's method. We show that momentum provably improves the variance of stochastic estimates and allows the method to converge for any noise level. Using the cubic regularization technique, we prove a global convergence rate for our method on general non-convex problems to a second-order stationary point, even when using only a single stochastic data sample per iteration. This starkly contrasts with all existing stochastic second-order methods for non-convex problems, which typically require large batches. Therefore, we are the first to demonstrate global convergence for batches of arbitrary size in the non-convex case for the Stochastic Cubic Newton. Additionally, we show improved speed on convex stochastic problems for our regularized Newton methods with momentum.

Abstract: The modeling of industrial scenes is essential for simulations in industrial manufacturing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/SceneGenAgent .

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude drone imagery, addressing key challenges in urban traffic monitoring and the limitations of traditional ground-based systems. Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.

<title>Prompting with Phonemes: Enhancing LLMs' Multilinguality for Non-Latin Script Languages</title>

arXiv:2411.02398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although multilingual LLMs have achieved remarkable performance across benchmarks, we find they continue to underperform on non-Latin script languages across contemporary LLM families. This discrepancy arises from the fact that LLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin characters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts. We propose leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals to induce script-invariant representations. Our study demonstrates that integrating phonemic signals improves performance across both non-Latin and Latin script languages, with a particularly significant impact on closing the performance gap between the two. Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and orthographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL). This motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further aggregation from both leads to our significant performance improvements for both Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to 15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which predicts the probability of a user clicking an ad, is a fundamental task in recommender systems. The emergence of heterogeneous information, such as user profile and behavior sequences, depicts user interests from different aspects. A mutually beneficial integration of heterogeneous information is the cornerstone towards the success of CTR prediction. However, most of the existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) insufficient inter-mode interaction due to the unidirectional information flow between modes, and (2) aggressive information aggregation caused by early summarization, resulting in excessive information loss. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel module named InterFormer to learn heterogeneous information interaction in an interleaving style. To achieve better interaction learning, InterFormer enables bidirectional information flow for mutually beneficial learning across different modes. To avoid aggressive information aggregation, we retain complete information in each data mode and use a separate bridging arch for effective information selection and summarization. Our proposed InterFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset.

Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64*64. Extensive ablation studies, including out-of-distribution evaluations, further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/opendilab/PRG.

Abstract: In this work, a scalable quantum neural network is introduced as a means to approximate any unitary evolution through the Standard Recursive Block Basis (SRBB) and, subsequently, redesigned with a number of CNOTs asymptotically reduced by an exponential contribution. This algebraic approach to the problem of unitary synthesis exploits Lie algebras and their topological features to obtain scalable parameterizations of unitary operators. First, the original SRBB-based scalability scheme, already known in the literature only from a theoretical point of view, is reformulated for efficient algorithm implementation and complexity management. Remarkably, 2-qubit operators emerge as a special case outside the original scaling scheme. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed to reduce the number of CNOTs, thus deriving a new implementable scaling scheme that requires only one layer of approximation. The scalable CNOT-reduced quantum neural network is implemented and its performance is assessed with a variety of different unitary matrices, both sparse and dense, up to 6 qubits via the PennyLane library. The effectiveness of the approximation is measured with different metrics in relation to two optimizers: a gradient-based method and the Nelder-Mead method. The approximate CNOT-reduced SRBB-based synthesis algorithm is also tested on real hardware and compared with other valid approximation and decomposition methods available in the literature.

<title>Radio Map Estimation via Latent Domain Plug-and-Play Denoising</title>

Abstract: Radio map estimation (RME), also known as spectrum cartography, aims to reconstruct the strength of radio interference across different domains (e.g., space and frequency) from sparsely sampled measurements. To tackle this typical inverse problem, state-of-the-art RME methods rely on handcrafted or data-driven structural information of radio maps. However, the former often struggles to model complex radio frequency (RF) environments and the latter requires excessive training -- making it hard to quickly adapt to in situ sensing tasks. This work presents a spatio-spectral RME approach based on plug-and-play (PnP) denoising, a technique from computational imaging. The idea is to leverage the observation that the denoising operations of signals like natural images and radio maps are similar -- despite the nontrivial differences of the signals themselves. Hence, sophisticated denoisers designed for or learned from natural images can be directly employed to assist RME, avoiding using radio map data for training. Unlike conventional PnP methods that operate directly in the data domain, the proposed method exploits the underlying physical structure of radio maps and proposes an ADMM algorithm that denoises in a latent domain. This design significantly improves computational efficiency and enhances noise robustness. Theoretical aspects, e.g., recoverability of the complete radio map and convergence of the ADMM algorithm are analyzed. Synthetic and real data experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: The computation of the dominant eigenvector of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices is a cornerstone operation in numerous optimization-driven applications. Traditional methods, typically based on the \textit{Quotient} formulation, often suffer from challenges related to computational efficiency and reliance on prior spectral knowledge. In this work, we leverage the alternative \textit{Difference} formulation to reinterpret the classical power method as a first-order optimization algorithm. This perspective allows for a novel convergence analysis and facilitates the development of accelerated variants with larger step-sizes, achieving faster convergence without additional computational cost. Building on this insight, we introduce a generalized family of Difference-based methods, with the power method as a special case. Within this family, we propose Split-Merge, an algorithm that attains accelerated convergence without requiring spectral knowledge and operates solely via matrix-vector products. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Split-Merge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and scalability. In particular, it achieves more than a $\boldsymbol{10\times}$ speedup over the classical power method, underscoring its practical effectiveness for large-scale problems.

Abstract: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of multi-armed bandits (IMAB) that are widely used in neuroscience and psychology research for behavior modelling. We first show that the IMAB problem is not convex in general, but can be relaxed to a convex problem via variable transformation. Based on this result, we propose a two-step sequential heuristic for (approximately) solving the IMAB problem. We discuss a condition where our method provides global solution to the IMAB problem with certificate, as well as approximations to further save computing time. Numerical experiments indicate that our heuristic method is more robust than directly solving the IMAB problem via repeated local optimization, and can achieve the performance of Monte Carlo methods within a significantly decreased running time. We provide the implementation of our method based on CVXPY, which allows straightforward application by users not well versed in convex optimization.

Abstract: The Latent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is a powerful tool for time series and sequence modeling. However, training Latent SDEs typically relies on adjoint sensitivity methods, which depend on simulation and backpropagation through approximate SDE solutions, which limit scalability. In this work, we propose SDE Matching, a new simulation-free method for training Latent SDEs. Inspired by modern Score- and Flow Matching algorithms for learning generative dynamics, we extend these ideas to the domain of stochastic dynamics for time series and sequence modeling, eliminating the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that SDE Matching achieves performance comparable to adjoint sensitivity methods while drastically reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in next-generation communication systems is challenged by the heterogeneity of traffic and network conditions, which call for the use of highly contextual, site-specific, data. A promising solution is to rely not only on real-world data, but also on synthetic pseudo-data generated by a network digital twin (NDT). However, the effectiveness of this approach hinges on the accuracy of the NDT, which can vary widely across different contexts. To address this problem, this paper introduces context-aware doubly-robust (CDR) learning, a novel semi-supervised scheme that adapts its reliance on the pseudo-data to the different levels of fidelity of the NDT across contexts. CDR is evaluated on the task of downlink beamforming where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches, providing a 24% loss decrease when compared to doubly-robust (DR) semi-supervised learning in regimes with low labeled data availability.

Abstract: We study the optimization of non-convex functions that are not necessarily smooth (gradient and/or Hessian are Lipschitz) using first order methods. Smoothness is a restrictive assumption in machine learning in both theory and practice, motivating significant recent work on finding first order stationary points of functions satisfying generalizations of smoothness with first order methods. We develop a novel framework that lets us systematically study the convergence of a large class of first-order optimization algorithms (which we call decrease procedures) under generalizations of smoothness. We instantiate our framework to analyze the convergence of first order optimization algorithms to first and \textit{second} order stationary points under generalizations of smoothness. As a consequence, we establish the first convergence guarantees for first order methods to second order stationary points under generalizations of smoothness. We demonstrate that several canonical examples fall under our framework, and highlight practical implications.

Abstract: Discrete latent factor models (DLFMs) are widely used in various domains such as machine learning, economics, neuroscience, psychology, etc. Currently, fitting a DLFM to some dataset relies on a customized solver for individual models, which requires lots of effort to implement and is limited to the targeted specific instance of DLFMs. In this paper, we propose a generic framework based on CVXPY, which allows users to specify and solve the fitting problem of a wide range of DLFMs, including both regression and classification models, within a very short script. Our framework is flexible and inherently supports the integration of regularization terms and constraints on the DLFM parameters and latent factors, such that the users can easily prototype the DLFM structure according to their dataset and application scenario. We introduce our open-source Python implementation and illustrate the framework in several examples.

arXiv:2504.16320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 6-Degree of Freedom (DoF) grasp method based on point clouds has shown significant potential in enabling robots to grasp target objects. However, most existing methods are based on the point clouds (2.5D points) generated from single-view depth images. These point clouds only have one surface side of the object providing incomplete geometry information, which mislead the grasping algorithm to judge the shape of the target object, resulting in low grasping accuracy. Humans can accurately grasp objects from a single view by leveraging their geometry experience to estimate object shapes. Inspired by humans, we propose a novel 6-DoF grasping framework that converts the point completion results as object shape features to train the 6-DoF grasp network. Here, point completion can generate approximate complete points from the 2.5D points similar to the human geometry experience, and converting it as shape features is the way to utilize it to improve grasp efficiency. Furthermore, due to the gap between the network generation and actual execution, we integrate a score filter into our framework to select more executable grasp proposals for the real robot. This enables our method to maintain a high grasp quality in any camera viewpoint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that utilizing complete point features enables the generation of significantly more accurate grasp proposals and the inclusion of a score filter greatly enhances the credibility of real-world robot grasping. Our method achieves a 17.8\% success rate higher than the state-of-the-art method in real-world experiments.

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.

Abstract: While the capabilities and utility of AI systems have advanced, rigorous norms for evaluating these systems have lagged. Grand claims, such as models achieving general reasoning capabilities, are supported with model performance on narrow benchmarks, like performance on graduate-level exam questions, which provide a limited and potentially misleading assessment. We provide a structured approach for reasoning about the types of evaluative claims that can be made given the available evidence. For instance, our framework helps determine whether performance on a mathematical benchmark is an indication of the ability to solve problems on math tests or instead indicates a broader ability to reason. Our framework is well-suited for the contemporary paradigm in machine learning, where various stakeholders provide measurements and evaluations that downstream users use to validate their claims and decisions. At the same time, our framework also informs the construction of evaluations designed to speak to the validity of the relevant claims. By leveraging psychometrics' breakdown of validity, evaluations can prioritize the most critical facets for a given claim, improving empirical utility and decision-making efficacy. We illustrate our framework through detailed case studies of vision and language model evaluations, highlighting how explicitly considering validity strengthens the connection between evaluation evidence and the claims being made.

<title>A3 : an Analytical Low-Rank Approximation Framework for Attention</title>

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however, their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$, and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that $\tt A^\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example, under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2, outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the versatility of $\tt A^\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and mixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.

<title>Sharp concentration of uniform generalization errors in binary linear classification</title>

Abstract: We examine the concentration of uniform generalization errors around their expectation in binary linear classification problems via an isoperimetric argument. In particular, we establish Poincar\'{e} and log-Sobolev inequalities for the joint distribution of the output labels and the label-weighted input vectors, which we apply to derive concentration bounds. The derived concentration bounds are sharp up to moderate multiplicative constants by those under well-balanced labels. In asymptotic analysis, we also show that almost sure convergence of uniform generalization errors to their expectation occurs in very broad settings, such as proportionally high-dimensional regimes. Using this convergence, we establish uniform laws of large numbers under dimension-free conditions.

Abstract: This study analyzes tract-level real estate ownership patterns in New York State (NYS) and New York City (NYC) to uncover racial disparities. We use an advanced race/ethnicity imputation model (LSTM+Geo with XGBoost filtering, validated at 89.2% accuracy) to compare the predicted racial composition of property owners to the resident population from census data. We examine both a Full Model (statewide) and a Name-Only LSTM Model (NYC) to assess how incorporating geospatial context affects our predictions and disparity estimates. The results reveal significant inequities: White individuals hold a disproportionate share of properties and property value relative to their population, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities are underrepresented as property owners. These disparities are most pronounced in minority-majority neighborhoods, where ownership is predominantly White despite a predominantly non-White population. Corporate ownership (LLCs, trusts, etc.) exacerbates these gaps by reducing owner-occupied opportunities in urban minority communities. We provide a breakdown of ownership vs. population by race for majority-White, -Black, -Hispanic, and -Asian tracts, identify those with extreme ownership disparities, and compare patterns in urban, suburban, and rural contexts. The findings underscore persistent racial inequity in property ownership, reflecting broader historical and socio-economic forces, and highlight the importance of data-driven approaches to address these issues.

Abstract: Large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and Claude have become incredibly powerful at generating text, but they are still black boxes, so it is hard to understand how they decide what to say. That lack of transparency can be problematic, especially in fields where trust and accountability matter. To help with this, we introduce SMILE, a new method that explains how these models respond to different parts of a prompt. SMILE is model-agnostic and works by slightly changing the input, measuring how the output changes, and then highlighting which words had the most impact. Create simple visual heat maps showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested SMILE on several leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency, stability, and fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations. By making these models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to making AI more transparent and trustworthy.

<title>TaxaDiffusion: Progressively Trained Diffusion Model for Fine-Grained Species Generation</title>

arXiv:2506.01923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

Abstract: Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can effectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM. Our code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.

<title>Metis-RISE: RL Incentivizes and SFT Enhances Multimodal Reasoning Model Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

Abstract: An effective reward model plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning for post-training enhancement of visual generative models. However, current approaches of reward modeling suffer from implementation complexity due to their reliance on extensive human-annotated preference data or meticulously engineered quality dimensions that are often incomplete and engineering-intensive. Inspired by adversarial training in generative adversarial networks (GANs), this paper proposes GAN-RM, an efficient reward modeling framework that eliminates manual preference annotation and explicit quality dimension engineering. Our method trains the reward model through discrimination between a small set of representative, unpaired target samples(denoted as Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated ordinary outputs, requiring only a few hundred target samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our GAN-RM's effectiveness across multiple key applications including test-time scaling implemented as Best-of-N sample filtering, post-training approaches like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Visualignment/GAN-RM.

Abstract: Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL. Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL): adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement. Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks, and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.

TabArena is introduced as a continuously maintained living tabular benchmarking system, addressing the need for updated benchmarks in the rapidly evolving field of deep learning for tabular data. The study highlights the impact of validation methods and hyperparameter ensembling on benchmarking models effectively.

The use of ensembles across models has advanced the state-of-the-art in tabular machine learning, showcasing the strengths of individual models and the benefits of combining them. The launch of TabArena includes a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance protocols, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field. <div>

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models, conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard, and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.

Summary: 
Reinforcement learning methods have been used to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). This study focuses on Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies on intrinsic signals from the model itself instead of external rewards. The researchers explore various internal feedback strategies using unsupervised reward proxies like token-level entropy and trajectory-level entropy. Results show that RLIF can improve the reasoning performance of base LLMs early in training, even surpassing other techniques. However, as training progresses, performance begins to decline. RLIF is found to offer minimal benefits for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns on intrinsic feedback. By analyzing model weights, the study provides insights into why RLIF's training behaviors change over time. Practical guidelines are also provided for incorporating internal feedback signals into LLM training, aiming to inform more effective strategies for post-training LLMs. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods, Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on identifying heterogeneous parameter components in distributed M-estimation with minimal data transmission. Two methods are explored: the re-normalized Wald test, consistent for small K and dense heterogeneity, and the extreme contrast test (ECT), consistent for large K and sparse heterogeneity. ECT, using sample splitting, avoids bias accumulation and is communication-efficient. A combined approach enhances power across varying levels of heterogeneity sparsity. Extensive numerical experiments compare Family-wise Error Rate (FWER) and power of the methods. A case study illustrates method implementation and validity. The research contributes practical, efficient techniques for identifying heterogeneous parameter components in distributed M-estimation, exhibiting consistency and robust power in different data scenarios. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.16394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study methods for identifying heterogeneous parameter components in distributed M-estimation with minimal data transmission. One is based on a re-normalized Wald test, which is shown to be consistent as long as the number of distributed data blocks $K$ is of a smaller order of the minimum block sample size and the level of heterogeneity is dense. The second one is an extreme contrast test (ECT) based on the difference between the largest and smallest component-wise estimated parameters among data blocks. By introducing a sample splitting procedure, the ECT can avoid the bias accumulation arising from the M-estimation procedures, and exhibits consistency for $K$ being much larger than the sample size while the heterogeneity is sparse. The ECT procedure is easy to operate and communication-efficient. A combination of the Wald and the extreme contrast tests is formulated to attain more robust power under varying levels of sparsity of the heterogeneity. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments to compare the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the power of the proposed methods. Additionally, we conduct a case study to present the implementation and validity of the proposed methods.

Summary: 
Machine learning research has been advancing rapidly, leading to an increase in publications, but also a rise in misleading or incorrect studies being accepted at ML conferences. This highlights the need for a dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track at ML conferences to challenge existing research and promote a self-correcting research ecosystem. The proposed track would provide a platform for critical analysis of prior research, facilitating the correction of mistakes and fostering a dynamic research community. Key considerations for the track include design, review principles, and potential pitfalls, aiming to enhance the overall quality and credibility of ML research. In conclusion, establishing official mechanisms for refutations and critiques at ML conferences is crucial for the field to self-correct and ensure the integrity of research outputs.

Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML research self-correct.

The paper introduces a new algorithm called STIMULUS for multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems. STIMULUS utilizes a recursive framework to update stochastic gradient estimates and improve convergence performance with low sample complexity. An enhanced version, STIMULUS-M, incorporates a momentum term for faster convergence. The proposed methods achieve $O(1/T)$ convergence rates for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex settings, with state-of-the-art sample complexities of $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln ({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings. Enhanced versions with adaptive batching, STIMULUS+ and STIMULUS-M+, are also proposed to reduce the need for periodic full gradient evaluations. <div>
arXiv:2506.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multi-objective optimization (MOO) has gained attention for its broad applications in ML, operations research, and engineering. However, MOO algorithm design remains in its infancy and many existing MOO methods suffer from unsatisfactory convergence rate and sample complexity performance. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called STIMULUS( stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive e\ulstimator), a new and robust approach for solving MOO problems. Different from the traditional methods, STIMULUS introduces a simple yet powerful recursive framework for updating stochastic gradient estimates to improve convergence performance with low sample complexity. In addition, we introduce an enhanced version of STIMULUS, termed STIMULUS-M, which incorporates a momentum term to further expedite convergence. We establish $O(1/T)$ convergence rates of the proposed methods for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex settings, where $T$ is the total number of iteration rounds. Additionally, we achieve the state-of-the-art $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ sample complexities for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln ({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings, where $\epsilon>0$ is a desired stationarity error. Moreover, to alleviate the periodic full gradient evaluation requirement in STIMULUS and STIMULUS-M, we further propose enhanced versions with adaptive batching called STIMULUS+/ STIMULUS-M+ and provide their theoretical analysis.

Summary:
The paper introduces FlightKooba, a new modeling and control framework that combines the Koopman theory, the HIPPO method, and state space equations from cybernetics to address the challenges in flight trajectory prediction (FTP). FlightKooba directly constructs Koopman operators from data, enhancing interpretability and reducing the number of trainable parameters. Experimental results show improved time and memory efficiency, with training time comparable to existing modules and a significant reduction in memory consumption. The framework offers a fast computation method for Koopman operators, advancing the field of time series forecasting and control. Overall, FlightKooba proves to be a superior modeling method for FTP tasks, showcasing its potential for efficient and effective trajectory predictions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction (FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive, resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module, thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series forecasting and control.

Summary:
The paper introduces an intelligent framework that combines adaptive keyframe extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning to optimize the quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality interactions. A novel QoE metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, considering perceptual sensitivity, attention priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy. The QoE optimization problem is addressed as a mixed integer programming task, optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth allocation, and computational resources. The proposed Partial State Causal Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG) method integrates causal influence detection to improve training efficiency by considering how QoE is influenced by different actions. Experimental results using the CMU Motion Capture Database show that the framework reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains fairness, outperforming benchmark methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The optimization of quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality (VR) interactions demands a delicate balance between ultra-low latency, high-fidelity motion synchronization, and equitable resource allocation. While adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth, CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy. The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming (MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.

<div> Keywords: machine unlearning, neural networks, privacy regulations, convolutional kernel regularization, membership inference attack risks<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel class-aware soft pruning framework for efficiently achieving rapid and precise forgetting in machine unlearning tasks. By leveraging orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization, the method effectively removes class-specific knowledge from pretrained neural networks. The framework enforces orthogonality constraints during training to disentangle feature representations and identify class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets demonstrate stable pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes, and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. The approach substantially reduces membership inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude compared to existing methods, making it a practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) scenarios.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove class-specific knowledge from pretrained neural networks to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR. Existing methods typically face a trade-off between unlearning speed and preservation of predictive accuracy, often incurring either high computational overhead or significant performance degradation on retained classes. In this paper, we propose a novel class-aware soft pruning framework leveraging orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization to achieve rapid and precise forgetting with millisecond-level response times. By enforcing orthogonality constraints during training, our method decorrelates convolutional filters and disentangles feature representations, while efficiently identifying class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Extensive evaluations across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate stable pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes, and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet confirm that our approach substantially reduces membership inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides an efficient, practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) scenarios.

<div> knowledge distillation, generative semantic communication, AI-generated content, edge computing, wireless transmission

Summary:
DeKA-g is a novel algorithm proposed for generative semantic communication (GSC) systems to address the challenges of aligning knowledge between cloud-based generative AI (GAI) and edge devices. The algorithm utilizes distillation of generation knowledge into low-rank matrices, enhancing alignment between edge-generated and cloud-generated content. DeKA-g introduces two methods: metaword-aided knowledge distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). MAKD optimizes knowledge distillation efficiency using a metaword, while VGSA enables effective adaptation to varying compression rates and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges. Simulation results show a 44% improvement in alignment between edge and cloud-generated images, 116% higher efficiency in adapting to compression rates, and a 28% performance enhancement in low-SNR conditions. This algorithm provides a promising solution for efficient communication of AI-generated content from cloud to edge devices. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks. Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD, an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%. Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.

Summary:
The paper discusses the application of deep neural network models (DNN) in forecasting electricity prices in complex markets. Traditional econometric methods are compared to DNN models, which are found to offer greater predictive power. To better understand the factors influencing price dynamics, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods such as SHAP and Gradient are used. The study focuses on five electricity markets and introduces the concept of SSHAP values and SSHAP lines to enhance model interpretation. By analyzing the behavior and contributions of various features through visual techniques like heatmaps, the researchers aim to gain a deeper understanding of how different electricity markets operate. Ultimately, the combination of DNN forecasting and XAI interpretation sheds light on the intricate interactions and dependencies within electricity markets. <div>

Abstract: Electricity markets are highly complex, involving lots of interactions and complex dependencies that make it hard to understand the inner workings of the market and what is driving prices. Econometric methods have been developed for this, white-box models, however, they are not as powerful as deep neural network models (DNN). In this paper, we use a DNN to forecast the price and then use XAI methods to understand the factors driving the price dynamics in the market. The objective is to increase our understanding of how different electricity markets work. To do that, we apply explainable methods such as SHAP and Gradient, combined with visual techniques like heatmaps (saliency maps) to analyse the behaviour and contributions of various features across five electricity markets. We introduce the novel concepts of SSHAP values and SSHAP lines to enhance the complex representation of high-dimensional tabular models.

Summary: 
<br />
- Neural Networks are highly accurate but can make errors, especially in critical domains like medical diagnosis. 
- The uncertainty over neural network decisions is important to detect and mitigate errors.
- A new post-hoc framework is introduced to measure decision uncertainty based on retrieved training cases with similar activation vectors.
- Two new metrics, Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers.
- The proposed approach was evaluated on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, showing improved uncertainty estimation in challenging classification tasks compared to softmax-based confidence. <div>
arXiv:2506.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Networks have high accuracy in solving problems where it is difficult to detect patterns or create a logical model. However, these algorithms sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation, especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based confidence.

Abstract: Bearing faults in rotating machinery can lead to significant operational disruptions and maintenance costs. Modern methods for bearing fault diagnosis rely heavily on vibration analysis and machine learning techniques, which often require extensive labeled data and may not adapt well to dynamic environments. This study explores the feasibility of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), for bearing fault classification tasks in machine condition monitoring to enhance the accuracy and adaptability of bearing fault diagnosis. The results demonstrate that while RL models developed in this study can match the performance of traditional supervised learning models under controlled conditions, they excel in adaptability when equipped with optimized reward structures. However, their computational demands highlight areas for further improvement. These findings demonstrate RL's potential to complement traditional methods, paving the way for adaptive diagnostic frameworks.

Summary: 
- This research compares autoregressive (AR) approaches with masked diffusion models (MDMs) in a decoder-only framework, aiming to provide a fair evaluation of the two paradigms.
- The study suggests that the standard Any-Order AR (AO-AR) objective may benefit from refinement, as some token permutations are less informative compared to the language's left-to-right structure.
- The investigation also explores architectural influences in MDMs, showing that decoder-only MDMs can achieve significant generation speedups while maintaining comparable perplexity with temperature annealing.
- Decoder-only MDMs model a larger conditional probability space compared to encoder-only MDMs, highlighting trade-offs in model design.
- Overall, this work decouples architectural influences from core paradigm differences, offering insights for future language model design.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR) approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space, decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

<div> Keywords: interpretable machine learning, group importance, Generalized Additive Models, multimodal datasets, healthcare

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach to assess the importance of groups of features in Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The importance of joint signals from related features is often overlooked but can provide critical insights, especially in datasets with natural groupings of features. The method presented is efficient, allows posthoc definition of groups, accommodates overlapping groups, and remains relevant in high-dimensional settings. The approach parallels explained variation in statistics. Synthetic experiments demonstrate the behavior of group importance across different data scenarios. Case studies on identifying depressive symptoms in a neuroscience dataset and studying social determinants of health after total hip arthroplasty show that analyzing group importance offers a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of medical issues compared to analyzing individual features. Overall, considering the joint signal of related features can provide valuable insights in interpreting machine learning models, especially in healthcare applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While analyzing the importance of features has become ubiquitous in interpretable machine learning, the joint signal from a group of related features is sometimes overlooked or inadvertently excluded. Neglecting the joint signal could bypass a critical insight: in many instances, the most significant predictors are not isolated features, but rather the combined effect of groups of features. This can be especially problematic for datasets that contain natural groupings of features, including multimodal datasets. This paper introduces a novel approach to determine the importance of a group of features for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) that is efficient, requires no model retraining, allows defining groups posthoc, permits overlapping groups, and remains meaningful in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, this definition offers a parallel with explained variation in statistics. We showcase properties of our method on three synthetic experiments that illustrate the behavior of group importance across various data regimes. We then demonstrate the importance of groups of features in identifying depressive symptoms from a multimodal neuroscience dataset, and study the importance of social determinants of health after total hip arthroplasty. These two case studies reveal that analyzing group importance offers a more accurate, holistic view of the medical issues compared to a single-feature analysis.

Abstract: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering, starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy, significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a `topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex datasets.

Summary: 
Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED) introduces a novel framework for Unsupervised Environment Design (UED). By incorporating the transition prediction error and co-learnability into regret approximation, TRACED aims to improve the generalization of deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TRACED outperforms strong baselines in zero-shot generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring fewer environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the transition prediction error in driving rapid complexity ramp-up and the additional gains provided by co-learnability when paired with the transition prediction error. These results showcase how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can significantly enhance sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

<div> eye-tracking measurements, saccades, fixations, spatio-temporal dynamics, probabilistic model

Summary:
A new probabilistic model of reading behavior is proposed in this paper, focusing on the spatio-temporal dynamics of fixations and saccades during reading. The model utilizes a marked spatio-temporal point process to capture where and when fixations occur, and a Hawkes process to model saccades and their influence on subsequent fixations. The duration of fixation events is modeled using fixation-specific predictors convolved over time. Empirical results show that the Hawkes process model offers a better fit to human saccades compared to baseline models. Surprisingly, incorporating contextual surprisal as a predictor has only a minimal impact on the model's predictive accuracy for fixation durations, indicating potential limitations of surprisal theory in explaining fine-grained eye movements. <div>
arXiv:2506.19999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process, that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain fine-grained eye movements.

<br />Summary: <br />
Neuromorphic computing presents an energy-efficient option for real-time time-series processing, offering an alternative to traditional deep learning accelerators. A wireless split computing architecture utilizing resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons is explored in this study to process streaming signals with rich spectral features. These RF neurons resonate at tunable frequencies, extracting time-localized spectral features directly from time-domain signals without needing costly spectral preprocessing. This approach results in significant energy savings in computation and transmission. The proposed RF-SNN architecture, assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike transmission, is evaluated for audio and modulation classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs while reducing spike rates and total energy consumption during inference and communication. <div>

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and total energy consumption during inference and communication.

Abstract: Client heterogeneity poses significant challenges to the performance of Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach leveraging deep unfolding, which enables clients to autonomously optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rates and regularization factors, based on their specific training behavior. This dynamic adaptation mitigates overfitting and ensures robust optimization in highly heterogeneous environments where standard aggregation methods often fail. Our framework achieves approximately 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods, which typically yield around 55% accuracy, as demonstrated through real-time training on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit Aer simulators. By developing self adaptive fine tuning, the proposed method proves particularly effective in critical applications such as gene expression analysis and cancer detection, enhancing diagnostic precision and predictive modeling within quantum systems. Our results are attributed to convergence-aware, learnable optimization steps intrinsic to the deep unfolded framework, which maintains the generalization. Hence, this study addresses the core limitations of conventional QFL, streamlining its applicability to any complex challenges such as healthcare and genomic research.

Abstract: Time series imputation models have traditionally been developed using complete datasets with artificial masking patterns to simulate missing values. However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex, heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly less inference time.

<div> diffusion models, probabilistic forecasting, rolling diffusion frameworks, Elucidated Diffusion Models, high-dimensional chaotic systems <br />
Summary: <br />Diffusion models are commonly used for probabilistic forecasting in high-dimensional chaotic systems, but traditional approaches struggle with modeling complex temporal dependencies and escalating uncertainty. The Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM) framework addresses this challenge by integrating a rolling forecast structure with advanced Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). Key contributions include a novel loss weighting scheme focusing on mid-range forecast horizons, efficient initialization using pre-trained EDM, and a hybrid sequence architecture for robust feature extraction. Testing on 2D Navier-Stokes simulations and global weather forecasting shows ERDM outperforms baseline diffusion models. ERDM provides a flexible and powerful framework for generating sequences in scenarios where escalating uncertainty is crucial. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines, including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount.

<div> retraining, machine learning, biases, overparameterization, loss weighting  
Summary:  
In the study, the researchers investigate the regime of last layer retraining (LLR) in machine learning models. This regime involves unseen limited data and a proportionate model size, falling between underparameterization and separable overparameterization. The study demonstrates that loss weighting is still effective in the LLR regime but must consider the model's relative overparameterization. The research provides both theoretical analysis and practical evidence to support the effectiveness of loss weighting in this context. By acknowledging the unique characteristics of LLR settings, such as inseparable data and appropriately sized models, the study contributes to understanding how biases can be addressed in machine learning models trained with retraining data. <div>
arXiv:2506.20025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning models become more capable in discriminative tasks at scale, their ability to overcome biases introduced by training data has come under increasing scrutiny. Previous results suggest that there are two extremes of parameterization with very different behaviors: the population (underparameterized) setting where loss weighting is optimal and the separable overparameterized setting where loss weighting is ineffective at ensuring equal performance across classes. This work explores the regime of last layer retraining (LLR) in which the unseen limited (retraining) data is frequently inseparable and the model proportionately sized, falling between the two aforementioned extremes. We show, in theory and practice, that loss weighting is still effective in this regime, but that these weights \emph{must} take into account the relative overparameterization of the model.

<div> Graph abstraction, multi-robot task allocation, genetic algorithm, graph neural network, disaster response<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a computational framework for generating diverse pools of courses of action (COAs) for operations involving multiple agents. The approach considers variations in agent capabilities and environmental conditions, aiming to optimize task distributions and overall compatibility of agent-task mappings. Utilizing a graph abstraction of the task space, a genetic algorithm is employed for task allocation among agents to maximize diversity within the COA pool. A graph neural network is trained to perform task sequencing, adapting completion rates based on task features. In simulated environments, the proposed approach outperforms random walk baselines, achieves small optimality gaps in task sequencing, and demonstrates efficient planning of multiple COAs for various agent-task scenarios with a manageable execution time. The framework provides a systematic method for generating diverse and adaptive COA pools in complex operational settings. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations.

Abstract: Machine learning providers commonly distribute global models to edge devices, which subsequently personalize these models using local data. However, issues such as copyright infringements, biases, or regulatory requirements may require the verifiable removal of certain data samples across all edge devices. Ensuring that edge devices correctly execute such unlearning operations is critical to maintaining integrity.
  In this work, we introduce a verification framework leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs, to confirm data unlearning on personalized edge-device models without compromising privacy. We have developed algorithms explicitly designed to facilitate unlearning operations that are compatible with efficient zk-SNARK proof generation, ensuring minimal computational and memory overhead suitable for constrained edge environments. Furthermore, our approach carefully preserves personalized enhancements on edge devices, maintaining model performance post-unlearning.
  Our results affirm the practicality and effectiveness of this verification framework, demonstrating verifiable unlearning with minimal degradation in personalization-induced performance improvements. Our methodology ensures verifiable, privacy-preserving, and effective machine unlearning across edge devices.

Summary: 

The article introduces the concept of exploring emergent concepts across transformer layers using the CLVQVAE framework. It addresses the challenge of information mixing and duplication within large language models by mapping representations and collapsing duplicated features into compact, interpretable concept vectors. The framework combines top-k temperature-based sampling and EMA codebook updates for controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while maintaining diversity. Additionally, scaled-spherical k-means++ is used for codebook initialization, clustering based on directional similarity in word embedding space. This approach enhances the interpretability and semantic alignment of neural representations across transformer layers. <div>
arXiv:2506.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models. Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose \gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines top-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic structure in word embedding space.

<div> Keywords: imbalanced data streams, multi-class classification, Locality Sensitive Hashing, Random Hyperplane Projections, Dynamic Ensemble Diversification<br />
Summary: <br />
This study addresses the challenge of classifying imbalanced data streams, especially in multi-class scenarios. By integrating Locality Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework, a novel approach is proposed to handle dynamic imbalance ratios effectively. LSH-RHP is utilized for undersampling the majority classes, creating a balanced training set that enhances ensemble prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments on real-world and semi-synthetic datasets show that LSH-DynED outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods in Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness measures for multi-class imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The method demonstrates adaptability and robustness in large-scale, high-dimensional datasets with significant class imbalances. The study also provides guidance for future research in this area and offers the implementation code on GitHub for reproducibility. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.20041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of imbalanced data streams, which have unequal class distributions, is a key difficulty in machine learning, especially when dealing with multiple classes. While binary imbalanced data stream classification tasks have received considerable attention, only a few studies have focused on multi-class imbalanced data streams. Effectively managing the dynamic imbalance ratio is a key challenge in this domain. This study introduces a novel, robust, and resilient approach to address these challenges by integrating Locality Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first application of LSH-RHP for undersampling in the context of imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The proposed method undersamples the majority classes by utilizing LSH-RHP, provides a balanced training set, and improves the ensemble's prediction performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare LSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED outperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness measures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced non-stationary data streams. Notably, LSH-DynED performs well in large-scale, high-dimensional datasets with considerable class imbalances and demonstrates adaptation and robustness in real-world circumstances. To motivate our design, we review existing methods for imbalanced data streams, outline key challenges, and offer guidance for future work. For the reproducibility of our results, we have made our implementation available on GitHub.

Summary: <br />
This article introduces a novel method for quantifying the uncertainty of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in healthcare applications. Current methods such as Bayesian and ensemble approaches are computationally expensive. The proposed method, based on knowledge distillation, utilizes self-distillation where the same network acts as both teacher and student models, eliminating the need to train multiple networks independently. An uncertainty metric is developed to capture the diverse nature of the network by assigning varying weights to each GNN classifier. Experimental evaluations on MIMIC-IV and Enzymes datasets show that the method effectively captures predictive uncertainty with performance comparable to MC Dropout and ensemble methods. The proposed approach demonstrates promising results in distinguishing out-of-distribution data. The code for the method is publicly available for further research and application. <div>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in the healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs' uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/tailabTMU/UQ_GNN.

Abstract: We investigate the use of randomly generated data for the sake of pre-training a model. We justify this approach theoretically from the perspective of algorithmic complexity, building on recent research that shows that sequence models can be trained to approximate Solomonoff induction. We derive similar, but complementary theoretical results. We show empirically that synthetically generated data can be used to pre-train a model before the data is seen. We replicate earlier results that models trained this way show zero-shot in-context learning across a variety of datasets, and that this performance improves with scale. We extend earlier results to real-world data, and show that finetuning a model after pre-training offers faster convergence and better generalization.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Developing effective instruction-following policies in reinforcement learning remains challenging due to the reliance on extensive human-labeled instruction datasets and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate open-ended instructions retrospectively from previously collected agent trajectories. Our core idea is to employ LLMs to relabel unsuccessful trajectories by identifying meaningful subtasks the agent has implicitly accomplished, thereby enriching the agent's training data and substantially alleviating reliance on human annotations. Through this open-ended instruction relabeling, we efficiently learn a unified instruction-following policy capable of handling diverse tasks within a single policy. We empirically evaluate our proposed method in the challenging Craftax environment, demonstrating clear improvements in sample efficiency, instruction coverage, and overall policy performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of utilizing LLM-guided open-ended instruction relabeling to enhance instruction-following reinforcement learning.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization method for computational phenotyping in the context of ulcerative colitis (UC). By integrating Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) with static features and temporal labs, the model successfully predicts medication persistence in UC patients. The deep learning framework of the model allows for flexibility and ease of training, particularly addressing the high sparsity of PRO data. Results indicate strong predictive performance up to 20 months in advance, with interpretable phenotypes comprising both static and temporal features. This approach demonstrates the utility of low-rank matrix and tensor-based methods in handling missing PRO data and extracting valuable information for medication persistence prediction in UC patients. <div>

Abstract: Phenotyping is the process of distinguishing groups of patients to identify different types of disease progression. A recent trend employs low-rank matrix and tensor factorization methods for their capability of dealing with multi-modal, heterogeneous, and missing data. Symptom quantification is crucial for understanding patient experiences in inflammatory bowel disease, especially in conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC). However, patient-reported symptoms are typically noisy, subjective, and significantly more sparse than other data types. For this reason, they are usually not included in phenotyping and other machine learning methods. This paper explores the application of computational phenotyping to leverage Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a novel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) method, which integrates temporal PROs and temporal labs with static features to predict medication persistence in ulcerative colitis. This is the first tensor-based method that is both supervised and coupled, it is the first application to the UC domain, and the first application to PROs. We use a deep learning framework that makes the model flexible and easy to train. The proposed method allows us to handle the large amount of missing data in the PROs. The best model predicts changes in medication 8 and 20 months in the future with AUCs of 0.853 and 0.803 on the test set respectively. We derive interpretable phenotypes consisting of static features and temporal features (including their temporal patterns). We show that low-rank matrix and tensor based phenotyping can be successfully applied to the UC domain and to highly missing PRO data. We identify phenotypes useful to predict medication persistence - these phenotypes include several symptom variables, showing that PROs contain relevant infromation that is usually discarded.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) has become a crucial element of modern industrial practice. PdM plays a significant role in operational dependability and cost management by decreasing unforeseen downtime and optimizing asset life cycle management. Machine learning and deep learning have enabled more precise forecasts of equipment failure and remaining useful life (RUL). Although many studies have been conducted on PdM, there has not yet been a standalone comparative study between regression- and classification-based approaches. In this review, we look across a range of PdM methodologies, while focusing more strongly on the comparative use of classification and regression methods in prognostics. While regression-based methods typically provide estimates of RUL, classification-based methods present a forecast of the probability of failure across defined time intervals. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent literature, we highlight key advancements, challenges-such as data imbalance and high-dimensional feature spaces-and emerging trends, including hybrid approaches and AI-enabled prognostic systems. This review aims to provide researchers and practitioners with an awareness of the strengths and compromises of various PdM methods and to help identify future research and build more robust, directed adaptive maintenance systems. Future work may include a systematic review of practical aspects such as public datasets, benchmarking platforms, and open-source tools to support the advancement of PdM research.

Summary: <br />
AI inference at the edge is becoming more common, but edge environments face challenges like power constraints and failures. Conventional resilience methods compromise latency or accuracy. The Multi-Level Ensemble Learning (MEL) framework proposed in this paper trains multiple lightweight backup models to collaborate and refine each other. It formulates the approach as a multi-objective optimization problem, promoting diversity among models while maintaining individual performance. Empirical evaluations across datasets show that MEL achieves comparable performance to original architectures, providing fault tolerance and deployment flexibility. A 40% ensemble model achieves similar performance to the original while preserving 95.6% of ensemble accuracy in case of failures when using MEL. <div>

Abstract: AI inference at the edge is becoming increasingly common for low-latency services. However, edge environments are power- and resource-constrained, and susceptible to failures. Conventional failure resilience approaches, such as cloud failover or compressed backups, often compromise latency or accuracy, limiting their effectiveness for critical edge inference services. In this paper, we propose Multi-Level Ensemble Learning (MEL), a new framework for resilient edge inference that simultaneously trains multiple lightweight backup models capable of operating collaboratively, refining each other when multiple servers are available, and independently under failures while maintaining good accuracy. Specifically, we formulate our approach as a multi-objective optimization problem with a loss formulation that inherently encourages diversity among individual models to promote mutually refining representations, while ensuring each model maintains good standalone performance. Empirical evaluations across vision, language, and audio datasets show that MEL provides performance comparable to original architectures while also providing fault tolerance and deployment flexibility across edge platforms. Our results show that our ensemble model, sized at 40\% of the original model, achieves similar performance, while preserving 95.6\% of ensemble accuracy in the case of failures when trained using MEL.

Summary: 
This study focuses on utilizing a pretrained, highly-multimodal earth-observation model to generate large-scale spatially complete maps of Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) to assess wildfire risk. Ground-based LFMC samples are limited and costly, so the research aims to improve upon previous methods using randomly initialized models. The approach shows a 20% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and creates LFMC maps across the United States. The automated pipeline developed enables quick generation of LFMC maps in regions affected by wildfires, such as Eaton and Palisades. This advancement is essential in monitoring critical wildfire risk factors globally with high resolution and low latency, aiding in both wildfire research and operational response. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity and severity at an alarming rate. Recent advances in AI and publicly available satellite data enable monitoring critical wildfire risk factors globally, at high resolution and low latency. Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical wildfire risk factor and is valuable for both wildfire research and operational response. However, ground-based LFMC samples are both labor intensive and costly to acquire, resulting in sparse and infrequent updates. In this work, we explore the use of a pretrained, highly-multimodal earth-observation model for generating large-scale spatially complete (wall-to-wall) LFMC maps. Our approach achieves significant improvements over previous methods using randomly initialized models (20 reduction in RMSE). We provide an automated pipeline that enables rapid generation of these LFMC maps across the United States, and demonstrate its effectiveness in two regions recently impacted by wildfire (Eaton and Palisades).

Summary:
The article discusses a new method for causal discovery in deterministic LTI-DAE systems, addressing systems with feedback control or conservation laws. The proposed partition of variables (PoV) method utilizes dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA) to identify causal drivers efficiently. It can handle pure dynamical systems as well, determining the number of algebraic and dynamical relations to identify causal subsets. By admissibly partitioning the constraint matrix based on its condition number, PoV can pinpoint causal drivers up to a minimal subset. Case studies demonstrate the method's effectiveness, showcasing its applicability in practical scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations. However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables (PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations ($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix. Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework for discovering causal structure in partial differential equations (PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks and counterfactual perturbations. Unlike traditional methods, this approach quantifies operator-level necessity through functional interventions on the dynamics. It introduces causal sensitivity indices and structural deviation metrics to evaluate differential operators within neural surrogates. The framework guarantees exact recovery of causal operator support under certain conditions, with identifiable residual bounds. Validation on synthetic and real-world datasets covering climate dynamics, tumor diffusion, and ocean flows demonstrate the method's effectiveness, even under noise, redundancy, and data scarcity. It outperforms standard methods in structural fidelity, positioning causal PDE discovery as an interpretable inference task grounded in structural causal models and variational residual analysis. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We develop a principled framework for discovering causal structure in partial differential equations (PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks and counterfactual perturbations. Unlike classical residual minimization or sparse regression methods, our approach quantifies operator-level necessity through functional interventions on the governing dynamics. We introduce causal sensitivity indices and structural deviation metrics to assess the influence of candidate differential operators within neural surrogates. Theoretically, we prove exact recovery of the causal operator support under restricted isometry or mutual coherence conditions, with residual bounds guaranteeing identifiability. Empirically, we validate the framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets across climate dynamics, tumor diffusion, and ocean flows. Our method consistently recovers governing operators even under noise, redundancy, and data scarcity, outperforming standard PINNs and DeepONets in structural fidelity. This work positions causal PDE discovery as a tractable and interpretable inference task grounded in structural causal models and variational residual analysis.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, sparsity, pruning, Optimal Brain Compression, LLaMA-2

Summary:
DuoGPT introduces a novel approach to addressing the high memory and compute costs associated with deploying Large Language Models (LLMs). By combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity, DuoGPT creates dual-sparse workloads that are both efficient and accurate. The framework extends the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) methodology with activation-aware calibration and utilizes output residuals from the dense model to maintain accuracy. Additionally, efficient GPU execution optimization allows for scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 demonstrate that DuoGPT surpasses state-of-the-art structured pruning methods by up to 9.17% in accuracy while achieving a 1.39$\times$ iso-speedup compared to the baseline dense model. This innovative approach opens up new possibilities for deploying high-performance LLMs in real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: DuoGPT introduces a unified framework for constructing dual-sparse workloads, combining weight pruning with activation sparsity. It extends the OBC methodology with activation-aware calibration and output residuals, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency for deploying billion-parameter LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but are difficult to deploy due to high memory and compute costs. While pruning reduces these demands, most methods ignore activation sparsity observed at runtime. We reinterpret activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity and propose DuoGPT, a unified framework that constructs dual-sparse (spMspV) workloads by combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity. To preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\times$ compared to the baseline dense model.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Anubis, a zero-shot attribution tool that addresses the problem of attributing code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). By framing attribution as a distribution testing problem, Anubis can assess the likelihood of code samples originating from a suspect model using both samples and density estimates from the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that Anubis achieves high AUROC scores (≥0.9) in distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and Stable-Code with just approximately 2000 samples. This approach overcomes the curse of dimensionality by leveraging the available access to samples and density estimates, leading to effective attribution of code derived from LLMs. <div>

Abstract: A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs). We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees. Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the LLM, a form of access commonly available.
  We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores ( $\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.

Summary: 
The study introduces the Affective Priming Score (APS) as a data-driven approach to identify and mitigate the impact of priming effects on physiological signals in affective computing data. By assigning a score to each data point, the APS quantifies the extent to which it is influenced by priming, leading to improved model robustness and reduced misclassification rates. The research conducted on the SEED and SEED-VII datasets demonstrates that using priming-free sequences in training models significantly reduces misclassification compared to using original data affected by priming. This innovative approach addresses the challenge of ambiguity in affective computing by focusing on the impact of priming on data itself, offering valuable insights for dataset design and collection in the field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective computing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point, quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train models with the same configuration using both the original data and priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing datasets.

Summary: <br />
Link prediction is a common problem in graph analysis, with applications in various fields. Current deep learning techniques for directed graphs focus on node similarities and neighborhood information. This study introduces a novel graph neural network framework that combines feature embedding with community information, resulting in enhanced performance for directed link prediction. The approach involves transforming input graphs into directed line graphs to enable nodes to aggregate more information during graph convolutions efficiently. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques when using different percentages of connected links as training data.

Abstract: Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data, respectively.

Summary:
Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning technique that addresses data privacy issues in industrial ML. Handling non-identical and independent distributed data poses a significant challenge in FL. Current solutions often prioritize either global model performance or personalized local models. The proposed Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD) framework leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate synthetic data, enabling bidirectional distillation between global and local models. By freezing local model parameters during GAN training, FedBKD facilitates knowledge interactions to enhance performance on both sides. Experimental results across four benchmarks demonstrate that FedBKD outperforms existing methods in various non-IID settings. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning (ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data. Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time. Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD). Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

Abstract: Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under challenging evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.

<div> MM, model multiplicity, ensembling, counterfactual explanations, argumentative ensembling<br />Summary:<br />Model multiplicity (MM) in machine learning leads to multiple equally performing models, causing challenges in providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs). To address this, the concept of recourse-aware ensembling (RAE) is introduced, emphasizing the consideration of individual model CEs alongside predictions for robustness. Six desirable properties are identified for solutions to RAE, with a focus on ensuring the validity of CEs under MM. A novel argumentative ensembling method is proposed, utilizing computational argumentation to resolve conflicts between models and CEs and incorporating preferences over models for customization. The method is theoretically analyzed with different argumentation semantics and empirically shown to satisfy desirable properties across eight instantiations, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling MM and providing reliable recourse recommendations. <div>
arXiv:2506.20260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs. Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e., the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)

arXiv:2506.20285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) addresses the challenges posed by non-IID data by training multiple group- or cluster-specific expert models. However, existing methods often overlook the shared information across clusters, which represents the generalizable knowledge valuable to all participants in the Federated Learning (FL) system. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel FL framework that distills a universal expert model from the knowledge of multiple clusters. This universal expert captures globally shared information across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client as the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL framework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each client, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert distillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of fine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared knowledge across clusters. Compared to traditional gradient-based aggregation methods, the distillation-based model aggregation introduces greater flexibility in handling model heterogeneity and reduces conflicts among cluster-specific experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method across various scenarios, highlighting its potential to advance the state of CFL by balancing personalized and shared knowledge more effectively.

Summary:
Transformers are utilized in decoding Quick Response (QR) codes, showcasing the learning of medium input-sensitive functions. The study focuses on the capability of Transformers to decode QR codes beyond conventional error-correction limits by understanding the embedded text structure. The transformers demonstrate successful generalization from English-rich training data to other languages and random strings. Interestingly, the Transformer-based QR decoder emphasizes data bits over error-correction bits, suggesting a unique decoding mechanism. This research highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in handling medium input-sensitive tasks such as QR code decoding.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard QR code readers.

<div> Keywords: Imitation learning, exploration, policy optimization, curiosity-driven, sample efficiency

Summary:
Imitation learning aims to mimic expert behavior but is challenging with limited demonstrations in complex state spaces. The proposed ILDE algorithm addresses this by incorporating double exploration: optimistic policy optimization using an exploration bonus to reward uncertainty and curiosity-driven exploration of deviation from expert trajectories. ILDE outperforms existing methods in sample efficiency and achieves beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations. The algorithm is theoretically justified as an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization approach with optimistic exploration, leading to regret growing sublinearly in episode count. Through empirical tests, ILDE demonstrates superior performance and provides a promising solution for learning policies effectively from limited demonstrations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover, it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration (ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and (2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.

This research demonstrates the potential of transfer learning in reshaping agricultural practices, improving crop health management, and supporting sustainable farming in rural environments.

Summary:
Dynamic graphs present challenges with evolving node features and changing network structures. Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) adapted Neural CDEs for graph domains, and now Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs reduce parameter count while maintaining representational power. This results in more efficient training and better generalization capabilities. Empirical experiments on simulated systems and real-world tasks demonstrate the advantages of this approach, showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Dynamic graphs exhibit complex temporal dynamics due to the interplay between evolving node features and changing network structures. Recently, Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Graph Neural CDEs) successfully adapted Neural CDEs from paths on Euclidean domains to paths on graph domains. Building on this foundation, we introduce Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs, which project Graph Neural CDEs onto permutation equivariant function spaces. This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks, showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.

It proposes an exact solution for small instances of the problem and examines heuristics like quality-first and fairness-first, as well as an adaptive variant. Real-world datasets are used to test these solutions, showing their effectiveness in providing fair bundle recommendations without compromising quality. The research addresses the need for balancing bundle fairness and quality in real-time scenarios, with a focus on serving users with relevant and compatible items in a fair and efficient manner.

Abstract: We address fairness in the context of sequential bundle recommendation, where users are served in turn with sets of relevant and compatible items. Motivated by real-world scenarios, we formalize producer-fairness, that seeks to achieve desired exposure of different item groups across users in a recommendation session. Our formulation combines naturally with building high quality bundles. Our problem is solved in real time as users arrive. We propose an exact solution that caters to small instances of our problem. We then examine two heuristics, quality-first and fairness-first, and an adaptive variant that determines on-the-fly the right balance between bundle fairness and quality. Our experiments on three real-world datasets underscore the strengths and limitations of each solution and demonstrate their efficacy in providing fair bundle recommendations without compromising bundle quality.

Summary:
- The article proposes a new approach to Granger Causality estimation using Deep Neural Networks.
- Traditional methods like VAR models have limitations, prompting the need for alternative approaches.
- Deep learning models can potentially learn the true Granger causal structure from data without explicit variable selection.
- The proposed method involves comparing model uncertainty or residuals to uncover the learned GC structure.
- Input layer dropout is explored to assess its impact on the neural network's ability to learn Granger causality.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) offers an elegant statistical framework to study the association between multivariate time series data. Linear Vector Autoregressive models (VAR) though have nice interpretation properties but have limited practical application due to underlying assumptions on the kind of associations that can be captured by these models. Numerous attempts have already been made in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task of GC estimation. These methods however treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for approaching GC. We present this idea that GC is essentially linked with prediction and if a deep learning model is used to model the time series collectively or jointly, a well regularized model may learn the true granger causal structure from the data, given that there is enough training data. We propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a neural network to learn granger causality from the data. We show that a well regularized model infact can learn the true GC structure from the data without explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select variables or perform sparse regression.

<div> Keywords: large language models, SVD compression, importance protection, data whitening, model performance

Summary:
The paper introduces a dual-level importance protection mechanism called DipSVD to enhance SVD-based compression methods for large language models. It focuses on preserving critical components within weight matrices by implementing local and global importance protection strategies. Local importance protection involves preserving crucial singular vectors using channel-weighted data whitening, while global importance protection assigns less important layers a higher compression burden to minimize the impact on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches, particularly at high compression ratios, resulting in superior model performance across multiple benchmarks. This method addresses the limitations of previous SVD compression methods by prioritizing the protection of critical components within the compressed models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix, which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model compression ratios.

Abstract: Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation model with state-of-the-art clinical performance. The code is available at https://github.com/IBM/multi-variate-parallel-transformer. The SWEC iEEG dataset is available at https://mb-neuro.medical-blocks.ch/public_access/databases/ieeg/swec_ieeg.

<div> Feature selection, Trajectory analysis, Taxonomy, Predictive performance, Interpretability  
Summary:<br /><br />
The paper discusses the importance of trajectory analysis in understanding object movement patterns and predicting future movements. With the increase in data collection, a high-dimensional feature explosion problem arises, impacting machine learning model accuracy. To address this, a taxonomy-based feature selection method categorizing features into geometric and kinematic groups was introduced. The approach significantly reduces feature selection time and offers insights into dataset sensitivity. Results showed the taxonomy-based method consistently outperformed traditional methods, enhancing interpretability and reducing computational complexity. This study contributes to explainable artificial intelligence and provides a framework for researchers and practitioners dealing with trajectory datasets.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also of paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves through space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially, resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus, the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We present LaplaceGNN, a novel self-supervised graph learning framework that bypasses the need for negative sampling by leveraging spectral bootstrapping techniques. Our method integrates Laplacian-based signals into the learning process, allowing the model to effectively capture rich structural representations without relying on contrastive objectives or handcrafted augmentations. By focusing on positive alignment, LaplaceGNN achieves linear scaling while offering a simpler, more efficient, self-supervised alternative for graph neural networks, applicable across diverse domains. Our contributions are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and robustness. Our extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that LaplaceGNN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised graph methods, offering a promising direction for efficiently learning expressive graph representations.

Abstract: Satellite remote sensing (RS) enables a wide array of downstream Earth observation (EO) applications, including climate modeling, carbon accounting, and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. We present TESSERA, a novel Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) that uses Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to generate global, robust representations at 10m scale from pixel-level satellite time series data. TESSERA combines information from only optical and SAR data streams using two parallel Transformer-based encoders: one dedicated to Sentinel-1 SAR polarizations and another to Sentinel-2 MSI data (10 selected spectral bands) to create representations that are then fused using a multilayer perceptron (MLP), resulting in a global representation map covering the years 2017 to 2024. Our precomputed representations set a new state-of-the-art performance benchmark and our open-source approach democratizes access to high-performance, high-resolution representations. We benchmark the performance of TESSERA in five diverse tasks, comparing our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models. Our results show that TESSERA outperforms both traditional RS baselines and the leading geospatial foundation models in these diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous, resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models, maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices, where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of overhead.

<title>Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning for the Future under Non-Stationarity</title>

Abstract: We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture \textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example, seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE. Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data. Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under non-stationarity for various experimental setups.

<title>Tackling Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning through Knowledge Distillation with Inequitable Aggregation</title>

arXiv:2506.20431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning aims to train a global model in a distributed environment that is close to the performance of centralized training. However, issues such as client label skew, data quantity skew, and other heterogeneity problems severely degrade the model's performance. Most existing methods overlook the scenario where only a small portion of clients participate in training within a large-scale client setting, whereas our experiments show that this scenario presents a more challenging federated learning task. Therefore, we propose a Knowledge Distillation with teacher-student Inequitable Aggregation (KDIA) strategy tailored to address the federated learning setting mentioned above, which can effectively leverage knowledge from all clients. In KDIA, the student model is the average aggregation of the participating clients, while the teacher model is formed by a weighted aggregation of all clients based on three frequencies: participation intervals, participation counts, and data volume proportions. During local training, self-knowledge distillation is performed. Additionally, we utilize a generator trained on the server to generate approximately independent and identically distributed (IID) data features locally for auxiliary training. We conduct extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10 datasets and various heterogeneous settings to evaluate KDIA. The results show that KDIA can achieve better accuracy with fewer rounds of training, and the improvement is more significant under severe heterogeneity.

Abstract: Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient way to learn surrogate neural solvers of PDEs by embedding the physical model in the loss function and minimizing its residuals using automatic differentiation at so-called collocation points. Originally uniformly sampled, the choice of the latter has been the subject of recent advances leading to adaptive sampling refinements. In this paper, we propose a new quadrature method for approximating definite integrals based on the hessian of the considered function, and that we leverage to guide the selection of the collocation points during the training process of PINNs.

Abstract: A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data classification is how to determine the ideal number of demonstrations in the prompt. This work addresses this challenge by presenting an algorithm to automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10. Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by self-influence alone.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning, and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from different data types), alignment methods (to match information across modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models). Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas: computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal with real-world complexity.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative Machine Learning framework for training models without collecting data in a centralized location. It has seen application across various disciplines, from helping medical diagnoses in hospitals to detecting fraud in financial transactions. In this paper, we focus on improving the local training process through hardware usage optimization. While participants in a federation might share the hardware they are training on, since there is no information exchange between them, their training process can be hindered by an improper training configuration. Taking advantage of the parallel processing inherent to Federated Learning, we use a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes for the best training settings across all participants. Our results show that against default parameter settings, our method improves convergence speed while staying nearly on par with the case where local parameters are optimized.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm which allows participants to collectively train a model while training data remains private. This paradigm is especially beneficial for sectors like finance, where data privacy, security and model performance are paramount. FL has been extensively studied in the years following its introduction, leading to, among others, better performing collaboration techniques, ways to defend against other clients trying to attack the model, and contribution assessment methods. An important element in for-profit Federated Learning is the development of incentive methods to determine the allocation and distribution of rewards for participants. While numerous methods for allocation have been proposed and thoroughly explored, distribution frameworks remain relatively understudied. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which introduces client-specific tokens as investment vehicles within the FL ecosystem. Our framework aims to address the limitations of existing incentive schemes by leveraging a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and automated market makers (AMMs) to create a more flexible and scalable reward distribution system for participants, and a mechanism for third parties to invest in the federation learning process.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with $r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$ emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward, the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals, off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA) method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

<title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning Regulated by Finite Element Analysis for Simulation Acceleration of Laser Powder Bed Fusion</title>

Abstract: Efficient simulation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is crucial for process prediction due to the lasting issue of high computation cost using traditional numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA). This study presents an efficient modeling framework termed FEA-Regulated Physics-Informed Neural Network (FEA-PINN) to accelerate the thermal field prediction in a LPBF process while maintaining the FEA accuracy. A novel dynamic material updating strategy is developed to capture the dynamic phase change of powder-liquid-solid in the PINN model. The PINN model incorporates temperature-dependent material properties and phase change behavior using the apparent heat capacity method. While the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy with a small training data and enables generalization of new process parameters via transfer learning, it faces the challenge of high computation cost in time-dependent problems due to the residual accumulation. To overcome this issue, the FEA-PINN framework integrates corrective FEA simulations during inference to enforce physical consistency and reduce error drift. A comparative analysis shows that FEA-PINN achieves equivalent accuracy to FEA while significantly reducing computational cost. The framework has been validated using the benchmark FEA data and demonstrated through single-track scanning in LPBF.

Abstract: This paper is about optimally controlling skill-based queueing systems such as data centers, cloud computing networks, and service systems. By means of a case study using a real-world data set, we investigate the practical implementation of a recently developed reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal customer routing. Our experiments show that the algorithm efficiently learns and adapts to changing environments and outperforms static benchmark policies, indicating its potential for live implementation. We also augment the real-world applicability of this algorithm by introducing a new heuristic routing rule to reduce delays. Moreover, we show that the algorithm can optimize for multiple objectives: next to payoff maximization, secondary objectives such as server load fairness and customer waiting time reduction can be incorporated. Tuning parameters are used for balancing inherent performance trade--offs. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity to estimation errors and parameter tuning, providing valuable insights for implementing adaptive routing algorithms in complex real-world queueing systems.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is an important problem across various fields such as healthcare, financial services, manufacturing or physics detector monitoring. Accurately identifying when unexpected errors or faults occur is essential, yet challenging, due to the unknown nature of anomalies and the complex interdependencies between time series dimensions. In this paper, we investigate transformer-based approaches for time series anomaly detection, focusing on the recently proposed iTransformer architecture. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) we explore the application of the iTransformer to time series anomaly detection, and analyse the influence of key parameters such as window size, step size, and model dimensions on performance; (ii) we examine methods for extracting anomaly labels from multidimensional anomaly scores and discuss appropriate evaluation metrics for such labels; (iii) we study the impact of anomalous data present during training and assess the effectiveness of alternative loss functions in mitigating their influence; and (iv) we present a comprehensive comparison of several transformer-based models across a diverse set of datasets for time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored.
  In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones consistently demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms.
  Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Demonstrating its model-agnostic design, this approach not only provided meaningful insights into GT and MPNN backbones. It also shows promise for broader applicability to DG problems beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.

Abstract: The most popular graph indices for vector search use principles from computational geometry to build the graph. Hence, their formal graph navigability guarantees are only valid in Euclidean space. In this work, we show that machine learning can be used to build graph indices for vector search in metric and non-metric vector spaces (e.g., for inner product similarity). From this novel perspective, we introduce the Support Vector Graph (SVG), a new type of graph index that leverages kernel methods to establish the graph connectivity and that comes with formal navigability guarantees valid in metric and non-metric vector spaces. In addition, we interpret the most popular graph indices, including HNSW and DiskANN, as particular specializations of SVG and show that new indices can be derived from the principles behind this specialization. Finally, we propose SVG-L0 that incorporates an $\ell_0$ sparsity constraint into the SVG kernel method to build graphs with a bounded out-degree. This yields a principled way of implementing this practical requirement, in contrast to the traditional heuristic of simply truncating the out edges of each node. Additionally, we show that SVG-L0 has a self-tuning property that avoids the heuristic of using a set of candidates to find the out-edges of each node and that keeps its computational complexity in check.

Abstract: Hamiltonian systems describe a broad class of dynamical systems governed by Hamiltonian functions, which encode the total energy and dictate the evolution of the system. Data-driven approaches, such as symbolic regression and neural network-based methods, provide a means to learn the governing equations of dynamical systems directly from observational data of Hamiltonian systems. However, these methods often struggle to accurately capture complex Hamiltonian functions while preserving energy conservation. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Finite Expression Method for learning Hamiltonian Systems (H-FEX), a symbolic learning method that introduces novel interaction nodes designed to capture intricate interaction terms effectively. Our experiments, including those on highly stiff dynamical systems, demonstrate that H-FEX can recover Hamiltonian functions of complex systems that accurately capture system dynamics and preserve energy over long time horizons. These findings highlight the potential of H-FEX as a powerful framework for discovering closed-form expressions of complex dynamical systems.

<title>Lost in Retraining: Roaming the Parameter Space of Exponential Families Under Closed-Loop Learning</title>

Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves. We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we show that this outcome may be prevented by polluting the data with an infinitesimal fraction of data points generated from a fixed model, by relying on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation. Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics is not reparametrisation invariant.

<title>PLoP: Precise LoRA Placement for Efficient Finetuning of Large Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used finetuning method for large models. Its small memory footprint allows practitioners to adapt large models to specific tasks at a fraction of the cost of full finetuning. Different modifications have been proposed to enhance its efficiency by, for example, setting the learning rate, the rank, and the initialization. Another improvement axis is adapter placement strategy: when using LoRA, practitioners usually pick module types to adapt with LoRA, such as Query and Key modules. Few works have studied the problem of adapter placement, with nonconclusive results: original LoRA paper suggested placing adapters in attention modules, while other works suggested placing them in the MLP modules. Through an intuitive theoretical analysis, we introduce PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), a lightweight method that allows automatic identification of module types where LoRA adapters should be placed, given a pretrained model and a finetuning task. We demonstrate that PLoP consistently outperforms, and in the worst case competes, with commonly used placement strategies through comprehensive experiments on supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning.

Abstract: As privacy protection gains increasing importance, more models are being trained on edge devices and subsequently merged into the central server through Federated Learning (FL). However, current research overlooks the impact of network topology, physical distance, and data heterogeneity on edge devices, leading to issues such as increased latency and degraded model performance. To address these issues, we propose a new federated learning scheme on edge devices that called Federated Learning with Encrypted Data Sharing(FedEDS). FedEDS uses the client model and the model's stochastic layer to train the data encryptor. The data encryptor generates encrypted data and shares it with other clients. The client uses the corresponding client's stochastic layer and encrypted data to train and adjust the local model. FedEDS uses the client's local private data and encrypted shared data from other clients to train the model. This approach accelerates the convergence speed of federated learning training and mitigates the negative impact of data heterogeneity, making it suitable for application services deployed on edge devices requiring rapid convergence. Experiments results show the efficacy of FedEDS in promoting model performance.

<title>Mastering Multiple-Expert Routing: Realizable $H$-Consistency and Strong Guarantees for Learning to Defer</title>

Abstract: The problem of learning to defer with multiple experts consists of optimally assigning input instances to experts, balancing the trade-off between their accuracy and computational cost. This is a critical challenge in natural language generation, but also in other fields such as image processing, and medical diagnostics. Recent studies have proposed surrogate loss functions to optimize deferral, but challenges remain in ensuring their consistency properties. This paper introduces novel surrogate loss functions and efficient algorithms with strong theoretical learning guarantees. We address open questions regarding realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and Bayes-consistency for both single-stage (jointly learning predictor and deferral function) and two-stage (learning only the deferral function with a fixed expert) learning scenarios. For single-stage deferral, we introduce a family of new realizable $H$-consistent surrogate losses and further prove $H$-consistency for a selected member. For two-stage deferral, we derive new surrogate losses that achieve realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and Bayes-consistency for the two-expert scenario and, under natural assumptions, multiple-expert scenario. Additionally, we provide enhanced theoretical guarantees under low-noise assumptions for both scenarios. Finally, we report the results of experiments using our proposed surrogate losses, comparing their performance against existing baselines.

<title>Hear No Evil: Detecting Gradient Leakage by Malicious Servers in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent work has shown that gradient updates in federated learning (FL) can unintentionally reveal sensitive information about a client's local data. This risk becomes significantly greater when a malicious server manipulates the global model to provoke information-rich updates from clients. In this paper, we adopt a defender's perspective to provide the first comprehensive analysis of malicious gradient leakage attacks and the model manipulation techniques that enable them. Our investigation reveals a core trade-off: these attacks cannot be both highly effective in reconstructing private data and sufficiently stealthy to evade detection -- especially in realistic FL settings that incorporate common normalization techniques and federated averaging.
  Building on this insight, we argue that malicious gradient leakage attacks, while theoretically concerning, are inherently limited in practice and often detectable through basic monitoring. As a complementary contribution, we propose a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable client-side detection mechanism that flags suspicious model updates before local training begins, despite the fact that such detection may not be strictly necessary in realistic FL settings. This mechanism further underscores the feasibility of defending against these attacks with minimal overhead, offering a deployable safeguard for privacy-conscious federated learning systems.

Abstract: We establish the first finite-time information-theoretic lower bounds-and derive new policies that achieve them-for the total queue length in scheduling problems over stochastic processing networks with both adversarial and stochastic arrivals. Prior analyses of MaxWeight guarantee only stability and asymptotic optimality in heavy traffic; we prove that, at finite horizons, MaxWeight can incur strictly larger backlog by problem-dependent factors which we identify. Our main innovations are 1) a minimax framework that pinpoints the precise problem parameters governing any policy's finite-time performance; 2) an information-theoretic lower bound on total queue length; 3) fundamental limitation of MaxWeight that it is suboptimal in finite time; and 4) a new scheduling rule that minimizes the full Lyapunov drift-including its second-order term-thereby matching the lower bound under certain conditions, up to universal constants. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation on "drift-only" methods and points the way toward principled, non-asymptotic optimality in queueing control.

Abstract: Studying the peeling behaviour of adhesives on skin is vital for advancing biomedical applications such as medical adhesives and transdermal patches. Traditional methods like experimental testing and finite element method (FEM), though considered gold standards, are resource-intensive, computationally expensive and time-consuming, particularly when analysing a wide material parameter space. In this study, we present a neural network-based approach to predict the minimum peel force (F_min) required for adhesive detachment from skin tissue, limiting the need for repeated FEM simulations and significantly reducing the computational cost. Leveraging a dataset generated from FEM simulations of 90 degree peel test with varying adhesive and fracture mechanics parameters, our neural network model achieved high accuracy, validated through rigorous 5-fold cross-validation. The final architecture was able to predict a wide variety of skin-adhesive peeling behaviour, exhibiting a mean squared error (MSE) of 3.66*10^-7 and a R^2 score of 0.94 on test set, demonstrating robust performance. This work introduces a reliable, computationally efficient method for predicting adhesive behaviour, significantly reducing simulation time while maintaining accuracy. This integration of machine learning with high-fidelity biomechanical simulations enables efficient design and optimization of skin-adhesive systems, providing a scalable framework for future research in computational dermato-mechanics and bio-adhesive material design.

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) that respect E(3) symmetries have achieved strong performance on small molecule modeling, but they face scalability and expressiveness challenges when applied to large biomolecules such as RNA and proteins. These systems require models that can simultaneously capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure, such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains. Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems. DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.

Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2) scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small fragment sets. We propose \textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \textbf{Exploitation Penalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a \textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art results in template-based molecular generation.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer trading and the move to decentralized grids have reshaped the energy markets in the United States. Notwithstanding, such developments lead to new challenges, mainly regarding the safety and authenticity of energy trade. This study aimed to develop and build a secure, intelligent, and efficient energy transaction system for the decentralized US energy market. This research interlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy market, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and market reliability. The dataset for this research is comprised of more than 1.2 million anonymized energy transaction records from a simulated peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange network emulating real-life blockchain-based American microgrids, including those tested by LO3 Energy and Grid+ Labs. Each record contains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume (kWh), transaction type (buy/sell), unit price, prosumer/consumer identifier (hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior metrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical pricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of two layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer, each playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing and market intelligence improvement. The machine learning models used in this research were specifically chosen for their established high performance in classification tasks, specifically in the identification of energy transaction fraud in decentralized markets.

Abstract: Identifying suitable machine learning paradigms for intrusion detection remains critical for building effective and generalizable security solutions. In this study, we present a controlled comparison of four representative models - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) - on the CICIDS2017 dataset under two scenarios: detecting known attack types and generalizing to previously unseen threats. Our results show that supervised MLP and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best, demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios. These findings offer practical guidance for selecting IDS models in dynamic network environments.

Abstract: Are there any conditions under which a generative model's outputs are guaranteed not to infringe the copyrights of its training data? This is the question of "provable copyright protection" first posed by Vyas, Kakade, and Barak (ICML 2023). They define near access-freeness (NAF) and propose it as sufficient for protection. This paper revisits the question and establishes new foundations for provable copyright protection -- foundations that are firmer both technically and legally. First, we show that NAF alone does not prevent infringement. In fact, NAF models can enable verbatim copying, a blatant failure of copy protection that we dub being tainted. Then, we introduce our blameless copy protection framework for defining meaningful guarantees, and instantiate it with clean-room copy protection. Clean-room copy protection allows a user to control their risk of copying by behaving in a way that is unlikely to copy in a counterfactual clean-room setting. Finally, we formalize a common intuition about differential privacy and copyright by proving that DP implies clean-room copy protection when the dataset is golden, a copyright deduplication requirement.

<title>Diffusion-based Task-oriented Semantic Communications with Model Inversion Attack</title>

Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising neural network-based system design for 6G networks. Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel paradigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by transmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task performance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining task accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In such attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by analyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based nature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality indicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be inadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences do not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes semantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with self-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our model also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion to ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio environments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric that better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary. Experimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset, DiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable performance under dynamic channels. Our results further demonstrate that significant deviation exists between traditional image quality indicators and the leakage of task-relevant semantic information.

<title>RepuNet: A Reputation System for Mitigating Malicious Clients in DFL</title>

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables nodes to collaboratively train models without a central server, introducing new vulnerabilities since each node independently selects peers for model aggregation. Malicious nodes may exploit this autonomy by sending corrupted models (model poisoning), delaying model submissions (delay attack), or flooding the network with excessive messages, negatively affecting system performance. Existing solutions often depend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as blockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes, message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to 25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior, achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness, and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated learning environments.

Prover Agent coordinates an informal reasoning LLM, a formal prover model, and feedback from Lean while also generating auxiliary lemmas to assist in discovering the overall proof strategy. It achieves an 86.1% success rate on the MiniF2F benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art among methods using small language models (SLMs) with a much lower sample budget than previous approaches.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven dynamic factor framework where a response variable depends on a high-dimensional set of covariates, without imposing any parametric model on the joint dynamics. Leveraging Anisotropic Diffusion Maps, a nonlinear manifold learning technique introduced by Singer and Coifman, our framework uncovers the joint dynamics of the covariates and responses in a purely data-driven way. We approximate the embedding dynamics using linear diffusions, and exploit Kalman filtering to predict the evolution of the covariates and response variables directly from the diffusion map embedding space. We generalize Singer's convergence rate analysis of the graph Laplacian from the case of independent uniform samples on a compact manifold to the case of time series arising from Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space. Furthermore, we provide rigorous justification for our procedure by showing the robustness of approximations of the diffusion map coordinates by linear diffusions, and the convergence of ergodic averages under standard spectral assumptions on the underlying dynamics. We apply our method to the stress testing of equity portfolios using a combination of financial and macroeconomic factors from the Federal Reserve's supervisory scenarios. We demonstrate that our data-driven stress testing method outperforms standard scenario analysis and Principal Component Analysis benchmarks through historical backtests spanning three major financial crises, achieving reductions in mean absolute error of up to 55% and 39% for scenario-based portfolio return prediction, respectively.

Abstract: Channel hopping (CS) communication systems must adapt to interference changes in the wireless network and to node mobility for maintaining throughput efficiency. Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information (i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in interference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant communication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale, thereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks. In this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on a learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP attention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral, spatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a self-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS pattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel occupancy state within that region. Notably, the prediction relies only on locally and passively observed channel activities, and thus introduces no communication overhead. To deal with node mobility, MiLAAP also uses a multi-head self-attention mechanism that lets each node locally capture the spatiotemporal dependencies on other network nodes that can interfere with it and accordingly predict the motion trajectory of those nodes. Detecting nodes that enter or move outside the interference region is used to further improve the prediction accuracy of channel occupancy. We show that for dynamic networks that use local CS sequences to support relatively long-lived flow traffics, the channel state prediction accuracy of MiLAAP is remarkably ~100% across different node mobility patterns and it achieves zero-shot generalizability across different periods of CS sequences.

Abstract: Cloud computing drives innovation but also poses significant environmental challenges due to its high-energy consumption and carbon emissions. Data centers account for 2-4% of global energy usage, and the ICT sector's share of electricity consumption is projected to reach 40% by 2040. As the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 becomes increasingly urgent, there is a growing need for more efficient and transparent solutions, particularly for private cloud infrastructures, which are utilized by 87% of organizations, despite the dominance of public-cloud systems.
  This study evaluates the MAIZX framework, designed to optimize cloud operations and reduce carbon footprint by dynamically ranking resources, including data centers, edge computing nodes, and multi-cloud environments, based on real-time and forecasted carbon intensity, Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), and energy consumption. Leveraging a flexible ranking algorithm, MAIZX achieved an 85.68% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to baseline hypervisor operations. Tested across geographically distributed data centers, the framework demonstrates scalability and effectiveness, directly interfacing with hypervisors to optimize workloads in private, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. MAIZX integrates real-time data on carbon intensity, power consumption, and carbon footprint, as well as forecasted values, into cloud management, providing a robust tool for enhancing climate performance potential while maintaining operational efficiency.

Abstract: Recommender systems play a pivotal role in providing relevant content to users. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun utilizing LLMs to build more powerful recommender systems. However, existing approaches that focus on aligning LLMs with recommendation tasks do not fully leverage their sequential information processing capabilities, leading to suboptimal performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel system called compressed vocabulary expansion (CoVE). In CoVE, each item is assigned a unique ID within the expanded vocabulary. Our framework effectively capitalizes on sequence understanding abilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing their performance on recommendation tasks. Additionally, we compress the embedding layer, making CoVE practical for large-scale industrial applications. The effectiveness and performance of CoVE are demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on multiple recommendation datasets and comparisons with prior works. Our code can be found at https://github.com/HaochenZhang717/CoVE-official-Repo.

Abstract: We propose Guardian-FC, a novel two-layer framework for privacy preserving federated computing that unifies safety enforcement across diverse privacy preserving mechanisms, including cryptographic back-ends like fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and multiparty computation (MPC), as well as statistical techniques such as differential privacy (DP). Guardian-FC decouples guard-rails from privacy mechanisms by executing plug-ins (modular computation units), written in a backend-neutral, domain-specific language (DSL) designed specifically for federated computing workflows and interchangeable Execution Providers (EPs), which implement DSL operations for various privacy back-ends. An Agentic-AI control plane enforces a finite-state safety loop through signed telemetry and commands, ensuring consistent risk management and auditability. The manifest-centric design supports fail-fast job admission and seamless extensibility to new privacy back-ends. We present qualitative scenarios illustrating backend-agnostic safety and a formal model foundation for verification. Finally, we outline a research agenda inviting the community to advance adaptive guard-rail tuning, multi-backend composition, DSL specification development, implementation, and compiler extensibility alongside human-override usability.

Abstract: Team formation and the dynamics of team-based learning have drawn significant interest in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, existing studies primarily focus on unilateral groupings, predefined teams, or fixed-population settings, leaving the effects of algorithmic bilateral grouping choices in dynamic populations underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a framework for learning two-sided team formation in dynamic multi-agent systems. Through this study, we gain insight into what algorithmic properties in bilateral team formation influence policy performance and generalization. We validate our approach using widely adopted multi-agent scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance and improved generalization in most scenarios.

Abstract: Sampling physically valid ligand-binding poses remains a major challenge in molecular docking, particularly for unseen or structurally diverse targets. We introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket exploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established benchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and PoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically valid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when jointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while remaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD alone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets. PocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy across ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce TargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000 protein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem activity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully discriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning baseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina offers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific training and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for high-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, distributional off-policy evaluation (OPE) focuses on estimating the return distribution of a target policy using offline data collected under a different policy. This work focuses on extending the widely used fitted-Q evaluation -- developed for expectation-based reinforcement learning -- to the distributional OPE setting. We refer to this extension as fitted distributional evaluation (FDE). While only a few related approaches exist, there remains no unified framework for designing FDE methods. To fill this gap, we present a set of guiding principles for constructing theoretically grounded FDE methods. Building on these principles, we develop several new FDE methods with convergence analysis and provide theoretical justification for existing methods, even in non-tabular environments. Extensive experiments, including simulations on linear quadratic regulators and Atari games, demonstrate the superior performance of the FDE methods.

Abstract: Photonic device development (PDD) has achieved remarkable success in designing and implementing new devices for controlling light across various wavelengths, scales, and applications, including telecommunications, imaging, sensing, and quantum information processing. PDD is an iterative, five-step process that consists of: i) deriving device behavior from design parameters, ii) simulating device performance, iii) finding the optimal candidate designs from simulations, iv) fabricating the optimal device, and v) measuring device performance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization, material science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods. However, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily costly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large optimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical characterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication processes. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has provided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including surrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for noisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for fabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery. In this review, we present a comprehensive perspective on these methods to enable machine-learning-assisted PDD (ML-PDD) for efficient design optimization with powerful generative models, fast simulation and characterization modeling under noisy measurements, and reinforcement learning for fabrication. This review will provide researchers from diverse backgrounds with valuable insights into this emerging topic, fostering interdisciplinary efforts to accelerate the development of complex photonic devices and systems.

Abstract: Existing multi-media retrieval models either rely on creating a common subspace with modality-specific representation models or require schema mapping among modalities to measure similarities among multi-media data. Our goal is to avoid the annotation overhead incurred from considering retrieval as a supervised classification task and re-use the pretrained encoders in large language models and vision tasks. We propose "FemmIR", a framework to retrieve multimodal results relevant to information needs expressed with multimodal queries by example without any similarity label. Such identification is necessary for real-world applications where data annotations are scarce and satisfactory performance is required without fine-tuning with a common framework across applications. We curate a new dataset called MuQNOL for benchmarking progress on this task. Our technique is based on weak supervision introduced through edit distance between samples: graph edit distance can be modified to consider the cost of replacing a data sample in terms of its properties, and relevance can be measured through the implicit signal from the amount of edit cost among the objects. Unlike metric learning or encoding networks, FemmIR re-uses the high-level properties and maintains the property value and relationship constraints with a multi-level interaction score between data samples and the query example provided by the user. We empirically evaluate FemmIR on a missing person use case with MuQNOL. FemmIR performs comparably to similar retrieval systems in delivering on-demand retrieval results with exact and approximate similarities while using the existing property identifiers in the system.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular, interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning. Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex, reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks aim to infer which websites a user is visiting by analyzing traffic patterns, thereby compromising user anonymity. Although this technique has been demonstrated to be effective in controlled experimental environments, it remains largely limited to small-scale scenarios, typically restricted to recognizing website homepages. In practical settings, however, users frequently access multiple subpages in rapid succession, often before previous content fully loads. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) generalizes the WF framework to large-scale environments by modeling subpages of the same site as distinct classes. These pages often share similar page elements, resulting in lower inter-class variance in traffic features. Furthermore, we consider multi-tab browsing scenarios, in which a single trace encompasses multiple categories of webpages. This leads to overlapping traffic segments, and similar features may appear in different positions within the traffic, thereby increasing the difficulty of classification. To address these challenges, we propose an attention-driven fine-grained WPF attack, named ADWPF. Specifically, during the training phase, we apply targeted augmentation to salient regions of the traffic based on attention maps, including attention cropping and attention masking. ADWPF then extracts low-dimensional features from both the original and augmented traffic and applies self-attention modules to capture the global contextual patterns of the trace. Finally, to handle the multi-tab scenario, we employ the residual attention to generate class-specific representations of webpages occurring at different temporal positions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across datasets of different scales.

Abstract: The convergence of IT and OT has created hyper-connected ICS, exposing critical infrastructure to a new class of adaptive, intelligent adversaries that render static defenses obsolete. Existing security paradigms often fail to address a foundational "Trinity of Trust," comprising the fidelity of the system model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the analytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC framework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous, closed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms race within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the "Red Agent," is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy, physically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while evading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based "Blue Agent" defender is continuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats discovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to become progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously probe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the TEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A comprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including ROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is responsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks. By integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC architecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a necessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future of critical infrastructure.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are non-parametric methods widely recognized for their accuracy and ability to capture complex interactions. While these models excel at prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful relationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of decision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can be manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the response. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control the number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which improves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve optimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for computing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to varying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error bounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the best data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to the same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the large-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the oracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms existing algorithms for rule extraction.

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field of education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order abilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response tests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as a method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require substantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item response theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation of ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset of answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the accuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores increases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores have been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle with inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging automated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in ability estimation while markedly reducing manual grading workload.

Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information. However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot, end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance (QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall (IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical, comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving RAG systems.

Abstract: A growing trend in the database and system communities is to augment conventional index structures, such as B+-trees, with machine learning (ML) models. Among these, error-bounded Piecewise Linear Approximation ($\epsilon$-PLA) has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Despite its central role in many learned indexes, the design and analysis of $\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms remain underexplored. In this paper, we revisit $\epsilon$-PLA from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, with a focus on its application in learned index structures. We first establish a fundamentally improved lower bound of $\Omega(\kappa \cdot \epsilon^2)$ on the expected segment coverage for existing $\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms, where $\kappa$ is a data-dependent constant. We then present a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-PLA algorithms when used in different learned data structures. Our results highlight key trade-offs among model accuracy, model size, and query performance, providing actionable guidelines for the principled design of future learned data structures.

Abstract: The explosive growth of AI research has driven paper submissions at flagship AI conferences to unprecedented levels, necessitating many venues in 2025 (e.g., CVPR, ICCV, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, WSDM) to enforce strict per-author submission limits and to desk-reject any excess papers by simple ID order. While this policy helps reduce reviewer workload, it may unintentionally discard valuable papers and penalize authors' efforts. In this paper, we ask an essential research question on whether it is possible to follow submission limits while minimizing needless rejections. We first formalize the current desk-rejection policies as an optimization problem, and then develop a practical algorithm based on linear programming relaxation and a rounding scheme. Under extensive evaluation on 11 years of real-world ICLR (International Conference on Learning Representations) data, our method preserves up to $19.23\%$ more papers without violating any author limits. Moreover, our algorithm is highly efficient in practice, with all results on ICLR data computed within at most 53.64 seconds. Our work provides a simple and practical desk-rejection strategy that significantly reduces unnecessary rejections, demonstrating strong potential to improve current CS conference submission policies.

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing prediction sets with coverage guarantees. In practice, multiple valid conformal prediction sets may be available, arising from different models or methodologies. However, selecting the most desirable set, such as the smallest, can invalidate the coverage guarantees. To address this challenge, we propose a stability-based approach that ensures coverage for the selected prediction set. We extend our results to the online conformal setting, propose several refinements in settings where additional structure is available, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text. However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance, which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application scenarios.

<title>A Transformer Based Handwriting Recognition System Jointly Using Online and Offline Features</title>

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$ sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams, yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our code can be found here.

Abstract: Universal compression can learn the source and adapt to it either in a batch mode (forward adaptation), or in a sequential mode (backward adaptation). We recast the sequential mode as a multi-armed bandit problem, a fundamental model in reinforcement-learning, and study the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in the lossy compression case. We show that a previously proposed "natural type selection" scheme can be cast as a reconstruction-directed MAB algorithm, for sequential lossy compression, and explain its limitations in terms of robustness and short-block performance. We then derive and analyze robust cost-directed MAB algorithms, which work at any block length.

Abstract: Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making, driving advances in their development and application for medical images. However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and reveal classification errors.

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed, aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases, widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, often at the cost of substantial communication overhead induced by transmitting high-dimensional model updates. This overhead can be alleviated by having the clients quantize their model updates, with dithered lattice quantizers identified as an attractive scheme due to its structural simplicity and convergence-preserving properties. However, existing lattice-based FL schemes typically rely on a fixed quantization rule, which is suboptimal in heterogeneous and dynamic environments where the model updates distribution varies across users and training rounds. In this work, we propose Online Learned Adaptive Lattices (OLALa), a heterogeneous FL framework where each client can adjust its quantizer online using lightweight local computations. We first derive convergence guarantees for FL with non-fixed lattice quantizers and show that proper lattice adaptation can tighten the convergence bound. Then, we design an online learning algorithm that enables clients to tune their quantizers throughout the FL process while exchanging only a compact set of quantization parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that OLALa consistently improves learning performance under various quantization rates, outperforming conventional fixed-codebook and non-adaptive schemes.

Abstract: We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical, biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score (rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning. These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses, and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling. Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP. Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster convergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens, indicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining strategies.

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of output-feedback schemes for systems described by a class of recurrent neural networks. We propose a procedure based on linear matrix inequalities for designing an observer and a static state-feedback controller. The algorithm leverages global and regional incremental input-to-state stability (incremental ISS) and enables the tracking of constant setpoints, ensuring robustness to disturbances and state estimation uncertainty. To address the potential limitations of regional incremental ISS, we introduce an alternative scheme in which the static law is replaced with a tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that exploits regional incremental ISS properties. We show that these conditions enable the formulation of a robust NMPC law with guarantees of convergence and recursive feasibility, leading to an enlarged region of attraction. Theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations on the pH-neutralisation process benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis; it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time, hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D, AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fine-grained action dynamics.

Abstract: Despite its wide range of applications across various domains, the optimization foundations of deep matrix factorization (DMF) remain largely open. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive study of the loss landscape of the regularized DMF problem. Toward this goal, we first provide a closed-form expression of all critical points. Building on this, we establish precise conditions under which a critical point is a local minimizer, a global minimizer, a strict saddle point, or a non-strict saddle point. Leveraging these results, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition under which each critical point is either a local minimizer or a strict saddle point. This provides insights into why gradient-based methods almost always converge to a local minimizer of the regularized DMF problem. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to visualize its loss landscape under different settings to support our theory.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our framework in generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant advancements due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, their practicality is limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module, which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark, outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed. The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of 69.9% on the LaSOT.

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) provide a principled framework for optimizing sequential decision-making in domains where decisions must adapt over time in response to individual trajectories, such as healthcare, education, and digital interventions. However, existing statistical methods often rely on strong positivity assumptions and lack robustness under partial data coverage, while offline reinforcement learning approaches typically focus on average training performance, lack statistical guarantees, and require solving complex optimization problems. To address these challenges, we propose POLAR, a novel pessimistic model-based policy learning algorithm for offline DTR optimization. POLAR estimates the transition dynamics from offline data and quantifies uncertainty for each history-action pair. A pessimistic penalty is then incorporated into the reward function to discourage actions with high uncertainty. Unlike many existing methods that focus on average training performance, POLAR directly targets the suboptimality of the final learned policy and offers theoretical guarantees, without relying on computationally intensive minimax or constrained optimization procedures. To the best of our knowledge, POLAR is the first model-based DTR method to provide both statistical and computational guarantees, including finite-sample bounds on policy suboptimality. Empirical results on both synthetic data and the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that POLAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods and yields near-optimal, history-aware treatment strategies.

Abstract: Linear mixed models (LMMs), which incorporate fixed and random effects, are key tools for analyzing heterogeneous data, such as in personalized medicine or adaptive marketing. Nowadays, this type of data is increasingly wide, sometimes containing thousands of candidate predictors, necessitating sparsity for prediction and interpretation. However, existing sparse learning methods for LMMs do not scale well beyond tens or hundreds of predictors, leaving a large gap compared with sparse methods for linear models, which ignore random effects. This paper closes the gap with a new $\ell_0$ regularized method for LMM subset selection that can run on datasets containing thousands of predictors in seconds to minutes. On the computational front, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm as our main workhorse and provide a guarantee of its convergence. We also develop a local search algorithm to help traverse the nonconvex optimization surface. Both algorithms readily extend to subset selection in generalized LMMs via a penalized quasi-likelihood approximation. On the statistical front, we provide a finite-sample bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the new method. We then demonstrate its excellent performance in synthetic experiments and illustrate its utility on two datasets from biology and journalism.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis, demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free, zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring retraining or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ReCode.

Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models, showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However, logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using two-tower models.

Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL), especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance, while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen. We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens (i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).

Abstract: This study proposes a high-performance dual-parameter full waveform inversion framework (FWI) for ground-penetrating radar (GPR), accelerated through the hybrid compilation of CUDA kernel functions and PyTorch. The method leverages the computational efficiency of GPU programming while preserving the flexibility and usability of Python-based deep learning frameworks. By integrating customized CUDA kernels into PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanism, the framework enables accurate and efficient inversion of both dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity. Experimental evaluations on synthetic data and real wavefield data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves dual-parameter FWI for GPR data while maintaining high accuracy. Moreover, the framework is flexible and extensible, supporting optional regularization strategies such as total variation and multi-scale inversion. These features make the proposed approach a practical and scalable framework for rapid GPR-based subsurface imaging in applications including civil engineering, environmental monitoring, and geophysical exploration.

<title>Global Convergence of Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares for Robust Subspace Recovery</title>

Abstract: Robust subspace estimation is fundamental to many machine learning and data analysis tasks. Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is an elegant and empirically effective approach to this problem, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood. This paper establishes that, under deterministic conditions, a variant of IRLS with dynamic smoothing regularization converges linearly to the underlying subspace from any initialization. We extend these guarantees to affine subspace estimation, a setting that lacks prior recovery theory. Additionally, we illustrate the practical benefits of IRLS through an application to low-dimensional neural network training. Our results provide the first global convergence guarantees for IRLS in robust subspace recovery and, more broadly, for nonconvex IRLS on a Riemannian manifold.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised significant concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions associated with model training and inference. However, existing tools for measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among them. This paper presents WattsOnAI, a comprehensive software toolkit for the measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly integrating with existing AI frameworks, WattsOnAI offers standardized reports and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By addressing critical limitations in existing tools, WattsOnAI encourages the research community to weigh environmental impact alongside raw performance of AI workloads and advances the shift toward more sustainable "Green AI" practices.

<title>Pay Less Attention to Deceptive Artifacts: Robust Detection of Compressed Deepfakes on Online Social Networks</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or ``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects" introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules: Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26 datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the ``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/ManyiLee/PLADA.

Abstract: Traditional wind farm control operates each turbine independently to maximize individual power output. However, coordinated wake steering across the entire farm can substantially increase the combined wind farm energy production. Although dynamic closed-loop control has proven effective in flow control applications, wind farm optimization has relied primarily on static, low-fidelity simulators that ignore critical turbulent flow dynamics. In this work, we present the first reinforcement learning (RL) controller integrated directly with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES), enabling real-time response to atmospheric turbulence through collaborative, dynamic control strategies. Our RL controller achieves a 4.30% increase in wind farm power output compared to baseline operation, nearly doubling the 2.19% gain from static optimal yaw control obtained through Bayesian optimization. These results establish dynamic flow-responsive control as a transformative approach to wind farm optimization, with direct implications for accelerating renewable energy deployment to net-zero targets.

Abstract: The widespread availability of large public datasets is a key factor behind the recent successes of statistical inference and machine learning methods. However, these datasets often contain some low-quality or contaminated data, to which many learning procedures are sensitive. Therefore, the question of whether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate downstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction of principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in the sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners from corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic Robust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures that minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first instantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber estimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness result on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering procedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a heterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared to the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually. We explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem parameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data, observing statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the trade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific) prefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP for large datasets.

Abstract: Identifiable causal representation learning seeks to uncover the true causal relationships underlying a data generation process. In medical imaging, this presents opportunities to improve the generalisability and robustness of task-specific latent features. This work introduces the concept of grouping observations to learn identifiable representations for disease classification in chest X-rays via an end-to-end framework. Our experiments demonstrate that these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across multiple classification tasks when grouping is used to enforce invariance w.r.t race, sex, and imaging views.

<title>First-order methods for stochastic and finite-sum convex optimization with deterministic constraints</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of stochastic and finite-sum convex optimization problems with deterministic constraints. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-$expectedly\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$ solution, in which the expected constraint violation and expected optimality gap are both within a prescribed tolerance $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty, rendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial violations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods for finding an $\epsilon$-$surely\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$ ($\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically bounded by $\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\epsilon$. Our methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified variance-reduced ASG scheme $only\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty subproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish first-order oracle complexity bounds for the proposed methods in computing an $\epsilon$-SFSO solution. As a byproduct, we also derive first-order oracle complexity results for sample average approximation method in computing an $\epsilon$-SFSO solution of the stochastic optimization problem using our proposed methods to solve the sample average problem.

Abstract: Large language model-based machine learning (ML) agents have shown great promise in automating ML research. However, existing agents typically operate in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader research community, where human researchers often gain insights and contribute by sharing knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLE-Live, a live evaluation framework designed to assess an agent's ability to communicate with and leverage collective knowledge from a simulated Kaggle research community. Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at exchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context. CoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2% human competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions. Our code is released at https://github.com/comind-ml/CoMind.

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability, an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification. Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains (plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

Abstract: We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human demonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand motion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's end-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot motion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted motion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with plausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained generalist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows the human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot actions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or paired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes with minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world settings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the retargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the pre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.

Abstract: Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is a technique of updating tuned parameters within recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Several attempts at creating such an algorithm have been made including: Nth Ordered Approximations and Truncated-BPTT. These methods approximate the backpropagation gradients under the assumption that the RNN only utilises short-term dependencies. This is an acceptable assumption to make for the current state of artificial neural networks. As RNNs become more advanced, a shift towards influence by long-term dependencies is likely. Thus, a new method for backpropagation is required. We propose using the 'discrete forward sensitivity equation' and a variant of it for single and multiple interacting recurrent loops respectively. This solution is exact and also allows the network's parameters to vary between each subsequent step, however it does require the computation of a Jacobian.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular machine learning paradigm where intelligent agents interact with the environment to fulfill a long-term goal. Driven by the resurgence of deep learning, Deep RL (DRL) has witnessed great success over a wide spectrum of complex control tasks. Despite the encouraging results achieved, the deep neural network-based backbone is widely deemed as a black box that impedes practitioners to trust and employ trained agents in realistic scenarios where high security and reliability are essential. To alleviate this issue, a large volume of literature devoted to shedding light on the inner workings of the intelligent agents has been proposed, by constructing intrinsic interpretability or post-hoc explainability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing works on eXplainable RL (XRL) and introduce a new taxonomy where prior works are clearly categorized into model-explaining, reward-explaining, state-explaining, and task-explaining methods. We also review and highlight RL methods that conversely leverage human knowledge to promote learning efficiency and performance of agents while this kind of method is often ignored in XRL field. Some challenges and opportunities in XRL are discussed. This survey intends to provide a high-level summarization of XRL and to motivate future research on more effective XRL solutions. Corresponding open source codes are collected and categorized at https://github.com/Plankson/awesome-explainable-reinforcement-learning.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved considerable success in generation tasks. As sampling from DPMs is equivalent to solving diffusion SDE or ODE which is time-consuming, numerous fast sampling methods built upon improved differential equation solvers are proposed. The majority of such techniques consider solving the diffusion ODE due to its superior efficiency. However, stochastic sampling could offer additional advantages in generating diverse and high-quality data. In this work, we engage in a comprehensive analysis of stochastic sampling from two aspects: variance-controlled diffusion SDE and linear multi-step SDE solver. Based on our analysis, we propose \textit{SA-Solver}, which is an improved efficient stochastic Adams method for solving diffusion SDE to generate data with high quality. Our experiments show that \textit{SA-Solver} achieves: 1) improved or comparable performance compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) sampling methods for few-step sampling; 2) SOTA FID on substantial benchmark datasets under a suitable number of function evaluations (NFEs).

Abstract: Machine learning models have shown exceptional prowess in solving complex issues across various domains. However, these models can sometimes exhibit biased decision-making, resulting in unequal treatment of different groups. Despite substantial research on counterfactual fairness, methods to reduce the impact of multivariate and continuous sensitive variables on decision-making outcomes are still underdeveloped. We propose a novel data pre-processing algorithm, Orthogonal to Bias (OB), which is designed to eliminate the influence of a group of continuous sensitive variables, thus promoting counterfactual fairness in machine learning applications. Our approach, based on the assumption of a jointly normal distribution within a structural causal model (SCM), demonstrates that counterfactual fairness can be achieved by ensuring the data is orthogonal to the observed sensitive variables. The OB algorithm is model-agnostic, making it applicable to a wide range of machine learning models and tasks. Additionally, it includes a sparse variant to improve numerical stability through regularization. Empirical evaluations on both simulated and real-world datasets, encompassing settings with both discrete and continuous sensitive variables, show that our methodology effectively promotes fairer outcomes without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this through a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations, along with a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.

Abstract: Active learning methods aim to improve sample complexity in machine learning. In this work, we investigate an active learning scheme via a novel gradient-free cutting-plane training method for ReLU networks of arbitrary depth and develop a convergence theory. We demonstrate, for the first time, that cutting-plane algorithms, traditionally used in linear models, can be extended to deep neural networks despite their nonconvexity and nonlinear decision boundaries. Moreover, this training method induces the first deep active learning scheme known to achieve convergence guarantees, revealing a geometric contraction rate of the feasible set. We exemplify the effectiveness of our proposed active learning method against popular deep active learning baselines via both synthetic data experiments and sentimental classification task on real datasets.

Abstract: A mechanistic understanding of how MLPs do computation in deep neural networks remains elusive. Current interpretability work can extract features from hidden activations over an input dataset but generally cannot explain how MLP weights construct features. One challenge is that element-wise nonlinearities introduce higher-order interactions and make it difficult to trace computations through the MLP layer. In this paper, we analyze bilinear MLPs, a type of Gated Linear Unit (GLU) without any element-wise nonlinearity that nevertheless achieves competitive performance. Bilinear MLPs can be fully expressed in terms of linear operations using a third-order tensor, allowing flexible analysis of the weights. Analyzing the spectra of bilinear MLP weights using eigendecomposition reveals interpretable low-rank structure across toy tasks, image classification, and language modeling. We use this understanding to craft adversarial examples, uncover overfitting, and identify small language model circuits directly from the weights alone. Our results demonstrate that bilinear layers serve as an interpretable drop-in replacement for current activation functions and that weight-based interpretability is viable for understanding deep-learning models.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains deep models across edge devices without centralizing raw data, preserving user privacy. However, client heterogeneity slows down convergence and limits global model accuracy. Clustered FL (CFL) mitigates this by grouping clients with similar representations and training a separate model for each cluster. In practice, client data evolves over time, a phenomenon we refer to as data drift, which breaks cluster homogeneity and degrades performance. Data drift can take different forms depending on whether changes occur in the output values, the input features, or the relationship between them. We propose FIELDING, a CFL framework for handling diverse types of data drift with low overhead. FIELDING detects drift at individual clients and performs selective re-clustering to balance cluster quality and model performance, while remaining robust to malicious clients and varying levels of heterogeneity. Experiments show that FIELDING improves final model accuracy by 1.9-5.9% and achieves target accuracy 1.16x-2.23x faster than existing state-of-the-art CFL methods.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) offers a promising avenue for advancing representation learning in complex signal domains. In this study, we investigate the use of parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs) for speech emotion recognition (SER) a challenging task due to the subtle temporal variations and overlapping affective states in vocal signals. We propose a hybrid quantum classical architecture that integrates PQCs into a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement to enrich emotional feature representations. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets IEMOCAP, RECOLA, and MSP-IMPROV demonstrate that our hybrid model achieves improved classification performance relative to a purely classical CNN baseline, with over 50% reduction in trainable parameters. This work provides early evidence of the potential for QML to enhance emotion recognition and lays the foundation for future quantum-enabled affective computing systems.

Abstract: Machine learning classifiers often produce probabilistic predictions that are critical for accurate and interpretable decision-making in various domains. The quality of these predictions is generally evaluated with proper losses, such as cross-entropy, which decompose into two components: calibration error assesses general under/overconfidence, while refinement error measures the ability to distinguish different classes. In this paper, we present a novel variational formulation of the calibration-refinement decomposition that sheds new light on post-hoc calibration, and enables rapid estimation of the different terms. Equipped with this new perspective, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that calibration and refinement errors are not minimized simultaneously during training. Selecting the best epoch based on validation loss thus leads to a compromise point that is suboptimal for both terms. To address this, we propose minimizing refinement error only during training (Refine,...), before minimizing calibration error post hoc, using standard techniques (...then Calibrate). Our method integrates seamlessly with any classifier and consistently improves performance across diverse classification tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are becoming more capable and widespread, the study of their failure cases is becoming increasingly important. Recent advances in standardizing, measuring, and scaling test-time compute suggest new methodologies for optimizing models to achieve high performance on hard tasks. In this paper, we apply these advances to the task of model jailbreaking: eliciting harmful responses from aligned LLMs. We develop an adversarial reasoning approach to automatic jailbreaking that leverages a loss signal to guide the test-time compute, achieving SOTA attack success rates against many aligned LLMs, even those that aim to trade inference-time compute for adversarial robustness. Our approach introduces a new paradigm in understanding LLM vulnerabilities, laying the foundation for the development of more robust and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Self-Explainable Graph Neural Networks (SE-GNNs) are popular explainable-by-design GNNs, but their explanations' properties and limitations are not well understood. Our first contribution fills this gap by formalizing the explanations extracted by some popular SE-GNNs, referred to as Minimal Explanations (MEs), and comparing them to established notions of explanations, namely Prime Implicant (PI) and faithful explanations. Our analysis reveals that MEs match PI explanations for a restricted but significant family of tasks. In general, however, they can be less informative than PI explanations and are surprisingly misaligned with widely accepted notions of faithfulness. Although faithful and PI explanations are informative, they are intractable to find and we show that they can be prohibitively large. Given these observations, a natural choice is to augment SE-GNNs with alternative modalities of explanations taking care of SE-GNNs' limitations. To this end, we propose Dual-Channel GNNs that integrate a white-box rule extractor and a standard SE-GNN, adaptively combining both channels. Our experiments show that even a simple instantiation of Dual-Channel GNNs can recover succinct rules and perform on par or better than widely used SE-GNNs.

Abstract: A recent line of research has exploited pre-trained generative diffusion models as priors for solving Bayesian inverse problems. We contribute to this research direction by designing a sequential Monte Carlo method for linear-Gaussian inverse problems which builds on "decoupled diffusion", where the generative process is designed such that larger updates to the sample are possible. The method is asymptotically exact and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our Decoupled Diffusion Sequential Monte Carlo (DDSMC) algorithm on both synthetic as well as protein and image data. Further, we demonstrate how the approach can be extended to discrete data.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially in multi-class problems with long-tailed distributions. Existing methods, such as data resampling, cost-sensitive techniques, and logistic loss modifications, though popular and often effective, lack solid theoretical foundations. As an example, we demonstrate that cost-sensitive methods are not Bayes-consistent. This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for analyzing generalization in imbalanced classification. We then propose a new class-imbalanced margin loss function for both binary and multi-class settings, prove its strong $H$-consistency, and derive corresponding learning guarantees based on empirical loss and a new notion of class-sensitive Rademacher complexity. Leveraging these theoretical results, we devise novel and general learning algorithms, IMMAX (Imbalanced Margin Maximization), which incorporate confidence margins and are applicable to various hypothesis sets. While our focus is theoretical, we also present extensive empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithms compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Chemical reaction data is a pivotal asset, driving advances in competitive fields such as pharmaceuticals, materials science, and industrial chemistry. Its proprietary nature renders it sensitive, as it often includes confidential insights and competitive advantages organizations strive to protect. However, in contrast to this need for confidentiality, the current standard training paradigm for machine learning-based retrosynthesis gathers reaction data from multiple sources into one single edge to train prediction models. This paradigm poses considerable privacy risks as it necessitates broad data availability across organizational boundaries and frequent data transmission between entities, potentially exposing proprietary information to unauthorized access or interception during storage and transfer. In the present study, we introduce the chemical knowledge-informed framework (CKIF), a privacy-preserving approach for learning retrosynthesis models. CKIF enables distributed training across multiple chemical organizations without compromising the confidentiality of proprietary reaction data. Instead of gathering raw reaction data, CKIF learns retrosynthesis models through iterative, chemical knowledge-informed aggregation of model parameters. In particular, the chemical properties of predicted reactants are leveraged to quantitatively assess the observable behaviors of individual models, which in turn determines the adaptive weights used for model aggregation. On a variety of reaction datasets, CKIF outperforms several strong baselines by a clear margin.

Abstract: Dynamically integrating new or rapidly evolving information after (Large) Language Model pre-training remains challenging, particularly in low-data scenarios or when dealing with private and specialized documents. In-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face limitations, including their high inference costs and their inability to capture global document information. In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context. Our method outperforms standard next-token prediction and pre-instruction training techniques, across two datasets. Finally, we highlight synergies between KMs and RAG.

Abstract: We consider a common case of the combinatorial semi-bandit problem, the $m$-set semi-bandit, where the learner exactly selects $m$ arms from the total $d$ arms. In the adversarial setting, the best regret bound, known to be $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nmd})$ for time horizon $n$, is achieved by the well-known Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policy. However, this requires to explicitly compute the arm-selection probabilities via optimizing problems at each time step and sample according to them. This problem can be avoided by the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy, which simply pulls the $m$ arms that rank among the $m$ smallest (estimated) loss with random perturbation. In this paper, we show that FTPL with a Fr\'echet perturbation also enjoys the near optimal regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nm}(\sqrt{d\log(d)}+m^{5/6}))$ in the adversarial setting and approaches best-of-both-world regret bounds, i.e., achieves a logarithmic regret for the stochastic setting. Moreover, our lower bounds show that the extra factors are unavoidable with our approach; any improvement would require a fundamentally different and more challenging method.

<title>Proofs as Explanations: Short Certificates for Reliable Predictions</title>

Abstract: We consider a model for explainable AI in which an explanation for a prediction $h(x)=y$ consists of a subset $S'$ of the training data (if it exists) such that all classifiers $h' \in H$ that make at most $b$ mistakes on $S'$ predict $h'(x)=y$. Such a set $S'$ serves as a proof that $x$ indeed has label $y$ under the assumption that (1) the target function $h^\star$ belongs to $H$, and (2) the set $S$ contains at most $b$ corrupted points. For example, if $b=0$ and $H$ is the family of linear classifiers in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and if $x$ lies inside the convex hull of the positive data points in $S$ (and hence every consistent linear classifier labels $x$ as positive), then Carath\'eodory's theorem states that $x$ lies inside the convex hull of $d+1$ of those points. So, a set $S'$ of size $d+1$ could be released as an explanation for a positive prediction, and would serve as a short proof of correctness of the prediction under the assumption of realizability.
  In this work, we consider this problem more generally, for general hypothesis classes $H$ and general values $b\geq 0$. We define the notion of the robust hollow star number of $H$ (which generalizes the standard hollow star number), and show that it precisely characterizes the worst-case size of the smallest certificate achievable, and analyze its size for natural classes. We also consider worst-case distributional bounds on certificate size, as well as distribution-dependent bounds that we show tightly control the sample size needed to get a certificate for any given test example. In particular, we define a notion of the certificate coefficient $\varepsilon_x$ of an example $x$ with respect to a data distribution $D$ and target function $h^\star$, and prove matching upper and lower bounds on sample size as a function of $\varepsilon_x$, $b$, and the VC dimension $d$ of $H$.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward algorithm has evolved in machine learning research, tackling more complex tasks that mimic real-life applications. In the last years, it has been improved by several techniques to perform better than its original version, handling a challenging dataset like CIFAR10 without losing its flexibility and low memory usage. We have shown in our results that improvements are achieved through a combination of convolutional channel grouping, learning rate schedules, and independent block structures during training that lead to a 20\% decrease in test error percentage. Additionally, to approach further implementations on low-capacity hardware projects, we have presented a series of lighter models that achieve low test error percentages within (21$\pm$3)\% and number of trainable parameters between 164,706 and 754,386. This serves as a basis for our future study on complete verification and validation of these kinds of neural networks.

Abstract: The planning and operation of renewable energy, especially wind power, depend crucially on accurate, timely, and high-resolution weather information. Coarse-grid global numerical weather forecasts are typically downscaled to meet these requirements, introducing challenges of scale inconsistency, process representation error, computation cost, and entanglement of distinct uncertainty sources from chaoticity, model bias, and large-scale forcing. We address these challenges by learning the climatological distribution of a target wind farm using its high-resolution numerical weather simulations. An optimal combination of this learned high-resolution climatological prior with coarse-grid large scale forecasts yields highly accurate, fine-grained, full-variable, large ensemble of weather pattern forecasts. Using observed meteorological records and wind turbine power outputs as references, the proposed methodology verifies advantageously compared to existing numerical/statistical forecasting-downscaling pipelines, regarding either deterministic/probabilistic skills or economic gains. Moreover, a 100-member, 10-day forecast with spatial resolution of 1 km and output frequency of 15 min takes < 1 hour on a moderate-end GPU, as contrast to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ CPU hours for conventional numerical simulation. By drastically reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy, our method paves the way for more efficient and reliable renewable energy planning and operation.

Abstract: The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters (10-100X smaller than existing SOTA models) and allow GPU-free inference, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models. The models can be accessed from https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-tspulse-r1

Abstract: Token embeddings play a crucial role in language modeling but, despite this practical relevance, their theoretical understanding remains limited. Our paper addresses the gap by characterizing the structure of embeddings obtained via gradient descent. Specifically, we consider a one-layer softmax attention model with a linear head for binary classification, i.e., $\texttt{Softmax}( p^\top E_X^\top ) E_X v = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_i}) E_{x_i}^\top v}{\sum_{j=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_{j}}) }$, where $E_X = [ E_{x_1} , \dots, E_{x_T} ]^\top$ contains the embeddings of the input sequence, $p$ is the embedding of the $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ token and $v$ the output vector. First, we show that, already after a single step of gradient training with the logistic loss, the embeddings $E_X$ capture the importance of tokens in the dataset by aligning with the output vector $v$ proportionally to the frequency with which the corresponding tokens appear in the dataset. Then, after training $p$ via gradient flow until convergence, the softmax selects the important tokens in the sentence (i.e., those that are predictive of the label), and the resulting $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ embedding maximizes the margin for such a selection. Experiments on real-world datasets (IMDB, Yelp) exhibit a phenomenology close to that unveiled by our theory.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled training examples. Augmenting them with synthetic data has emerged as a promising way to alleviate this issue, but models trained on synthetic samples often face performance degradation due to the inherent gap between real and synthetic distributions. To address this limitation, we develop a theoretical framework that quantifies the impact of such distribution discrepancies on supervised learning, specifically in the context of image classification. More importantly, our framework suggests practical ways to generate good synthetic samples and to train a predictor with high generalization ability. Building upon this framework, we propose a novel theoretical-based algorithm that integrates prototype learning to optimize both data partitioning and model training, effectively bridging the gap between real few-shot data and synthetic data. Extensive experiments results show that our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them across multiple datasets.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention, an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet -- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful meshless tool for topology optimization, capable of simultaneously determining optimal topologies and physical solutions. However, conventional PINNs rely on density-based topology descriptions, which necessitate manual interpolation and limit their applicability to complex geometries. To address this, we propose Lagrangian topology-conscious PINNs (LT-PINNs), a novel framework for boundary-focused engineering optimization. By parameterizing the control variables of topology boundary curves as learnable parameters, LT-PINNs eliminate the need for manual interpolation and enable precise boundary determination. We further introduce specialized boundary condition loss function and topology loss function to ensure sharp and accurate boundary representations, even for intricate topologies. The accuracy and robustness of LT-PINNs are validated via two types of partial differential equations (PDEs), including elastic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and Laplace's equation with Neumann boundary conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate effectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent flow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their engineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming a uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile. The results demonstrate (1) LT-PINNs achieve substantial reductions in relative L2 errors compared with the state-of-art density topology-oriented PINNs (DT-PINNs), (2) LT-PINNs can handle arbitrary boundary conditions, making them suitable for a wide range of PDEs, and (3) LT-PINNs can infer clear topology boundaries without manual interpolation, especially for complex topologies.

Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE) metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/qortmdgh4141/GAS.

Abstract: A Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) network is a depth-2 neural network with random inner weights and biases. Only the outer weights of such an architecture are to be learned, so the learning process boils down to a linear optimization task, allowing one to sidestep the pitfalls of nonconvex optimization problems. In this paper, we prove that an RVFL with ReLU activation functions can approximate Lipschitz continuous functions in $L_\infty$ norm. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first approximation result in $L_\infty$ norm using nice inner weights; namely, Gaussians. We give a nonasymptotic lower bound for the number of hidden-layer nodes to achieve a given accuracy with high probability, depending on, among other things, the Lipschitz constant of the target function, the desired accuracy, and the input dimension. Our method of proof is rooted in probability theory and harmonic analysis.

Abstract: Hybrid variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising for solving practical problems such as combinatorial optimization, quantum chemistry simulation, quantum machine learning, and quantum error correction on noisy quantum computers. However, with typical random ansatz or quantum alternating operator ansatz, derived variational quantum algorithms become a black box that cannot be trusted for model interpretation, not to mention deploying as applications in informing critical decisions: the results of these variational parameters are just rotational angles for the quantum gates and have nothing to do with interpretable values that a model can provide directly. In this paper, we construct the first interpretable quantum regression algorithm, in which the quantum state exactly encodes the classical data table and the variational parameters correspond directly to the regression coefficients, which are real numbers by construction, providing a high degree of model interpretability and minimal cost to optimize due to the right expressiveness. We also take advantage of the encoded data structure to reduce the time complexity of computing the regression map. To shorten the circuit depth for nonlinear regression, our algorithm can be extended by building nonlinear features by classical preprocessing as the independent encoded column vectors. Even though the realization of compressed encoding in superconducting qubits has been achieved by the less noisy compressed encoding recently by the authors, we envision potential quantum utilities with multi-qubit gates implemented in neutral cold atoms and ions.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection has become a cornerstone for several high-level tasks, including autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and traffic surveillance. There are several works focussed on pedestrian detection using visible images, mainly in the daytime. However, this task is very intriguing when the environmental conditions change to poor lighting or nighttime. Recently, new ideas have been spurred to use alternative sources, such as Far InfraRed (FIR) temperature sensor feeds for detecting pedestrians in low-light conditions. This study reviews recent developments in low-light pedestrian detection approaches. It systematically categorizes and analyses various algorithms from region-based to non-region-based and graph-based learning methodologies by highlighting their methodologies, implementation issues, and challenges. It also outlines the key benchmark datasets that can be used for research and development of advanced pedestrian detection algorithms, particularly in low-light situations.

Abstract: A common theoretical approach to understanding neural networks is to take an infinite-width limit, at which point the outputs become Gaussian process (GP) distributed. This is known as a neural network Gaussian process (NNGP). However, the NNGP kernel is fixed and tunable only through a small number of hyperparameters, thus eliminating the possibility of representation learning. This contrasts with finite-width NNs, which are often believed to perform well because they are able to flexibly learn representations for the task at hand. Thus, in simplifying NNs to make them theoretically tractable, NNGPs may eliminate precisely what makes them work well (representation learning). This motivated us to understand whether representation learning is necessary in a range of graph tasks. We develop a precise tool for this task, the graph convolutional deep kernel machine. This is very similar to an NNGP, in that it is an infinite width limit and uses kernels, but comes with a ``knob'' to control the amount of flexibility and hence representation learning. We found that representation learning gives noticeable performance improvements for heterophilous node classification tasks, but less so for homophilous node classification tasks.

Abstract: Language promptable X-ray image segmentation would enable greater flexibility for human-in-the-loop workflows in diagnostic and interventional precision medicine. Prior efforts have contributed task-specific models capable of solving problems within a narrow scope, but expanding to broader use requires additional data, annotations, and training time. Recently, language-aligned foundation models (LFMs) -- machine learning models trained on large amounts of highly variable image and text data thus enabling broad applicability -- have emerged as promising tools for automated image analysis. Existing foundation models for medical image analysis focus on scenarios and modalities where large, richly annotated datasets are available. However, the X-ray imaging modality features highly variable image appearance and applications, from diagnostic chest X-rays to interventional fluoroscopy, with varying availability of data. To pave the way toward an LFM for comprehensive and language-aligned analysis of arbitrary medical X-ray images, we introduce FluoroSAM, a language-promptable variant of the Segment Anything Model, trained from scratch on 3M synthetic X-ray images from a wide variety of human anatomies, imaging geometries, and viewing angles. These include pseudo-ground truth masks for 128 organ types and 464 tools with associated text descriptions. FluoroSAM is capable of segmenting myriad anatomical structures and tools based on natural language prompts, thanks to the novel incorporation of vector quantization (VQ) of text embeddings in the training process. We demonstrate FluoroSAM's performance quantitatively on real X-ray images and showcase on several applications how FluoroSAM is a key enabler for rich human-machine interaction in the X-ray image acquisition and analysis context.

Abstract: Effective recommender systems play a crucial role in accurately capturing user and item attributes that mirror individual preferences. Some existing recommendation techniques have started to shift their focus towards modeling various types of interactive relations between users and items in real-world recommendation scenarios, such as clicks, marking favorites, and purchases on online shopping platforms. Nevertheless, these approaches still grapple with two significant challenges: (1) Insufficient modeling and exploitation of the impact of various behavior patterns formed by multiplex relations between users and items on representation learning, and (2) ignoring the effect of different relations within behavior patterns on the target relation in recommender system scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel recommendation framework, Dual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Network (DCMGNN), which addresses the aforementioned challenges. It incorporates an explicit behavior pattern representation learner to capture the behavior patterns composed of multiplex user-item interactive relations, and includes a relation chain representation learner and a relation chain-aware encoder to discover the impact of various auxiliary relations on the target relation, the dependencies between different relations, and mine the appropriate order of relations in a behavior pattern. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DCMGNN surpasses various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. It outperforms the best baselines by 10.06% and 12.15% on average across all datasets in terms of Recall@10 and NDCG@10, respectively.

Abstract: Manipulation tasks require robots to reason about cause and effect when interacting with objects. Yet, many data-driven approaches lack causal semantics and thus only consider correlations. We introduce COBRA-PPM, a novel causal Bayesian reasoning architecture that combines causal Bayesian networks and probabilistic programming to perform interventional inference for robot manipulation under uncertainty. We demonstrate its capabilities through high-fidelity Gazebo-based experiments on an exemplar block stacking task, where it predicts manipulation outcomes with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%) and performs greedy next-best action selection with a 94.2% task success rate. We further demonstrate sim2real transfer on a domestic robot, showing effectiveness in handling real-world uncertainty from sensor noise and stochastic actions. Our generalised and extensible framework supports a wide range of manipulation scenarios and lays a foundation for future work at the intersection of robotics and causality.

<title>Data Quality in Crowdsourcing and Spamming Behavior Detection</title>

Abstract: As crowdsourcing emerges as an efficient and cost-effective method for obtaining labels for machine learning datasets, it is important to assess the quality of crowd-provided data, so as to improve analysis performance and reduce biases in subsequent machine learning tasks. Given the lack of ground truth in most cases of crowdsourcing, we refer to data quality as annotators' consistency and credibility. Unlike the simple scenarios where Kappa coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient usually can apply, online crowdsourcing requires dealing with more complex situations. We introduce a systematic method for evaluating data quality and detecting spamming threats via variance decomposition, and we classify spammers into three categories based on their different behavioral patterns. A spammer index is proposed to assess entire data consistency, and two metrics are developed to measure crowd workers' credibility by utilizing the Markov chain and generalized random effects models. Furthermore, we showcase the practicality of our techniques and their advantages by applying them on a face verification task with both simulation and real-world data collected from two crowdsourcing platforms.

Abstract: Popular debiased estimation methods for causal inference -- such as augmented inverse propensity weighting and targeted maximum likelihood estimation -- enjoy desirable asymptotic properties like statistical efficiency and double robustness but they can produce unstable estimates when there is limited overlap between treatment and control, requiring additional assumptions or ad hoc adjustments in practice (e.g., truncating propensity scores). In contrast, simple plug-in estimators are stable but lack desirable asymptotic properties. We propose a novel debiasing approach that achieves the best of both worlds, producing stable plug-in estimates with desirable asymptotic properties. Our constrained learning framework solves for the best plug-in estimator under the constraint that the first-order error with respect to the plugged-in quantity is zero, and can leverage flexible model classes including neural networks and tree ensembles. In several experimental settings, including ones in which we handle text-based covariates by fine-tuning language models, our constrained learning-based estimator outperforms basic versions of one-step estimation and targeting in challenging settings with limited overlap between treatment and control, and performs similarly otherwise. Finally, to understand why our method exhibits superior performance in settings with low overlap, we present a theoretical example with heavy-tailed inverse propensity scores in which other debiased estimators converge more slowly compared to ours.

<title>Contextual Optimization under Covariate Shift: A Robust Approach by Intersecting Wasserstein Balls</title>

Abstract: In contextual optimization, a decision-maker leverages contextual information, often referred to as covariates, to better resolve uncertainty and make informed decisions. In this paper, we examine the challenges of contextual decision-making under covariate shift, a phenomenon where the distribution of covariates differs between the training and test environments. Such shifts can lead to inaccurate upstream estimations for test covariates that lie far from the training data, ultimately resulting in suboptimal downstream decisions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Intersection Wasserstein-balls DRO (IW-DRO), which integrates multiple estimation methods into the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. At the core of our approach is an innovative ambiguity set defined as the intersection of two Wasserstein balls, with their centers constructed using appropriate nonparametric and parametric estimators. On the computational side, we reformulate the IW-DRO problem as a tractable convex program and develop an approximate algorithm tailored for large-scale problems to enhance computational efficiency. From a theoretical perspective, we demonstrate that IW-DRO achieves superior performance compared to single Wasserstein-ball DRO models. We further establish performance guarantees by analyzing the coverage of the intersection ambiguity set and the measure concentration of both estimators under the Wasserstein distance. Notably, we derive a finite-sample concentration result for the Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator under covariate shift. The proposed IW-DRO framework offers practical value for decision-makers operating in uncertain environments affected by covariate shifts.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) attempts to predict missing facts in a Knowledge Graph (KG). Recently, there's been an increased focus on designing KGC methods that can excel in the inductive setting, where a portion or all of the entities and relations seen in inference are unobserved during training. Numerous benchmark datasets have been proposed for inductive KGC, all of which are subsets of existing KGs used for transductive KGC. However, we find that the current procedure for constructing inductive KGC datasets inadvertently creates a shortcut that can be exploited even while disregarding the relational information. Specifically, we observe that the Personalized PageRank (PPR) score can achieve strong or near SOTA performance on most datasets. In this paper, we study the root cause of this problem. Using these insights, we propose an alternative strategy for constructing inductive KGC datasets that helps mitigate the PPR shortcut. We then benchmark multiple popular methods using the newly constructed datasets and analyze their performance. The new benchmark datasets help promote a better understanding of the capabilities and challenges of inductive KGC by removing any shortcuts that obfuscate performance. The code and dataset and can be found at https://github.com/HarryShomer/Better-Inductive-KGC.

Abstract: Recent advances in imitative reinforcement learning (IRL) have considerably enhanced the ability of autonomous agents to assimilate expert demonstrations, leading to rapid skill acquisition in a range of demanding tasks. However, such learning-based agents face significant challenges when transferring knowledge to highly dynamic closed-loop environments. Their performance is significantly impacted by the conflicting optimization objectives of imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL), sample inefficiency, and the complexity of uncovering the hidden world model and physics. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-informed IRL that is entirely data-driven. It leverages both expert demonstration data and exploratory data with a joint optimization objective, allowing the underlying physical principles of vehicle dynamics to emerge naturally from the training process. The performance is evaluated through empirical experiments and results exceed popular IL, RL and IRL algorithms in closed-loop settings on Waymax benchmark. Our approach exhibits 37.8% reduction in collision rate and 22.2% reduction in off-road rate compared to the baseline method.

Abstract: As language models support larger and larger context sizes, evaluating their ability to make effective use of that context becomes increasingly important. We analyze the ability of several code generation models to handle long range dependencies using a suite of multi-step key retrieval tasks in context windows up to 8k tokens in length. The tasks progressively increase in difficulty and allow more nuanced evaluation of model capabilities than tests like the popular needle-in-the-haystack test. We find that performance degrades significantly for many models (up to 2x) when a function references another function that is defined later in the prompt. We also observe that models that use sliding window attention mechanisms have difficulty handling references further than the size of a single window. We perform simple prompt modifications using call graph information to improve multi-step retrieval performance up to 3x. Our analysis highlights ways that long-context performance needs deeper consideration beyond retrieval of single facts within a document.

<title>Fuzz-Testing Meets LLM-Based Agents: An Automated and Efficient Framework for Jailbreaking Text-To-Image Generation Models</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation by transforming textual descriptions into high-quality images. However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks. JailFuzzer is open-source and available at this repository: https://github.com/YingkaiD/JailFuzzer.

<title>BINDy -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics with reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo</title>

arXiv:2408.08062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model parsimony is an important \emph{cognitive bias} in data-driven modelling that aids interpretability and helps to prevent over-fitting. Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) methods are able to learn sparse representations of complex dynamics directly from data, given a basis of library functions. In this work, a novel Bayesian treatment of dictionary learning system identification, as an alternative to SINDy, is envisaged. The proposed method -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics (BINDy) -- is distinct from previous approaches in that it targets the full joint posterior distribution over both the terms in the library and their parameterisation in the model. This formulation confers the advantage that an arbitrary prior may be placed over the model structure to produce models that are sparse in the model space rather than in parameter space. Because this posterior is defined over parameter vectors that can change in dimension, the inference cannot be performed by standard techniques. Instead, a Gibbs sampler based on reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo is proposed. BINDy is shown to compare favourably to ensemble SINDy in three benchmark case-studies. In particular, it is seen that the proposed method is better able to assign high probability to correct model terms.

arXiv:2409.08160v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new perspective on how readers integrate context during real-time language comprehension. Our proposals build on surprisal theory, which posits that the processing effort of a linguistic unit (e.g., a word) is an affine function of its in-context information content. We first observe that surprisal is only one out of many potential ways that a contextual predictor can be derived from a language model. Another one is the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between a unit and its context, which turns out to yield the same predictive power as surprisal when controlling for unigram frequency. Moreover, both PMI and surprisal are correlated with frequency. This means that neither PMI nor surprisal contains information about context alone. In response to this, we propose a technique where we project surprisal onto the orthogonal complement of frequency, yielding a new contextual predictor that is uncorrelated with frequency. Our experiments show that the proportion of variance in reading times explained by context is a lot smaller when context is represented by the orthogonalized predictor. From an interpretability standpoint, this indicates that previous studies may have overstated the role that context has in predicting reading times.

Abstract: Large language models have evolved to process multiple modalities beyond text, such as images and audio, which motivates us to explore how to effectively leverage them for graph reasoning tasks. The key question, therefore, is how to transform graphs into linear sequences of tokens, a process we term "graph linearization", so that LLMs can handle graphs naturally. We consider that graphs should be linearized meaningfully to reflect certain properties of natural language text, such as local dependency and global alignment, in order to ease contemporary LLMs, trained on trillions of textual tokens, better understand graphs. To achieve this, we developed several graph linearization methods based on graph centrality and degeneracy. These methods are further enhanced using node relabeling techniques. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods compared to the random linearization baseline. Our work introduces novel graph representations suitable for LLMs, contributing to the potential integration of graph machine learning with the trend of multimodal processing using a unified transformer model.

Abstract: The concept of world models has garnered significant attention due to advancements in multimodal large language models such as GPT-4 and video generation models such as Sora, which are central to the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the literature on world models. Generally, world models are regarded as tools for either understanding the present state of the world or predicting its future dynamics. This review presents a systematic categorization of world models, emphasizing two primary functions: (1) constructing internal representations to understand the mechanisms of the world, and (2) predicting future states to simulate and guide decision-making. Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects. Finally, we outline key challenges and provide insights into potential future research directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/World-Model.

Abstract: The search for radio technosignatures is an anomaly detection problem: Candidate signals represent needles of interest in the proverbial haystack of radio-frequency interference (RFI). Current search frameworks find an enormity of false-positive signals, especially in large surveys, requiring manual follow-up to a sometimes prohibitive degree. Unsupervised learning provides an algorithmic way to winnow the most anomalous signals from the chaff, as well as group together RFI signals that bear morphological similarities. We present GLOBULAR (Grouping Low-frequency Observations By Unsupervised Learning After Reduction) clustering, a signal processing method that uses HDBSCAN to reduce the false-positive rate and isolate outlier signals for further analysis. When combined with a standard narrowband signal detection and spatial filtering pipeline, such as turboSETI, GLOBULAR clustering offers significant improvements in the false-positive rate over the standard pipeline alone, suggesting dramatic potential for the amelioration of manual follow-up requirements for future large surveys. By removing RFI signals in regions of high spectral occupancy, GLOBULAR clustering may also enable the detection of signals missed by the standard pipeline. We benchmark our method against the Choza et al. turboSETI-only search of 97 nearby galaxies at the L band, demonstrating a false-positive hit reduction rate of 93.1% and a false-positive event reduction rate of 99.3%.

Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) is a growing area of research. In HRI, complex command (action) classification is still an open problem that usually prevents the real applicability of such a technique. The literature presents some works that use neural networks to detect these actions. However, occlusion is still a major issue in HRI, especially when using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), since, during the robot's movement, the human operator is often out of the robot's field of view. Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones. The FL enabled our approach to be trained in a distributed fashion, i.e., access to data without the need for cloud or other repositories, which facilitates the multi-robot system's learning. Furthermore, our multi-robot approach results also prevented occlusion situations, with experiments with real robots achieving an accuracy greater than 96%.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables the model to perform new tasks conditioning only on the examples provided in the context without updating the model's weights. While ICL offers fast adaptation across natural language tasks and domains, its emergence is less straightforward for modalities beyond text. In this work, we systematically uncover properties present in LLMs that support the emergence of ICL for autoregressive models and various modalities by promoting the learning of the needed mechanisms for ICL. We identify exact token repetitions in the training data sequences as an important factor for ICL. Such repetitions further improve stability and reduce transiency in ICL performance. Moreover, we emphasise the significance of training task difficulty for the emergence of ICL. Finally, by applying our novel insights on ICL emergence, we unlock ICL capabilities for various visual datasets and a more challenging EEG classification task in a few-shot learning regime.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities represent a critical frontier for large language models (LLMs), but developing them requires extensive proprietary datasets and computational resources. One way to efficiently supplement capabilities with is by model merging, which offers a promising alternative by combining multiple models without retraining. However, current merging approaches rely on manually-designed strategies for merging hyperparameters, limiting the exploration of potential model combinations and requiring significant human effort. We propose an Automated Model Merging Framework that enables fine-grained exploration of merging strategies while reducing costs through multi-fidelity approximations. We support both single and multi-objective optimization and introduce two novel search spaces: layerwise fusion (LFS) and depth-wise integration (DIS). Evaluating across a number of benchmarks, we find that the search autonomously finds 1) Merges that further boost single-objective performance, even on tasks the model has already been finetuned on, and 2) Merges that optimize multi-objective frontiers across tasks. Effective merges are found with limited compute, e.g. within less than 500 search steps.

Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation. As a proof-of-concept study, we use WyckoffDiff to find new materials below the convex hull of thermodynamical stability.

Abstract: The increasing use of generative ML foundation models for image restoration tasks such as super-resolution calls for robust and interpretable uncertainty quantification methods. We address this need by presenting a novel approach based on conformal prediction techniques to create a 'confidence mask' capable of reliably and intuitively communicating where the generated image can be trusted. Our method is adaptable to any black-box generative model, including those locked behind an opaque API, requires only easily attainable data for calibration, and is highly customizable via the choice of a local image similarity metric. We prove strong theoretical guarantees for our method that span fidelity error control (according to our local image similarity metric), reconstruction quality, and robustness in the face of data leakage. Finally, we empirically evaluate these results and establish our method's solid performance.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein structural tokenization methods, which chunk protein 3D structures into discrete or continuous representations. Structure tokenization enables the direct application of powerful techniques like language modeling for protein structures, and large multimodal models to integrate structures with protein sequences and functional texts. Despite the progress, the capabilities and limitations of these methods remain poorly understood due to the lack of a unified evaluation framework. We first introduce StructTokenBench, a framework that comprehensively evaluates the quality and efficiency of structure tokenizers, focusing on fine-grained local substructures rather than global structures, as typical in existing benchmarks. Our evaluations reveal that no single model dominates all benchmarking perspectives. Observations of codebook under-utilization led us to develop AminoAseed, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances codebook gradient updates and optimally balances codebook size and dimension for improved tokenizer utilization and quality. Compared to the leading model ESM3, our method achieves an average of 6.31% performance improvement across 24 supervised tasks, with sensitivity and utilization rates increased by 12.83% and 124.03%, respectively.

Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pretrain the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode. We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow reconstruction. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large foundation models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping to accelerate the development cycle for new detectors and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.

<title>Rewarding Graph Reasoning Process makes LLMs more Generalized Reasoners</title>

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), developing advanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs remains a key challenge. Process Reward Models (PRMs) have demonstrated exceptional promise in enhancing reasoning by providing step-wise feedback, particularly in the context of mathematical reasoning. However, their application to broader reasoning domains remains understudied, largely due to the high costs associated with manually creating step-level supervision. In this work, we explore the potential of PRMs in graph reasoning problems - a domain that demands sophisticated multi-step reasoning and offers opportunities for automated step-level data generation using established graph algorithms. We introduce GraphSILO, the largest dataset for graph reasoning problems with fine-grained step-wise labels, built using automated Task-oriented Trajectories and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate detailed reasoning steps with step-wise labels. Building upon this dataset, we train GraphPRM, the first PRM designed for graph reasoning problems, and evaluate its effectiveness in two key settings: inference-time scaling and reinforcement learning via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that GraphPRM significantly improves LLM performance across 13 graph reasoning tasks, delivering a 9% gain for Qwen2.5-7B and demonstrating transferability to new graph reasoning datasets and new reasoning domains like mathematical problem-solving. Notably, GraphPRM enhances LLM performance on GSM8K and Math500, underscoring the cross-domain applicability of graph-based reasoning rewards. Our findings highlight the potential of PRMs in advancing reasoning across diverse domains, paving the way for more versatile and effective LLMs.

Abstract: This paper studies a Conformal Prediction (CP) methodology for building prediction intervals in a regression setting, given only deterministic lower and upper bounds on the target variable. It proposes a new CP mechanism (CPUL) that goes beyond post-processing by adopting a model selection approach over multiple nested interval construction methods. Paradoxically, many well-established CP methods, including CPUL, may fail to provide adequate coverage in regions where the bounds are tight. To remedy this limitation, the paper proposes an optimal thresholding mechanism, OMLT, that adjusts CPUL intervals in tight regions with undercoverage. The combined CPUL-OMLT is validated on large-scale learning tasks where the goal is to bound the optimal value of a parametric optimization problem. The experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline methods across various datasets.

Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum vision transformers (QViTs), vision transformers (ViTs) with self-attention (SA) mechanisms replaced by quantum self-attention (QSA) mechanisms, can match state-of-the-art (SOTA) biomedical image classifiers while using 99.99% fewer parameters. QSAs are produced by replacing linear SA layers with parameterised quantum neural networks (QNNs), producing a QSA mechanism and reducing parameter scaling from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. On RetinaMNIST, our ultra parameter-efficient QViT outperforms 13/14 SOTA methods including CNNs and ViTs, achieving 56.5% accuracy, just 0.88% below the top MedMamba model while using 99.99% fewer parameters (1K vs 14.5M) and 89% fewer GFLOPs. We present the first investigation of knowledge distillation (KD) from classical to quantum vision transformers in biomedical image classification, showing that QViTs maintain comparable performance to classical ViTs across eight diverse datasets spanning multiple modalities, with improved QSA parameter-efficiency. Our higher-qubit architecture benefitted more from KD pre-training, suggesting a scaling relationship between QSA parameters and KD effectiveness. These findings establish QSA as a practical architectural choice toward parameter-efficient biomedical image analysis.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based tools for 3D phenotyping, especially for maize, has been limited due to the lack of large and diverse 3D datasets. 2D image datasets fail to capture essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we present MaizeField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/MaizeField3D/), a curated dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset includes 1,045 high-quality point clouds of field-grown maize collected using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Point clouds of 520 plants from this dataset were segmented and annotated using a graph-based segmentation method to isolate individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples. This labeled data was then used for fitting procedural models that provide a structured parametric representation of the maize plants. The leaves of the maize plants in the procedural models are represented using Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces that were generated using a two-step optimization process combining gradient-free and gradient-based methods. We conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata annotations. The dataset also includes metadata detailing plant morphology and quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled point cloud data (100k, 50k, 10k points), which can be readily used for different downstream computational tasks. MaizeField3D will serve as a comprehensive foundational dataset for AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in agricultural research.

Abstract: The Riemann problem is fundamental in the computational modeling of hyperbolic partial differential equations, enabling the development of stable and accurate upwind schemes. While exact solvers provide robust upwinding fluxes, their high computational cost necessitates approximate solvers. Although approximate solvers achieve accuracy in many scenarios, they produce inaccurate solutions in certain cases. To overcome this limitation, we propose constructing neural network-based surrogate models, trained using supervised learning, designed to map interior and exterior conservative state variables to the corresponding exact flux. Specifically, we propose two distinct approaches: one utilizing a vanilla neural network and the other employing a bi-fidelity neural network. The performance of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through applications to one-dimensional and two-dimensional partial differential equations, showcasing their robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 3x10^-2 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 2.75 MPa on unseen test data.

arXiv:2503.19777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a training-free method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs). Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets. Code: https://github.com/vladan-stojnic/LPOSS

Abstract: By analogy to curved exponential families in statistics, we define curved Bregman divergences as Bregman divergences restricted to nonlinear parameter subspaces. We show that the barycenter of a finite weighted set of parameters under a curved Bregman divergence amounts to the right Bregman projection onto the nonlinear subspace of the barycenter with respect to the full Bregman divergence. We demonstrate the significance of curved Bregman divergences with two examples: (1) symmetrized Bregman divergences and (2) the Kullback-Leibler divergence between circular complex normal distributions. We then consider monotonic embeddings to define representational curved Bregman divergences and show that the $\alpha$-divergences are representational curved Bregman divergences with respect to $\alpha$-embeddings of the probability simplex into the positive measure cone. As an application, we report an efficient method to calculate the intersection of a finite set of $\alpha$-divergence spheres.

Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) in sequential settings, aimed at complex systems where gradient information is unavailable. Our method combines Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) for design optimization with the Affine-Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI) sampler for efficient posterior sampling-both of which are derivative-free and ensemble-based. To address the computational challenges posed by nested expectations in BOED, we propose variational Gaussian and parametrized Laplace approximations that provide tractable upper and lower bounds on the Expected Information Gain (EIG). These approximations enable scalable utility estimation in high-dimensional spaces and PDE-constrained inverse problems. We demonstrate the performance of our framework through numerical experiments ranging from linear Gaussian models to PDE-based inference tasks, highlighting the method's robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in information-driven experimental design.

arXiv:2505.03906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development through code generation capabilities, yet their effectiveness for high-performance computing (HPC) remains limited. HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6\% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9\% performance improvement over the base MARCO system. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Understanding people's preferences and needs is crucial for urban planning decisions, yet current approaches often combine them from multi-cultural and multi-city populations, obscuring important demographic differences and risking amplifying biases. We conducted a large-scale urban visual perception survey of streetscapes worldwide using street view imagery, examining how demographics -- including gender, age, income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the first time, personality traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants, with balanced demographics, from five countries and 45 nationalities. This dataset, introduced as Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics (SPECS), exhibits statistically significant differences in perception scores in six traditionally used indicators (safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring, and depressing) and four new ones we propose (live nearby, walk, cycle, green) among demographics and personalities. We revealed that location-based sentiments are carried over in people's preferences when comparing urban streetscapes with other cities. Further, we compared the perception scores based on where participants and streetscapes are from. We found that an off-the-shelf machine learning model trained on an existing global perception dataset tends to overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative ones compared to human responses, suggesting that targeted intervention should consider locals' perception. Our study aspires to rectify the myopic treatment of street perception, which rarely considers demographics or personality traits.

Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.

<title>Recycling the Web: A Method to Enhance Pre-training Data Quality and Quantity for Language Models</title>

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However, their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages. For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Abstract: This paper argues that AI alignment is not merely difficult, but is founded on a fundamental logical contradiction. We first establish The Enumeration Paradox: we use machine learning precisely because we cannot enumerate all necessary safety rules, yet making ML safe requires examples that can only be generated from the very enumeration we admit is impossible. This paradox is then confirmed by a set of five independent mathematical proofs, or "pillars of impossibility." Our main results show that: (1) Geometric Impossibility: The set of safe policies has measure zero, a necessary consequence of projecting infinite-dimensional world-context requirements onto finite-dimensional models. (2) Computational Impossibility: Verifying a policy's safety is coNP-complete, even for non-zero error tolerances. (3) Statistical Impossibility: The training data required for safety (abundant examples of rare disasters) is a logical contradiction and thus unobtainable. (4) Information-Theoretic Impossibility: Safety rules contain more incompressible, arbitrary information than any feasible network can store. (5) Dynamic Impossibility: The optimization process for increasing AI capability is actively hostile to safety, as the gradients for the two objectives are generally anti-aligned. Together, these results demonstrate that the pursuit of safe, highly capable AI is not a matter of overcoming technical hurdles, but of confronting fundamental, interlocking barriers. The paper concludes by presenting a strategic trilemma that these impossibilities force upon the field. A formal verification of the core theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

<title>Fine-Grained Perturbation Guidance via Attention Head Selection</title>

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Variational Learning (VL) has recently gained popularity for training deep neural networks and is competitive to standard learning methods. Part of its empirical success can be explained by theories such as PAC-Bayes bounds, minimum description length and marginal likelihood, but there are few tools to unravel the implicit regularization in play. Here, we analyze the implicit regularization of VL through the Edge of Stability (EoS) framework. EoS has previously been used to show that gradient descent can find flat solutions and we extend this result to VL to show that it can find even flatter solutions. This is obtained by controlling the posterior covariance and the number of Monte Carlo samples from the posterior. These results are derived in a similar fashion as the standard EoS literature for deep learning, by first deriving a result for a quadratic problem and then extending it to deep neural networks. We empirically validate these findings on a wide variety of large networks, such as ResNet and ViT, to find that the theoretical results closely match the empirical ones. Ours is the first work to analyze the EoS dynamics in VL.

Abstract: Solving Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems is fundamental to robotics, but has primarily been successful with single serial manipulators. For multi-arm robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy, precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information. However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500 expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE), Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities, with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score (ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at 78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a private set for evaluation.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces DML-CMR, a two-stage estimator for solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) often encountered in statistics, causal inference, and econometrics. Many causal inference techniques, such as instrumental variable regression and proximal causal learning, fall under the CMR framework. The DML-CMR algorithm aims to reduce bias and overfitting present in existing CMR estimators, particularly those utilizing deep neural network estimators. By following the double/debiased machine learning framework, DML-CMR provides an unbiased estimate with a fast convergence rate guarantee of O(N^-1/2) under certain conditions. The algorithm is applied to various real-world datasets for IV regression and proximal causal learning, showcasing superior performance compared to existing CMR estimators and problem-specific algorithms. <div>

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities. Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems. Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest. However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

Summary:
Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can enhance adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning may compromise safety alignment, increasing susceptibility to harmful outputs. In this study, the Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA) approach is introduced to selectively remove LoRA layers that weaken safety alignment, improving safety while maintaining or enhancing performance. The Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM) metric is used to detect safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models, leading to better safety-utility trade-offs. Results from experiments on LLMs demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms existing safety alignment methods, reducing safety risks while improving model performance and reliability. Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code for SPLoRA is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core, we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability. Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/AoShuang92/SPLoRA.

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer. Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel, CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to 1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42% relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive representations.

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features, pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and 15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%), significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability, low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding processes.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces HOLA, an optimization framework for efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices. Internally, it uses Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) for quicker inference without compromising quality. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts retrieval complexity based on context requirements. Additionally, the framework includes LoBi, a combination of structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization for further optimization. HOLA demonstrates significant improvements such as a 17.6% EMA on GSM8K, a 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory usage on edge devices like Jetson Nano. This makes HOLA both scalable and ready for production use. <div>

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains: 17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.

<div> sensor networks, deep learning, traffic monitoring, structural health monitoring, graph neural networks

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of reliable traffic monitoring for assessing the remaining service life of bridges, focusing on the role of traffic load. Traditional computer vision-based approaches face limitations such as privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while non-vision-based methods lack flexibility. To address these issues, a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks is proposed. The approach combines high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture spatial structure and data interdependence. By transferring knowledge from computer vision outputs to SHM sensors, the framework achieves comparable accuracy to vision-based systems with minimal human intervention. In a real-world case study using accelerometer and strain gauge data, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with high classification accuracies for light and heavy vehicles. <div>

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

Summary:<br />
Interpretability is crucial for deploying deep learning models in critical care, but common algorithms face challenges in dynamic prediction tasks where patient trajectories change over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based methods struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal smoothness. This study analyzes these limitations and suggests learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as more effective alternatives. These frameworks can incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn feature importance over time, providing more reliable interpretations for dynamic timeseries prediction in critical care and similar domains. <div>

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar domains.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach to synthetic data generation for health applications, focusing on maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes. By incorporating causal fairness metrics, the proposed LLM-augmented method enhances the generation of high-quality data while ensuring equitable outcomes. The generated data closely aligns with real-world data on causal fairness metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving causal structure. Training on causally fair predictors further reduces bias on sensitive attributes, showcasing a 70% improvement compared to real data. This advancement in creating fair synthetic data is crucial for promoting equitable health research and improving healthcare delivery. This innovative approach supports the need for unbiased data in the health sector, ultimately contributing to more inclusive and equitable outcomes. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors, synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable health research and healthcare delivery.

Abstract: Recent advancements have brought generated music closer to human-created compositions, yet evaluating these models remains challenging. While human preference is the gold standard for assessing quality, translating these subjective judgments into objective metrics, particularly for text-audio alignment and music quality, has proven difficult. In this work, we generate 6k songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conduct a survey of 15k pairwise audio comparisons with 2.5k human participants to evaluate the correlation between human preferences and widely used metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to rank current state-of-the-art music generation models and metrics based on human preference. To further the field of subjective metric evaluation, we provide open access to our dataset of generated music and human evaluations.

Summary: 
The study evaluates the performance of the Aurora foundation model in predicting hydrological variables not considered during pretraining. A lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent representations of the pretrained model is introduced, compared to fine-tuning the full model. The decoder-based approach requires less training time and memory while achieving strong accuracy and preserving autoregressive stability. Decoder accuracy depends on the physical correlation between new variables and those used during pretraining. This indicates that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical relationships. The study argues that foundation models in Earth sciences should be able to be extended to new variables without full fine-tuning, making them more accessible to communities with limited resources and supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

Summary: 
Neural networks trained on data can be challenging to describe mathematically, but there is growing understanding of their representational capabilities. Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function can represent continuous and piecewise linear functions, approximating many others. The study of their expressivity explores what functions they can represent. Viewing neural networks as algorithms, they can be constructed explicitly for specific tasks like sorting. These constructed networks are often recursive and parallel, with deep networks outperforming shallow ones due to their increased depth of recursion. While ReLU networks have the limitation of being continuous, they can have optimal computational complexity for large input dimensions. The examples provided highlight the potential of neural networks as algorithms and showcase their unique properties compared to traditional algorithms.

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing. Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively, rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm: we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover, the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

The theoretical proof of the existence of such an architecture is provided, highlighting the potential of transformers to learn and implement specific algorithms. Numerical experiments confirm the exact correspondence between the k-means transformer and Lloyd's algorithm, offering a neural implementation of k-means clustering.

arXiv:2506.19125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering: Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next, we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed $k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

Summary:
The article introduces the Riemannian generative decoder, a novel approach in Riemannian representation learning that simplifies manifold constraints by training a decoder network without the need for an encoder. This method, which utilizes a Riemannian optimizer to find manifold-valued maximum likelihood latents, is demonstrated through three case studies: a synthetic branching diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells undergoing a cell division cycle. The results show that the learned representations accurately reflect the specified geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structures. The approach not only simplifies the optimization process but also produces interpretable latent spaces aligned with the data geometry. This method is compatible with existing architectures and offers a promising solution for learning representations on chosen manifolds. <div>

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives, potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds. We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure. Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures, and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10 oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

<div> Keywords: large language models, behavior transfer, residual activation adapter, backpropagation-free, command-V. 

Summary: 
Command-V is a novel method for transferring behaviors from one large language model to another without the need for full finetuning or distillation. It achieves this by copying a residual activation adapter from a donor model and applying it to a recipient model through a backpropagation-free process. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives linear converters between corresponding layers, and transfers the donor intervention to the recipient's activation space. This method requires minimal compute and does not rely on access to the original training data. In case studies focusing on safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic chain-of-thought reasoning, Command-V performs as well as or better than direct finetuning while using significantly less compute. The code and data for Command-V are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute.

<div> Keywords: large language models, interpretability, reasoning processes, attribution methods, thought anchors

Summary:
Reasoning large language models face challenges in interpretability due to their complex chain-of-thought reasoning. This study proposes analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level as a promising approach for understanding the reasoning processes. Three attribution methods are introduced: a black-box method measuring sentence importance, a white-box method identifying broadcasting sentences, and a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences. These methods reveal the presence of thought anchors, which are pivotal reasoning steps that significantly influence subsequent reasoning. The findings suggest that planning or backtracking sentences often act as thought anchors. An open-source tool for visualizing the results of the attribution methods is provided. A case study illustrates how these methods can map a model's multi-step reasoning process, showing consistent patterns across the different analysis techniques. The sentence-level analysis shows promise for gaining deeper insights into reasoning models.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being fine-tuned for specialized domains like medical science. Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing raw data but faces challenges in performance and managing large model sizes. To address this, GradualDiff-Fed is introduced as an FL framework tailored for LLMs, focusing on handling high parameter size by transmitting only model weight differences during training rounds. This approach enhances scalability and communication efficiency, enabling effective fine-tuning of LLMs across distributed clients without performance trade-offs. Evaluation shows that GradualDiff-Fed achieves centralized training-level performance while significantly reducing communication overhead. These findings demonstrate GradualDiff-Fed's potential as an efficient solution for fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings without comprising performance.

arXiv:2506.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then, using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative. Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without requiring tool access at inference.

A private, efficient federated learning algorithm is proposed to learn the shared embedding, ensuring differential privacy and extending utility guarantees to a broader class of users' distributions compared to previous works. An information-theoretic approach in the binary classification setting allows for private learning of the shared embedding with a margin-based accuracy guarantee independent of the data dimension. The method utilizes the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce effective dimensions, demonstrating the possibility of dimension-independent risk bounds under a margin loss. <div>

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where $k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike [CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions). Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin loss.

<br />
Summary: 
The study focuses on training Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with high precision in unbounded domains, specifically for singularity formulation in Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). A modularized approach is proposed, considering neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization algorithm choices. By combining these with computer-assisted proofs and PDE analysis, high-precision numerical solutions from PINNs are shown to be effective for studying PDE singularities. For the 1D Burgers equation, the framework achieves very high precision, while for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which relates to singularities in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, a solution with significantly lower loss compared to previous work is obtained in fewer training steps. Potential directions for achieving machine precision in higher-dimensional problems are also discussed. <div>

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in \cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional problems.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel method for anomaly detection in distributed systems using federated contrastive learning. The approach addresses challenges such as data privacy, node heterogeneity, and anomaly pattern recognition. By combining federated learning and contrastive learning, the method creates embedding representations on local nodes without exposing raw data. It utilizes a global model optimization strategy through federated aggregation and trains the model using both contrastive and classification loss.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space. Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in distributed systems.

Summary:
In this study, the researchers investigate reward hacking in large language models that optimize for a reward model. Reward models, while helpful, can lead to suboptimal results due to their imperfect nature. The phenomenon of reward hacking, where overoptimization for a proxy reward diminishes performance, is explored. The study focuses on Best-of-n, Soft-Best-of-n, and introduces Best-of-Poisson as inference-time mechanisms. It is shown that reward hacking can be mitigated through hedging on the proxy reward, leading to better distortion-reward tradeoffs with minimal computational overhead. An algorithm called HedgeTune is proposed to find the optimal inference-time parameter to counter reward hacking effectively. This study sheds light on the importance of considering the limitations of reward models in optimizing language models for better performance. <div>
arXiv:2506.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance -- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with minimal computational overhead.

Summary: <br />
Behavior Cloning (BC) is a widely used imitation learning technique, but during deployment, measurement errors or disturbances in policy observations can lead to sub-optimal actions. This work proposes using global Lipschitz regularization to enhance the robustness of the learned policy network. The global Lipschitz property provides a robustness certificate to the policy against different perturbations, and a Lipschitz neural network is constructed to ensure policy robustness. Empirical validation across various Gymnasium environments confirms the effectiveness of the approach. The study highlights the importance of considering robustness in Behavior Cloning and demonstrates the benefits of incorporating Lipschitz regularization in neural networks for improved performance in autonomous systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.19250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles. BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances. Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across various environments in Gymnasium.

Summary:
Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification faces challenges such as performance drops in minority classes and sensitivity to structural noise. To address these issues, this study introduces two solutions. Firstly, Constrained Mean Optimization (CMO) enhances minority class performance by promoting similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case scenarios. Secondly, the Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns variable weights to training samples based on local structural consistency to reduce noise impact. The proposed methods are theoretically justified and validated through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant enhancements in Graph OOD generalization and classification accuracy. The code for the approach is available online. <div>

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise. This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2) their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and classification accuracy.

Summary: 
In the study, the focus is on the challenge of preserving temporal continuity in dynamic graphs when using Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches. The research shows that large batch sizes can disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss and making optimization harder by expanding the parameter search space. To address this issue, a new framework called BADGNN is introduced, consisting of Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space expansion and Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to mitigate attention distortion caused by regularization and batching. Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that BADGNN maintains strong performance while allowing for larger batch sizes and faster training compared to the standard TGN model. The research code is available for reference. <div>

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However, Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1) Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem, crucial for relay setting calculation in power systems. With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources, the volatility of operating conditions necessitates an efficient online relay setting calculation strategy. To address this, a novel deep learning-based method, utilizing a parallel graph neural network (PGNN), is proposed in this study. The power system information is structured into four layers and input into the PGNN model for feature extraction. The PGNN method is validated on IEEE test systems with renewable generation units, considering nonlinear fault characteristics. Results demonstrate that the proposed PGNN method outperforms existing methods in accuracy for EOCS problem solving while also significantly reducing online computation time. <div>

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration, heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead, this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems, where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online computation time.

Summary:
Deep state-space models (SSMs) have been gaining popularity in sequence modeling. This paper investigates the impact of depth and width in deep linear SSMs on their expressive capacity. The study finds that increasing depth and width are generally equivalent in terms of expressiveness when there are no parameter constraints. However, under constrained parameter norms, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. It is shown that a deep linear SSM with smaller parameter norms can represent a shallow linear SSM with larger norms through a constructive method. This indicates that deep SSMs are better at representing targets with large norms under norm constraints. Additionally, the paper derives upper bounds on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. Experimental validation of the theoretical results is also provided.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs, how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem. In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our theoretical results with numerical experiments

Summary: 
The paper discusses the vulnerability of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) in detecting False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids. Adversarial attacks, designed FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current Differential Relays (LCDRs). A novel adversarial attack framework using the Fast Gradient Sign Method introduces perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to misclassification of FDIA as a legitimate fault and causing the LCDR to trip. Multiple deep learning models including MLPs, CNNs, LSTMs, and ResNets show high vulnerability to adversarial attacks, with success rates exceeding 99.7%. Adversarial training is introduced as a defense mechanism to enhance model robustness against adversarial FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. The study emphasizes the threat of adversarial attacks on DLS-based FDIA detection in smart grids, highlighting the need for robust cybersecurity measures and the effectiveness of adversarial training in mitigating these threats.

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework, utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models, including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection, underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets, CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to 78.31 AUROC on edema.

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities, emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022) revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%. Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting and support evidence-based policymaking.

Summary:
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE) addresses the limitations of existing graph self-supervised learning methods by considering discrepancies in connected nodes in heterophilic graphs. By reconstructing discrepancy information during masking, DGMAE produces more distinguishable node representations. The results of experiments on 17 benchmark datasets demonstrate DGMAE's effectiveness in preserving node discrepancies in low-dimensional space and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in node classification, node clustering, and graph classification tasks.

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification, demonstrating its remarkable superiority.

Summary:
This paper explores how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures, identifying the appropriate complexity level and inferring corresponding parameters accurately. Transformers exhibit an in-context Bayesian Occam's razor, favoring the least complex sufficient explanation when presented with data from simpler processes. This behavior is theoretically explained through a Bayesian framework, balancing model fit against complexity penalties. The study also investigates the impact of model size, training mixture distribution, inference context length, and architecture on this inductive bias. Additionally, a pretrained GPT-4 model is validated on Boolean-function tasks, showcasing the inherent Occam's razor-like inductive bias in transformers trained on diverse task distributions. <div>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution, inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on diverse task distributions.

Summary:
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS) is introduced as a novel method for electromagnetic structure design. PQS converts the design space into a hierarchical representation, allowing for a progressive search from global patterns to local details. A consistency-driven sample selection mechanism is implemented to balance exploitation and exploration in candidate design selection. The method is evaluated on Dual-layer Frequency Selective Surface and High-gain Antenna tasks, showcasing its ability to achieve satisfactory designs within limited computational budgets. Experimental results demonstrate that PQS outperforms baseline methods, reducing evaluation costs by 75-85% and saving valuable time in the product designing cycle, effectively improving efficiency in engineering tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product designing cycle.

Summary: <br />
Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) provide a method to solve complex PDEs, but increasing the number of Fourier modes for handling more complex PDEs leads to a high number of model parameters and computationally impractical hyperparameter tuning. The $\mu$Transfer-FNO technique addresses this issue by enabling the transfer of optimal hyperparameters from smaller FNOs to billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Through the $\mu$P framework, a parametrization scheme allows for the transfer of hyperparameters across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs. This approach is validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs, showing that Transfer-FNO reduces computational costs for tuning hyperparameters on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce $\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Summary: 
The article presents a novel framework called the Focusing Influence Mechanism (FIM) to improve cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning under sparse rewards. Inspired by military theory, FIM directs agent influence towards task-critical elements known as Center of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions. It achieves this through identifying these dimensions, designing intrinsic rewards to focus influence, and encouraging persistent focus through credit accumulation. FIM enables agents to induce targeted state transitions, enhancing cooperation in challenging environments with sparse rewards. Empirical evaluations on various MARL benchmarks show that FIM consistently boosts cooperative performance compared to existing methods. <div>
arXiv:2506.19417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory. FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3) encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative performance compared to baselines.

<div> Keywords: causal discovery, tag-based approach, type assignments, causal relations, variable relations

Summary: 
In the study, a new approach to causal discovery is introduced, focusing on the different causal relations between variables. By assigning multiple tags to each variable in a causal graph, the proposed tag-based method enhances causal discovery by leveraging edge relations between tags. This method improves upon traditional type-based relations, which can be restrictive and lack flexibility. Results from experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in boosting causal discovery accuracy. The high-level tag relations derived from the method align well with existing knowledge. This innovative approach offers a more robust and flexible way to uncover causal relationships between variables, ultimately contributing to the advancement of causal discovery techniques. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit common knowledge.

Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo environments.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN, a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark (113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance, establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code is available at https://github.com/GLAD-RUC/DistEGNN.

<div> Machine Unlearning, Vulnerabilities, Privacy Breaches, Membership Recall Attack, Learning with Noisy Labels <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces the concept of Machine Unlearning (MU) technology, which allows the removal of specific data instances from trained models. However, vulnerabilities in MU technology could lead to privacy breaches if ostensibly unlearned information leaks. To address this concern, the researchers propose a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework that can recall forgotten class memberships from unlearned models (ULMs) without accessing the original models. The MRA framework uses a teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture, treating ULMs as noisy labelers to transfer knowledge to student models. This approach transforms the problem into a Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) challenge, enabling the inference of correct labels for the forgotten instances. Experimental results on multiple real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the MRA strategy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances, establishing a benchmark for future research on MU vulnerabilities. <div>

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored, posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result, our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU vulnerabilities.

The study introduces a new framework called COLUR for restoring and refining deep learning models that have been degraded by noisy label data. Inspired by the "forgetting mechanism" in neuroscience, COLUR uses a co-training architecture to unlearn the influence of label noise and refine model confidence for relearning. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that COLUR consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods after model restoration and refinement. This approach shows promise in improving model performance in situations where noisy labels result in degraded model performance. <div>
arXiv:2506.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data. Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning. Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA methods after MRR.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenge of finding valid substitutions in symbolic regression problems where solutions are expressions composed of input variables and function symbols. As formulas become more complex, finding proper substitutions becomes crucial. The authors introduce an iterative dimension reduction procedure that searches for small substitutions in the expression space and tests for validity based on functional dependence. This approach effectively reduces the number of variables in the formula, improving the performance of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms. The procedure reliably identifies valid substitutions, enhancing the algorithms' ability to recover formulae from finite samples. By exploiting fixed combinations of variables commonly found in natural formulas, this method provides a systematic way to optimize symbolic regression processes. <div>
arXiv:2506.19537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger. Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables. However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

<div> Hyperparameter optimization, generalization error, overfitting, validation error, resampling strategy <br />
Summary:<br />
The article explores the concept of overtuning in hyperparameter optimization (HPO), where excessive optimization of validation error can lead to overfitting at the HPO level. Overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO, is investigated through a large-scale reanalysis of HPO benchmark data. The study shows that overtuning is more common than previously thought, with approximately 10% of cases resulting in the selection of a seemingly optimal hyperparameter configuration that performs worse than the default or initial configuration. Factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset size, learning algorithm, and HPO method play a role in overtuning severity. The findings emphasize the importance of addressing overtuning in HPO, particularly in the context of small data sets, and suggest the need for further research on mitigation strategies. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases, overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further mitigation strategies should be studied.

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel approach, the ConCM framework, for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL). It addresses the limitations of existing space construction methods by optimizing feature-structure dual consistency. Inspired by hippocampal associative memory, the framework includes memory-aware prototype calibration to enhance feature consistency across classes. Additionally, dynamic structure matching aligns features to an optimal manifold space for cross-session structure consistency. The method overcomes the need for class-number priors and achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale FSCIL benchmarks, surpassing current optimal methods. <div>

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM) that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL. Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

<div> Keywords: multi-task learning, few-shot learning, time series forecasting, meta-learning, personalized forecasting

Summary:
The Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF) addresses challenges in multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting by incorporating the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), Task-Specific Module (TSM), and Rank Module (RM). During training, the GKM extracts generalized features across tasks, while the TSM captures task-specific dynamics. The RM selects the most relevant features for accurate forecasts during testing. FAF outperforms traditional methods on real-world datasets, achieving a 41.81% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO2 emissions dataset. FAF demonstrates the effectiveness of personalized forecasting even with limited historical data through its innovative design.

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges, we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase, the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions, each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a 41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$ emissions dataset.

<div> dataset, quasi-isodynamic stellarator, optimization benchmarks, machine learning, fusion energy

Summary:
The article introduces an open dataset of quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarator plasma boundary shapes paired with ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance metrics. It includes three optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity for stellarator design. The benchmarks range from a basic geometric optimization problem to a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator exploring trade-offs between compactness and coil simplicity. Reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical optimization techniques are provided for each benchmark. The dataset allows for the training of models that can generate novel and feasible configurations without expensive physics simulations. By releasing this dataset along with benchmark problems and baselines, the aim is to make stellarator design more accessible to optimization and machine learning researchers and accelerate progress towards achieving fusion energy on the grid. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes, paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3) a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to the grid.

<title>Training Flexible Models of Genetic Variant Effects from Functional Annotations using Accelerated Linear Algebra</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19598</link>

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes -- traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions, potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target identification.

<title>Beyond Static Models: Hypernetworks for Adaptive and Generalizable Forecasting in Complex Parametric Dynamical Systems</title>

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks (PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is, expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data sets.

<title>Why Uncertainty Calibration Matters for Reliable Perturbation-based Explanations</title>

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual object locations.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse and fine temporal scales is crucial for profit-optimized decision-making in several business applications, and remains an open research problem in temporal hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5 dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer model.

<title>Unsupervised Data Generation for Offline Reinforcement Learning: A Perspective from Model</title>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL. Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy. Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with tensor-parallelism requires substantial communication to synchronize activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations, reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for Tensor-parallelism" (CAAT-Net). We train 1B and 7B parameter CAAT-Net models, with a 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication and no significant drop in pretraining accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CAAT-Net accelerates both training and inference workloads.

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features, often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant. These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training. Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at: https://github.com/Mihneaghitu/ModelGuidanceViaRobustFeatureAttribution.

<title>When Can We Reuse a Calibration Set for Multiple Conformal Predictions?</title>

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly available.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme, ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83% over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public repository.

<title>Outlier-Safe Pre-Training for Robust 4-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment. While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection, redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive 4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10 benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2% training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis (0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Outlier-Safe-Pre-Training.

<title>Learning-aided Bigraph Matching Approach to Multi-Crew Restoration of Damaged Power Networks Coupled with Road Transportation Networks</title>

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions, such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained. Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.

<title>Guidance in the Frequency Domain Enables High-Fidelity Sampling at Low CFG Scales</title>

arXiv:2506.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically, low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance (FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG, establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard classifier-free guidance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures, offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty quantification in deep learning.

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP, attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units, MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs. Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting, editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

<title>DRIFT: Data Reduction via Informative Feature Transformation- Generalization Begins Before Deep Learning starts</title>

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably, DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

<title>Noise Consistency Training: A Native Approach for One-Step Generator in Learning Additional Controls</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency, adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints, semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge. Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular, data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass, surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.

<title>On the necessity of adaptive regularisation:Optimal anytime online learning on $\boldsymbol{\ell_p}$-balls</title>

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes. Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary, and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all $\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

<title>Cross-regularization: Adaptive Model Complexity through Validation Gradients</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19755</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.19755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple gradient-based approach.

<title>Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO for Dynamic Preference Alignment</title>

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision. Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss. However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However, constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower value.

arXiv:2506.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular, this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems, recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts, who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art curators.

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes "emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment, we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior. Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples efficiently restores alignment.

<title>Scaling Speculative Decoding with Lookahead Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD) helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire $\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step, and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching. In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional GPU throughput. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/LookaheadReasoning

<title>Orthogonal Finetuning Made Scalable</title>

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

Abstract: Modern cyberattacks in cyber-physical systems (CPS) rapidly evolve and cannot be deterred effectively with most current methods which focused on characterizing past threats. Adaptive anomaly detection (AAD) is among the most promising techniques to detect evolving cyberattacks focused on fast data processing and model adaptation. AAD has been researched in the literature extensively; however, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic literature review (SLR) on the current research within this field. We present a comprehensive SLR, gathering 397 relevant papers and systematically analyzing 65 of them (47 research and 18 survey papers) on AAD in CPS studies from 2013 to 2023 (November). We introduce a novel taxonomy considering attack types, CPS application, learning paradigm, data management, and algorithms. Our analysis indicates, among other findings, that reviewed works focused on a single aspect of adaptation (either data processing or model adaptation) but rarely in both at the same time. We aim to help researchers to advance the state of the art and help practitioners to become familiar with recent progress in this field. We identify the limitations of the state of the art and provide recommendations for future research directions.

Abstract: Particle physics theories, such as those which explain neutrino flavor mixing, arise from a vast landscape of model-building possibilities. A model's construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data. We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups, particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning with physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical model-building problems in the future.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society. Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012. However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes, learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture - Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space. This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

arXiv:2506.18954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a sound source localization (SSL) technique that combines an $\alpha$-stable model for the observed signal with a neural network-based approach for modeling steering vectors. Specifically, a physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound sources.

<title>A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap</title>

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff, where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model, initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation, now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount. Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

Abstract: Information retrieval is a cornerstone of modern knowledge acquisition, enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However, traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources, including industry products, research papers, benchmark datasets, and open-source implementations, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DavidZWZ/Awesome-Deep-Research.

Recently, this analysis has incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption, developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study 2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking method.

Abstract: In many applications of optimal transport (OT), the object of primary interest is the optimal transport map. This map rearranges mass from one probability distribution to another in the most efficient way possible by minimizing a specified cost. In this paper we review recent advances in estimating and developing limit theorems for the OT map, using samples from the underlying distributions. We also review parallel lines of work that establish similar results for special cases and variants of the basic OT setup. We conclude with a discussion of key directions for future research with the goal of providing practitioners with reliable inferential tools.

<title>When Diffusion Models Memorize: Inductive Biases in Probability Flow of Minimum-Norm Shallow Neural Nets</title>

Abstract: While diffusion models generate high-quality images via probability flow, the theoretical understanding of this process remains incomplete. A key question is when probability flow converges to training samples or more general points on the data manifold. We analyze this by studying the probability flow of shallow ReLU neural network denoisers trained with minimal $\ell^2$ norm. For intuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal datasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training point or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion time scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points. This reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training samples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples, motivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these results to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case, confirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training points, or a manifold point. Moreover, memorization decreases when the number of training samples grows, as fewer samples accumulate near training points.

<title>Plan for Speed -- Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores. Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches (e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks - domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

<title>Online Learning for Dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Mechanism in Sequential Auctions under Unknown Environments</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient, truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.

Abstract: Uplift modeling has achieved significant success in various fields, particularly in online marketing. It is a method that primarily utilizes machine learning and deep learning to estimate individual treatment effects. This paper we apply uplift modeling to analyze the effect of company adjustment on their financial status, and we treat these adjustment as treatments or interventions in this study. Although there have been extensive studies and application regarding binary treatments, multiple treatments, and continuous treatments, company adjustment are often more complex than these scenarios, as they constitute a series of multiple time-dependent actions. The effect estimation of company adjustment needs to take into account not only individual treatment traits but also the temporal order of this series of treatments. This study collects a real-world data set about company financial statements and reported behavior in Luxembourg for the experiments. First, we use two meta-learners and three other well-known uplift models to analyze different company adjustment by simplifying the adjustment as binary treatments. Furthermore, we propose a new uplift modeling framework (MTDnet) to address the time-dependent nature of these adjustment, and the experimental result shows the necessity of considering the timing of these adjustment.

<title>First-Order Sparse Convex Optimization: Better Rates with Sparse Updates</title>

Abstract: In was recently established that for convex optimization problems with a sparse optimal solution (may it be entry-wise sparsity or matrix rank-wise sparsity) it is possible to have linear convergence rates which depend on an improved mixed-norm condition number of the form $\frac{\beta_1{}s}{\alpha_2}$, where $\beta_1$ is the $\ell_1$-Lipchitz continuity constant of the gradient, $\alpha_2$ is the $\ell_2$-quadratic growth constant, and $s$ is the sparsity of the optimal solution. However, beyond the improved convergence rate, these methods are unable to leverage the sparsity of optimal solutions towards improving also the runtime of each iteration, which may still be prohibitively high for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we establish that linear convergence rates which depend on this improved condition number can be obtained using only sparse updates, which may result in overall significantly improved running times. Moreover, our methods are considerably easier to implement.

<title>CUPID: Curating Data your Robot Loves with Influence Functions</title>

Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore, hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the post-training of generalist robot policies.

Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges. First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second, the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128 channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly, predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.

Abstract: This work establishes that sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal posterior contraction rates over anisotropic Besov spaces and their hierarchical compositions. These structures reflect the intrinsic dimensionality of the underlying function, thereby mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Our analysis shows that Bayesian neural networks equipped with either sparse or continuous shrinkage priors attain the optimal rates which are dependent on the intrinsic dimension of the true structures. Moreover, we show that these priors enable rate adaptation, allowing the posterior to contract at the optimal rate even when the smoothness level of the true function is unknown. The proposed framework accommodates a broad class of functions, including additive and multiplicative Besov functions as special cases. These results advance the theoretical foundations of Bayesian neural networks and provide rigorous justification for their practical effectiveness in high-dimensional, structured estimation problems.

<title>A Deep Learning Based Method for Fast Registration of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images</title>

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings, it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric, strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

Abstract: The growing reliance on power electronics introduces new challenges requiring detailed time-domain analyses with fast and accurate circuit simulation tools. Currently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on physics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that data-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed with limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before deployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network (BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc boost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A physics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also trained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using step-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of accuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform the FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median RMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than the FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the proposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or data-driven methods for power electronics simulations.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability. This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality assessment from life narratives.

Abstract: Federated learning systems increasingly rely on diverse network topologies to address scalability and organizational constraints. While existing privacy research focuses on gradient-based attacks, the privacy implications of network topology knowledge remain critically understudied. We conduct the first comprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic adversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying degrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns even under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic evaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial knowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge configurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three complementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter magnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success rates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions. Critically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain attack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge configurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete knowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and empirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense mechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional attack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques. These results establish that network topology represents a fundamental privacy vulnerability in federated learning systems while providing practical pathways for mitigation through topology-aware defense mechanisms.

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse, where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance. Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

Abstract: We present HARPT, a large-scale annotated corpus of mobile health app store reviews aimed at advancing research in user privacy and trust. The dataset comprises over 480,000 user reviews labeled into seven categories that capture critical aspects of trust in applications, trust in providers and privacy concerns. Creating HARPT required addressing multiple complexities, such as defining a nuanced label schema, isolating relevant content from large volumes of noisy data, and designing an annotation strategy that balanced scalability with accuracy. This strategy integrated rule-based filtering, iterative manual labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using transformer-based classifiers to accelerate coverage. In parallel, a carefully curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support model development and evaluation. We benchmark a broad range of classification models, demonstrating that strong performance is achievable and providing a baseline for future research. HARPT is released as a public resource to support work in health informatics, cybersecurity, and natural language processing.

Abstract: The generation and preservation of complex quantum states against environmental noise are paramount challenges in advancing continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing. This paper introduces a novel framework based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable, parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model (CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states, particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation. Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states. Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its potential as a robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation in realistic CV quantum systems.

Abstract: A long-standing obstacle in the use of machine-learnt surrogates with larger PDE systems is the onset of instabilities when solved numerically. Efforts towards ameliorating these have mostly concentrated on improving the accuracy of the surrogates or imbuing them with additional structure, and have garnered limited success. In this article, we study a prototype problem and draw insights that can help with more complex systems. In particular, we focus on a viscous Burgers'-ML system and, after identifying the cause of the instabilities, prescribe strategies to stabilize the coupled system. To improve the accuracy of the stabilized system, we next explore methods based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism.

Abstract: Efficiently embedding high-dimensional datasets onto noisy and low-qubit quantum systems is a significant barrier to practical Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Approaches such as quantum autoencoders can be constrained by current hardware capabilities and may exhibit vulnerabilities to reconstruction attacks due to their invertibility. We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis (qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and qubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs inherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves the neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent space, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We derive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding onto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 show that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and hybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML classification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines. Initial tests on real hardware and noisy simulators confirm its potential for noise-resilient performance, offering a scalable solution for advancing QML applications.

<title>Rare dense solutions clusters in asymmetric binary perceptrons -- local entropy via fully lifted RDT</title>

Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated \emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness. Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance (\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete defragmentation.
  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade, sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

<title>CAM-NET: An AI Model for Whole Atmosphere with Thermosphere and Ionosphere Extension</title>

Abstract: We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds, temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and generalization capabilities.

<title>WebGuard++:Interpretable Malicious URL Detection via Bidirectional Fusion of HTML Subgraphs and Multi-Scale Convolutional BERT</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19356</link>

Abstract: URL+HTML feature fusion shows promise for robust malicious URL detection, since attacker artifacts persist in DOM structures. However, prior work suffers from four critical shortcomings: (1) incomplete URL modeling, failing to jointly capture lexical patterns and semantic context; (2) HTML graph sparsity, where threat-indicative nodes (e.g., obfuscated scripts) are isolated amid benign content, causing signal dilution during graph aggregation; (3) unidirectional analysis, ignoring URL-HTML feature bidirectional interaction; and (4) opaque decisions, lacking attribution to malicious DOM components. To address these challenges, we present WebGuard++, a detection framework with 4 novel components: 1) Cross-scale URL Encoder: Hierarchically learns local-to-global and coarse to fine URL features based on Transformer network with dynamic convolution. 2) Subgraph-aware HTML Encoder: Decomposes DOM graphs into interpretable substructures, amplifying sparse threat signals via Hierarchical feature fusion. 3) Bidirectional Coupling Module: Aligns URL and HTML embeddings through cross-modal contrastive learning, optimizing inter-modal consistency and intra-modal specificity. 4) Voting Module: Localizes malicious regions through consensus voting on malicious subgraph predictions. Experiments show WebGuard++ achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 1.1x-7.9x higher TPR at fixed FPR of 0.001 and 0.0001 across both datasets.

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features, conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

<title>Low-Complexity Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Lookahead Search</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19451</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity. Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity, demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns, limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data. Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets, enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11% reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a 10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real training sets are not available.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution, resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator. As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph (TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct, ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of 49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture. Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of 2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models (Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain orchestration.

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs. Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description. MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/Multi-Agent-MATE.

<title>Visual hallucination detection in large vision-language models via evidential conflict</title>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective, overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset, which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances, scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5, mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics, achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks, causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR) systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1) detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network, where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat) with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56% accuracy.

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization (RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments, and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications: (i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii) Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering, summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution performance without any model retraining.

<title>General Methods Make Great Domain-specific Foundation Models: A Case-study on Fetal Ultrasound</title>

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2 method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification, segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models (VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations. Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for embodied agents in real-world settings.

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT), to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR, effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from configurational samples.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

Abstract: Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO) interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP & OLAP workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and eventually consistent systems.

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view, assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions, including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

<title>Near-optimal estimates for the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of deep random ReLU neural networks</title>

Abstract: This paper studies the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of ReLU neural networks $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with random parameters for $p \in [1,\infty]$. The distribution of the weights follows a variant of the He initialization and the biases are drawn from symmetric distributions. We derive high probability upper and lower bounds for wide networks that differ at most by a factor that is logarithmic in the network's width and linear in its depth. In the special case of shallow networks, we obtain matching bounds. Remarkably, the behavior of the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant varies significantly between the regimes $ p \in [1,2) $ and $ p \in [2,\infty] $. For $p \in [2,\infty]$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant behaves similarly to $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}$, where $g \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vector and $1/p + 1/p' = 1$. In contrast, for $p \in [1,2)$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant aligns more closely to $\Vert g \Vert_{2}$.

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) refers to the task of optimizing a black-box objective function using only a fixed set of prior input-output data, without any active experimentation. Recent work has introduced quantum extremal learning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum circuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data points. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning literature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in unexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In this paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM) - a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on out-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on the expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding generalization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark optimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with higher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its superiority for offline design problems.

Abstract: Understanding temporal patterns in online search behavior is crucial for real-time marketing and trend forecasting. Google Trends offers a rich proxy for public interest, yet the high dimensionality and noise of its time-series data present challenges for effective clustering. This study evaluates three unsupervised clustering approaches, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), enhanced SAX (eSAX), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), applied to 20 Google Trends keywords representing major consumer categories. Our results show that while SAX and eSAX offer fast and interpretable clustering for stable time series, they struggle with volatility and complexity, often producing ambiguous ``catch-all'' clusters. TDA, by contrast, captures global structural features through persistent homology and achieves more balanced and meaningful groupings.
  We conclude with practical guidance for using symbolic and topological methods in consumer analytics and suggest that hybrid approaches combining both perspectives hold strong potential for future applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Abstract: Predicting the probability of default (PD) of prospective loans is a critical objective for financial institutions. In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have achieved remarkable success across a wide variety of prediction tasks; yet, they remain relatively underutilised in credit risk analysis. This paper highlights the opportunities that ML algorithms offer to this field by comparing the performance of five predictive models-Random Forests, Decision Trees, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost-to the predominantly used logistic regression, over a benchmark dataset from Scheule et al. (Credit Risk Analytics: The R Companion). Our findings underscore the strengths and weaknesses of each method, providing valuable insights into the most effective ML algorithms for PD prediction in the context of loan portfolios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

Abstract: We develop ProxelGen, a protein structure generative model that operates on 3D densities as opposed to the prevailing 3D point cloud representations. Representing proteins as voxelized densities, or proxels, enables new tasks and conditioning capabilities. We generate proteins encoded as proxels via a 3D CNN-based VAE in conjunction with a diffusion model operating on its latent space. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProxelGen's samples achieve higher novelty, better FID scores, and the same level of designability as the training set. ProxelGen's advantages are demonstrated in a standard motif scaffolding benchmark, and we show how 3D density-based generation allows for more flexible shape conditioning.

Abstract: Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular conformations.

<title>Machine Learning with Privacy for Protected Attributes</title>

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become the standard for private data analysis. Certain machine learning applications only require privacy protection for specific protected attributes. Using naive variants of differential privacy in such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work, we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a training image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a new approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of DP while still providing strong privacy guarantees.

<title>Convergence of Mean Shift Algorithms for Large Bandwidths and Simultaneous Accurate Clustering</title>

Abstract: The mean shift (MS) is a non-parametric, density-based, iterative algorithm that has prominent usage in clustering and image segmentation. A rigorous proof for its convergence in full generality remains unknown. Two significant steps in this direction were taken in the paper \cite{Gh1}, which proved that for \textit{sufficiently large bandwidth}, the MS algorithm with the Gaussian kernel always converges in any dimension, and also by the same author in \cite{Gh2}, proved that MS always converges in one dimension for kernels with differentiable, strictly decreasing, convex profiles. In the more recent paper \cite{YT}, they have proved the convergence in more generality,\textit{ without any restriction on the bandwidth}, with the assumption that the KDE $f$ has a continuous Lipschitz gradient on the closure of the convex hull of the trajectory of the iterated sequence of the mode estimate, and also satisfies the {\L}ojasiewicz property there.
  The main theoretical result of this paper is a generalization of those of \cite{Gh1}, where we show that (1) for\textit{ sufficiently large bandwidth} convergence is guaranteed in any dimension with \textit{any radially symmetric and strictly positive definite kernels}. The proof uses two alternate characterizations of radially symmetric positive definite smooth kernels by Schoenberg and Bernstein \cite{Fass}, and borrows some steps from the proofs in \cite{Gh1}. Although the authors acknowledge that the result in that paper is more restrictive than that of \cite{YT} due to the lower bandwidth limit, it uses a different set of assumptions than \cite{YT}, and the proof technique is different.

Abstract: We study NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation Free Network), a simple and efficient deep learning baseline for image restoration. By using CIFAR10 images corrupted with noise and blur, we conduct an ablation study of NAFNet's core components. Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM) and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance. Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention, while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future work.

<title>Radial Attention: $O(n\log n)$ Sparse Attention with Energy Decay for Long Video Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce novel Twin Parametric Margin Support Vector Machine (TPMSVM) models designed to address multiclass classification tasks under feature uncertainty. To handle data perturbations, we construct bounded-by-norm uncertainty set around each training observation and derive the robust counterparts of the deterministic models using robust optimization techniques. To capture complex data structure, we explore both linear and kernel-induced classifiers, providing computationally tractable reformulations of the resulting robust models. Additionally, we propose two alternatives for the final decision function, enhancing models' flexibility. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed robust multiclass TPMSVM methodology on real-world datasets, showing the good performance of the approach in the presence of uncertainty.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL), which differentiates through the KKT conditions, has recently emerged as a powerful approach for predict-then-optimize problems. However, under probabilistic settings, DFL faces three major bottlenecks: model mismatch error, sample average approximation error, and gradient approximation error. Model mismatch error stems from the misalignment between the model's parameterized predictive distribution and the true probability distribution. Sample average approximation error arises when using finite samples to approximate the expected optimization objective. Gradient approximation error occurs when the objectives are non-convex and KKT conditions cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we present DF2, the first distribution-free decision-focused learning method designed to mitigate these three bottlenecks. Rather than depending on a task-specific forecaster that requires precise model assumptions, our method directly learns the expected optimization function during training. To efficiently learn this function in a data-driven manner, we devise an attention-based model architecture inspired by the distribution-based parameterization of the expected objective. We evaluate DF2 on two synthetic problems and three real-world problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of DF2. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Lingkai-Kong/DF2.

Abstract: Self-attributing neural networks (SANNs) present a potential path towards interpretable models for high-dimensional problems, but often face significant trade-offs in performance. In this work, we formally prove a lower bound on errors of per-feature SANNs, whereas group-based SANNs can achieve zero error and thus high performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose Sum-of-Parts (SOP), a framework that transforms any differentiable model into a group-based SANN, where feature groups are learned end-to-end without group supervision. SOP achieves state-of-the-art performance for SANNs on vision and language tasks, and we validate that the groups are interpretable on a range of quantitative and semantic metrics. We further validate the utility of SOP explanations in model debugging and cosmological scientific discovery. Our code is available at https://github.com/BrachioLab/sop

Abstract: We propose a method to generate statistically representative synthetic data from a given dataset. The main goal of our method is for the created data set to mimic the inter--feature correlations present in the original data, while also offering a tunable parameter to influence the privacy level. In particular, our method constructs a statistical map by using the empirical conditional distributions between the features of the original dataset. Part of the tunability is achieved by limiting the depths of conditional distributions that are being used. We describe in detail our algorithms used both in the construction of a statistical map and how to use this map to generate synthetic observations. This approach is tested in three different ways: with a hand calculated example; a manufactured dataset; and a real world energy-related dataset of consumption/production of households in Madeira Island. We evaluate the method by comparing the datasets using the Pearson correlation matrix with different levels of resolution and depths of correlation. These two considerations are being viewed as tunable parameters influencing the resulting datasets fidelity and privacy. The proposed methodology is general in the sense that it does not rely on the used test dataset. We expect it to be applicable in a much broader context than indicated here.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently experienced remarkable advances, fueled by large models, vast datasets, accelerated hardware, and, last but not least, the transformative power of differentiable programming. This new programming paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm, differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models, optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the differentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs intended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherently introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to quantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.

Abstract: We propose two algorithms for boosting random Fourier feature models for approximating high-dimensional functions. These methods utilize the classical and generalized analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition to learn low-order functions, where there are few interactions between the variables. Our algorithms are able to find an index set of important input variables and variable interactions reliably. Furthermore, we generalize already existing random Fourier feature models to an ANOVA setting, where terms of different order can be used. Our algorithms have the advantage of interpretability, meaning that the influence of every input variable is known in the learned model, even for dependent input variables. We give theoretical as well as numerical results that our algorithms perform well for sensitivity analysis. The ANOVA-boosting step reduces the approximation error of existing methods significantly.

Abstract: Graphical models have demonstrated their exceptional capabilities across numerous applications, such as social networks, citation networks, and online recommendation systems. However, their performance, confidence, and trustworthiness are often limited by the inherent randomness in data and the challenges of accurately modeling real-world complexities. There has been increased interest in developing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques tailored to graphical models. In this survey, we comprehensively examine existing works on UQ for graphical models, focusing on key aspects such as the sources, representation, handling, and evaluation of uncertainty. This survey distinguishes itself from most existing UQ surveys by specifically concentrating on UQ in graphical models, including probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). After reviewing sources of uncertainty, we organize the work using two high-level dimensions: uncertainty representation and uncertainty handling. By offering a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, including both established methodologies and emerging trends, we aim to bridge gaps in understanding key challenges and opportunities in UQ for graphical models, hoping to inspire researchers working on graphical models or uncertainty quantification to make further advancements at the cross of the two fields.

Abstract: Clustering nodes in heterophilous graphs is challenging as traditional methods assume that effective clustering is characterized by high intra-cluster and low inter-cluster connectivity. To address this, we introduce HeNCler-a novel approach for Heterophilous Node Clustering. HeNCler learns a similarity graph by optimizing a clustering-specific objective based on weighted kernel singular value decomposition. Our approach enables spectral clustering on an asymmetric similarity graph, providing flexibility for both directed and undirected graphs. By solving the primal problem directly, our method overcomes the computational difficulties of traditional adjacency partitioning-based approaches. Experimental results show that HeNCler significantly improves node clustering performance in heterophilous graph settings, highlighting the advantage of its asymmetric graph-learning framework.

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning (MML) is rapidly reshaping the way mental-health disorders are detected, characterized, and longitudinally monitored. Whereas early studies relied on isolated data streams -- such as speech, text, or wearable signals -- recent research has converged on architectures that integrate heterogeneous modalities to capture the rich, complex signatures of psychiatric conditions. This survey provides the first comprehensive, clinically grounded synthesis of MML for mental health. We (i) catalog 26 public datasets spanning audio, visual, physiological signals, and text modalities; (ii) systematically compare transformer, graph, and hybrid-based fusion strategies across 28 models, highlighting trends in representation learning and cross-modal alignment. Beyond summarizing current capabilities, we interrogate open challenges: data governance and privacy, demographic and intersectional fairness, evaluation explainability, and the complexity of mental health disorders in multimodal settings. By bridging methodological innovation with psychiatric utility, this survey aims to orient both ML researchers and mental-health practitioners toward the next generation of trustworthy, multimodal decision-support systems.

Abstract: Disease progression models infer group-level temporal trajectories of change in patients' features as a chronic degenerative condition plays out. They provide unique insight into disease biology and staging systems with individual-level clinical utility. Discrete models consider disease progression as a latent permutation of events, where each event corresponds to a feature becoming measurably abnormal. However, permutation inference using traditional maximum likelihood approaches becomes prohibitive due to combinatoric explosion, severely limiting model dimensionality and utility. Here we leverage ideas from optimal transport to model disease progression as a latent permutation matrix of events belonging to the Birkhoff polytope, facilitating fast inference via optimisation of the variational lower bound. This enables a factor of 1000 times faster inference than the current state of the art and, correspondingly, supports models with several orders of magnitude more features than the current state of the art can consider. Experiments demonstrate the increase in speed, accuracy and robustness to noise in simulation. Further experiments with real-world imaging data from two separate datasets, one from Alzheimer's disease patients, the other age-related macular degeneration, showcase, for the first time, pixel-level disease progression events in the brain and eye, respectively. Our method is low compute, interpretable and applicable to any progressive condition and data modality, giving it broad potential clinical utility.

Abstract: One of the biggest challenges of building artificial intelligence (AI) model in the healthcare area is the data sharing. Since healthcare data is private, sensitive, and heterogeneous, collecting sufficient data for modelling is exhausting, costly, and sometimes impossible. In this paper, we propose a framework for global healthcare modelling using datasets from multi-continents (Europe, North America, and Asia) without sharing the local datasets, and choose glucose management as a study model to verify its effectiveness. Technically, blockchain-enabled federated learning is implemented with adaptation to meet the privacy and safety requirements of healthcare data, meanwhile, it rewards honest participation and penalizes malicious activities using its on-chain incentive mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective, efficient, and privacy-preserving. Its prediction accuracy consistently outperforms models trained on limited personal data and achieves comparable or even slightly better results than centralized training in certain scenarios, all while preserving data privacy. This work paves the way for international collaborations on healthcare projects, where additional data is crucial for reducing bias and providing benefits to humanity.

Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in mathematics, enabling one to identify subtle patterns across collections of examples so vast that they would be impossible for a single researcher to feasibly review and analyze. In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \emph{quiver mutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of \emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently discover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\tilde{D}$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and parsimonious rules from mathematical data.

Abstract: One of the core pillars of efficient deep learning methods is architectural improvements such as the residual/skip connection, which has led to significantly better model convergence and quality. Since then the residual connection has become ubiquitous in not just convolutional neural networks but also transformer-based architectures, the backbone of LLMs.
  In this paper we introduce Learned Augmented Residual Layer (LAuReL) -- a novel generalization of the canonical residual connection -- with the goal to be an in-situ replacement of the latter while outperforming on both model quality and footprint metrics. Our experiments show that using LAuReL can help boost performance for both vision and language models. For example, on the ResNet-50, ImageNet 1K task, it achieves 60% of the gains from adding an extra layer, while only adding 0.003% more parameters, and matches it while adding 2.6 times fewer parameters. Similarly, when pre-training 1B and 4B parameter LLMs, LAuReL improves performance on a variety of challenging downstream evaluation tasks by 2.54% to 20.05%, while adding only 0.012% and 0.1% additional parameters, respectively.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM. We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible, training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world applications.

Abstract: Access to large-scale high-quality healthcare databases is key to accelerate medical research and make insightful discoveries about diseases. However, access to such data is often limited by patient privacy concerns, data sharing restrictions and high costs. To overcome these limitations, synthetic patient data has emerged as an alternative. However, synthetic data generation (SDG) methods typically rely on machine learning (ML) models trained on original data, leading back to the data scarcity problem. We propose an approach to generate synthetic tabular patient data that does not require access to the original data, but only a description of the desired database. We leverage prior medical knowledge and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic patient data, even in a low-resource setting. We quantitatively evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art SDG models, using fidelity, privacy, and utility metrics. Our results show that while LLMs may not match the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on the original data, they effectively generate realistic patient data with well-preserved clinical correlations. An ablation study highlights key elements of our prompt contributing to high-quality synthetic patient data generation. This approach, which is easy to use and does not require original data or advanced ML skills, is particularly valuable for quickly generating custom-designed patient data, supporting project implementation and providing educational resources.

Abstract: Quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently gained popularity, particularly for on-device settings with limited hardware resources. While efficient, quantization inevitably degrades model quality, especially in aggressive low-bit settings such as 3-bit and 4-bit precision. In this paper, we propose DecDEC, an inference scheme that improves the quality of low-bit LLMs while preserving the key benefits of quantization: GPU memory savings and latency reduction. DecDEC stores the residual matrix -- the difference between full-precision and quantized weights -- in CPU, and dynamically fetches the residuals for only a small portion of the weights. This portion corresponds to the salient channels, marked by activation outliers, with the fetched residuals helping to correct quantization errors in these channels. Salient channels are identified dynamically at each decoding step by analyzing the input activations -- this enables adaptation to the dynamic nature of activation distribution, thus maximizing the effectiveness of error compensation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecDEC by augmenting state-of-the-art quantization methods. For example, DecDEC reduces the perplexity of a 3-bit Llama-3-8B-Instruct model from 10.15 to 9.12 -- outperforming its 3.5-bit counterpart -- while adding less than 0.0003\% to GPU memory usage and incurring only a 1.7\% inference slowdown on NVIDIA RTX 4050 Mobile.

Abstract: Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on high-resolution images is often bottlenecked by the cost of evaluating gradients of the loss on the finest spatial mesh. To address this, we propose Multiscale Gradient Estimation (MGE), a Multilevel Monte Carlo-inspired estimator that expresses the expected gradient on the finest mesh as a telescopic sum of gradients computed on progressively coarser meshes. By assigning larger batches to the cheaper coarse levels, MGE achieves the same variance as single-scale stochastic gradient estimation while reducing the number of fine mesh convolutions by a factor of 4 with each downsampling. We further embed MGE within a Full-Multiscale training algorithm that solves the learning problem on coarse meshes first and "hot-starts" the next finer level, cutting the required fine mesh iterations by an additional order of magnitude. Extensive experiments on image denoising, deblurring, inpainting and super-resolution tasks using UNet, ResNet and ESPCN backbones confirm the practical benefits: Full-Multiscale reduces the computation costs by 4-16$\times$ with no significant loss in performance. Together, MGE and Full-Multiscale offer a principled, architecture-agnostic route to accelerate CNN training on high-resolution data without sacrificing accuracy, and they can be combined with other variance-reduction or learning-rate schedules to further enhance scalability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in natural language processing tasks, yet their massive size makes serving them inefficient and costly. Semi-structured pruning has emerged as an effective method for model acceleration, but existing approaches are suboptimal because they focus on local, layer-wise optimizations using heuristic rules, failing to leverage global feedback. We present ProxSparse, a learning-based framework for mask selection enabled by regularized optimization. ProxSparse transforms the rigid, non-differentiable mask selection process into a smoother optimization procedure, allowing gradual mask exploration with flexibility. ProxSparse does not involve additional weight updates once the mask is determined. Our extensive evaluations on 7 widely used models show that ProxSparse consistently outperforms previously proposed semi-structured mask selection methods with significant improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our learned approach towards semi-structured pruning.

Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done ad hoc by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We employ this approach to a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and identify a useful perturbation and frequency among several possibilities. We demonstrate the transferability of the approach to other datasets, architectures, optimizers and even tasks (regression instead of classification). Our work allows optimization of perturbations for improving the training of machine learning models using a first-passage approach.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning allows participants to remove their data from a trained machine learning model in order to preserve their privacy, and security. However, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather limited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model) considers minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I model for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the machine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained model will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not generate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we consider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer recognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To achieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with gradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with theoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\epsilon, \delta)$-unlearning guarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is further fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We also propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively removed the influence of forget samples. Extensive empirical evaluation on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places365 highlights the superiority of our approach. To show comparable performance with retrained model, we also show the comparison of a simple AutoEncoder on various baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, we typically refer to unsupervised pre-training when we aim to pre-train a policy without a priori access to the task specification, i.e. rewards, to be later employed for efficient learning of downstream tasks. In single-agent settings, the problem has been extensively studied and mostly understood. A popular approach, called task-agnostic exploration, casts the unsupervised objective as maximizing the entropy of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy, from which principles and methods follow.
  In contrast, little is known about it in multi-agent settings, which are ubiquitous in the real world. What are the pros and cons of alternative problem formulations in this setting? How hard is the problem in theory, how can we solve it in practice? In this paper, we address these questions by first characterizing those alternative formulations and highlighting how the problem, even when tractable in theory, is non-trivial in practice. Then, we present a scalable, decentralized, trust-region policy search algorithm to address the problem in practical settings. Finally, we provide numerical validations to both corroborate the theoretical findings and pave the way for unsupervised multi-agent reinforcement learning via task-agnostic exploration in challenging domains, showing that optimizing for a specific objective, namely mixture entropy, provides an excellent trade-off between tractability and performances.

Abstract: A tenet of reinforcement learning is that the agent always observes rewards. However, this is not true in many realistic settings, e.g., a human observer may not always be available to provide rewards, sensors may be limited or malfunctioning, or rewards may be inaccessible during deployment. Monitored Markov decision processes (Mon-MDPs) have recently been proposed to model such settings. However, existing Mon-MDP algorithms have several limitations: they do not fully exploit the problem structure, cannot leverage a known monitor, lack worst-case guarantees for 'unsolvable' Mon-MDPs without specific initialization, and offer only asymptotic convergence proofs. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce a model-based algorithm for Mon-MDPs that addresses these shortcomings. The algorithm employs two instances of model-based interval estimation: one to ensure that observable rewards are reliably captured, and another to learn the minimax-optimal policy. Second, we empirically demonstrate the advantages. We show faster convergence than prior algorithms in over four dozen benchmarks, and even more dramatic improvement when the monitoring process is known. Third, we present the first finite-sample bound on performance. We show convergence to a minimax-optimal policy even when some rewards are never observable.

Abstract: Approximate second-order optimization methods often exhibit poorer generalization compared to first-order approaches. In this work, we look into this issue through the lens of the loss landscape and find that existing second-order methods tend to converge to sharper minima compared to SGD. In response, we propose Sassha, a novel second-order method designed to enhance generalization by explicitly reducing sharpness of the solution, while stabilizing the computation of approximate Hessians along the optimization trajectory. In fact, this sharpness minimization scheme is crafted also to accommodate lazy Hessian updates, so as to secure efficiency besides flatness. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct a wide range of standard deep learning experiments where Sassha demonstrates its outstanding generalization performance that is comparable to, and mostly better than, other methods. We provide a comprehensive set of analyses including convergence, robustness, stability, efficiency, and cost.

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network and the selection of its activation function are both fundamental to its performance. Equally vital is ensuring these two elements are well-matched, as their alignment is key to achieving effective representation and learning. In this paper, we introduce the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN), a novel model that creates a strong synergy between them. We demonstrate that FMMNNs are highly effective and flexible in modeling high-frequency components. Our theoretical results demonstrate that FMMNNs have exponential expressive power for function approximation. We also analyze the optimization landscape of FMMNNs and find it to be much more favorable than that of standard fully connected neural networks, especially when dealing with high-frequency features. In addition, we propose a scaled random initialization method for the first layer's weights in FMMNNs, which significantly speeds up training and enhances overall performance. Extensive numerical experiments support our theoretical insights, showing that FMMNNs consistently outperform traditional approaches in accuracy and efficiency across various tasks.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants, such as ADAM, are foundational to deep learning optimization, adjusting model parameters through fixed or adaptive learning rates based on loss function gradients. However, these methods often struggle to balance adaptability and efficiency in high-dimensional, non-convex settings. This paper introduces AYLA, a novel optimization framework that enhances training dynamics via loss function transformation. AYLA applies a tunable power-law transformation to the loss, preserving critical points while scaling loss values to amplify gradient sensitivity and accelerate convergence. Additionally, we propose an effective learning rate that dynamically adapts to the transformed loss, further improving optimization efficiency. Empirical evaluations on minimizing a synthetic non-convex polynomial, solving a non-convex curve-fitting task, and performing digit classification (MNIST) and image recognition (CIFAR-100) demonstrate that AYLA consistently outperforms SGD and ADAM in both convergence speed and training stability. By reshaping the loss landscape, AYLA provides a model-agnostic enhancement to existing optimization methods, offering a promising advancement in deep neural network training.

Abstract: Modeling stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is crucial for understanding complex dynamical systems in various scientific fields. Recent methods often employ neural network-based models, which typically represent SDEs through a combination of deterministic and stochastic terms. However, these models usually lack interpretability and have difficulty generalizing beyond their training domain. This paper introduces the Finite Expression Method (FEX), a symbolic learning approach designed to derive interpretable mathematical representations of the deterministic component of SDEs. For the stochastic component, we integrate FEX with advanced generative modeling techniques to provide a comprehensive representation of SDEs. The numerical experiments on linear, nonlinear, and multidimensional SDEs demonstrate that FEX generalizes well beyond the training domain and delivers more accurate long-term predictions compared to neural network-based methods. The symbolic expressions identified by FEX not only improve prediction accuracy but also offer valuable scientific insights into the underlying dynamics of the systems, paving the way for new scientific discoveries.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis prevents train disruptions by ensuring the stability and reliability of their transmission systems. Data-driven fault diagnosis models have several advantages over traditional methods in terms of dealing with non-linearity, adaptability, scalability, and automation. However, existing data-driven models are trained on separate transmission components and only consider single faults due to the limitations of existing datasets. These models will perform worse in scenarios where components operate with each other at the same time, affecting each component's vibration signals. To address some of these challenges, we propose a frequency domain representation and a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network for compound fault diagnosis and applied it on the PHM Beijing 2024 dataset, which includes 21 sensor channels, 17 single faults, and 42 compound faults from 4 interacting components, that is, motor, gearbox, left axle box, and right axle box. Our proposed model achieved 97.67% and 93.93% accuracies on the test set with 17 single faults and on the test set with 42 compound faults, respectively.

Abstract: Advances in self-distillation have shown that when knowledge is distilled from a teacher to a student using the same deep learning (DL) architecture, the student performance can surpass the teacher particularly when the network is overparameterized and the teacher is trained with early stopping. Alternatively, ensemble learning also improves performance, although training, storing, and deploying multiple models becomes impractical as the number of models grows. Even distilling an ensemble to a single student model or weight averaging methods first requires training of multiple teacher models and does not fully leverage the inherent stochasticity for generating and distilling diversity in DL models. These constraints are particularly prohibitive in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive applications such as wearable devices. This paper proposes to train only one model and generate multiple diverse teacher representations using distillation-time dropout. However, generating these representations stochastically leads to noisy representations that are misaligned with the learned task. To overcome this problem, a novel stochastic self-distillation (SSD) training strategy is introduced for filtering and weighting teacher representation to distill from task-relevant representations only, using student-guided knowledge distillation (SGKD). The student representation at each distillation step is used as authority to guide the distillation process. Experimental results on real-world affective computing, wearable/biosignal datasets from the UCR Archive, the HAR dataset, and image classification datasets show that the proposed SSD method can outperform state-of-the-art methods without increasing the model size at both training and testing time, and incurs negligible computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art ensemble learning and weight averaging methods.

Abstract: Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models will be released at https://github.com/mukhal/thinkprm.

Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to learn critical safety and correctness properties purely from data, highlighting the need for training methods that directly integrate logical specifications. While adversarial training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within $\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Differentiable logics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss terms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In this paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be unified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning, as a step toward effective formal verification of neural networks. We show that well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general approach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study involving a neural network controller for a drone system. Our framework is made publicly available at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

Abstract: Parallel data collection has redefined Reinforcement Learning (RL), unlocking unprecedented efficiency and powering breakthroughs in large-scale real-world applications. In this paradigm, $N$ identical agents operate in $N$ replicas of an environment simulator, accelerating data collection by a factor of $N$. A critical question arises: \textit{Does specializing the policies of the parallel agents hold the key to surpass the $N$ factor acceleration?} In this paper, we introduce a novel learning framework that maximizes the entropy of collected data in a parallel setting. Our approach carefully balances the entropy of individual agents with inter-agent diversity, effectively minimizing redundancies. The latter idea is implemented with a centralized policy gradient method, which shows promise when evaluated empirically against systems of identical agents, as well as synergy with batch RL techniques that can exploit data diversity. Finally, we provide an original concentration analysis that shows faster rates for specialized parallel sampling distributions, which supports our methodology and may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables the utilization of vast, previously inaccessible data sources. At the same time, pre-trained Language Models (LMs) have taken the world by storm and for good reason. They exhibit remarkable emergent abilities and are readily adapted to downstream tasks. This opens one of the most exciting frontiers in FL: fine-tuning LMs. Yet, a persistent challenge in FL is the frequent, rigid communication of parameters -- a problem magnified by the sheer size of these contemporary models. The FedOpt family of algorithms has become the go-to approach for FL, relying on fixed but arbitrary intervals for model exchanges. Recently, the FDA algorithm prescribed a dynamic approach by monitoring the training progress. However, it introduced a hard-to-calibrate parameter and imposed a rigid synchronization scheme. In this work, we address these limitations by proposing the FDA-Opt family of algorithms -- a unified generalization of both FDA and FedOpt. Our experimental evaluation focuses on fine-tuning LMs on downstream NLP tasks and demonstrates that FDA-Opt outperforms FedOpt even when it is configured with hyper-parameters specifically optimized for the latter. In other words, we show that FDA-Opt is a practical, drop-in replacement for FedOpt in modern FL libraries and systems: it requires no additional configuration and delivers superior performance out of the box.

<title>Critical Batch Size Revisited: A Simple Empirical Approach to Large-Batch Language Model Training</title>

Abstract: The right batch size is important when training language models at scale: a large batch size is necessary for fast training, but a batch size that is too large will harm token efficiency. To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al. (2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not substantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale during training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when training GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a proxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be trusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a simple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS evolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that CBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus as training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across different model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can inform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over training motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language models at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the CBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to slightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient steps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language models at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising performance.

Abstract: Recent neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising problem-solving ability without requiring domain-specific expertise. Most existing NCO methods use training and testing data with a fixed constraint value and lack research on the effect of constraint tightness on the performance of NCO methods. This paper takes the capacity-constrained vehicle routing problem (CVRP) as an example to empirically analyze the NCO performance under different tightness degrees of the capacity constraint. Our analysis reveals that existing NCO methods overfit the capacity constraint, and they can only perform satisfactorily on a small range of the constraint values but poorly on other values. To tackle this drawback of existing NCO methods, we develop an efficient training scheme that explicitly considers varying degrees of constraint tightness and proposes a multi-expert module to learn a generally adaptable solving strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively overcome the overfitting issue, demonstrating superior performances on the CVRP and CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW) with various constraint tightness degrees.

Abstract: Traditional instrumental variable (IV) estimators face a fundamental constraint: they can only accommodate as many endogenous treatment variables as available instruments. This limitation becomes particularly challenging in settings where the treatment is presented in a high-dimensional and unstructured manner (e.g. descriptions of patient treatment pathways in a hospital). In such settings, researchers typically resort to applying unsupervised dimension reduction techniques to learn a low-dimensional treatment representation prior to implementing IV regression analysis. We show that such methods can suffer from substantial omitted variable bias due to implicit regularization in the representation learning step. We propose a novel approach to construct treatment representations by explicitly incorporating instrumental variables during the representation learning process. Our approach provides a framework for handling high-dimensional endogenous variables with limited instruments. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that fitting IV models on these instrument-informed representations ensures identification of directions that optimize outcome prediction. Our experiments show that our proposed methodology improves upon the conventional two-stage approaches that perform dimension reduction without incorporating instrument information.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMMTSF_NeurIPS2025.

Abstract: The study of nonconvex minimax games has gained significant momentum in machine learning and decision science communities due to their fundamental connections to adversarial training scenarios. This work develops a primal-dual alternating proximal gradient (PDAPG) algorithm framework for resolving iterative minimax games featuring nonsmooth nonconvex objectives subject to coupled linear constraints. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees for both nonconvex-strongly concave and nonconvex-concave game configurations, demonstrating that PDAPG achieves an $\varepsilon$-stationary solution within $\mathcal{O}\left( \varepsilon ^{-2} \right)$ iterations for strongly concave settings and $\mathcal{O}\left( \varepsilon ^{-4} \right)$ iterations for concave scenarios. Our analysis provides the first known iteration complexity bounds for this class of constrained minimax games, particularly addressing the critical challenge of coupled linear constraints that induce inherent interdependencies among strategy variables. The proposed game-theoretic framework advances existing solution methodologies by simultaneously handling nonsmooth components and coordinated constraint structures through alternating primal-dual updates.

<title>Deep neural networks with ReLU, leaky ReLU, and softplus activation provably overcome the curse of dimensionality for Kolmogorov partial differential equations with Lipschitz nonlinearities in the $L^p$-sense</title>

arXiv:2309.13722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several deep learning (DL) methods for approximating high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) have been proposed. The interest that these methods have generated in the literature is in large part due to simulations which appear to demonstrate that such DL methods have the capacity to overcome the curse of dimensionality (COD) for PDEs in the sense that the number of computational operations they require to achieve a certain approximation accuracy $\varepsilon\in(0,\infty)$ grows at most polynomially in the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb N$ and the reciprocal of $\varepsilon$. While there is thus far no mathematical result that proves that one of such methods is indeed capable of overcoming the COD, there are now a number of rigorous results in the literature that show that deep neural networks (DNNs) have the expressive power to approximate PDE solutions without the COD in the sense that the number of parameters used to describe the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb N$ and the reciprocal of the approximation accuracy $\varepsilon>0$. Roughly speaking, in the literature it is has been proved for every $T>0$ that solutions $u_d\colon [0,T]\times\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$, $d\in\mathbb N$, of semilinear heat PDEs with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated by DNNs with ReLU activation at the terminal time in the $L^2$-sense without the COD provided that the initial value functions $\mathbb R^d\ni x\mapsto u_d(0,x)\in\mathbb R$, $d\in\mathbb N$, can be approximated by ReLU DNNs without the COD. It is the key contribution of this work to generalize this result by establishing this statement in the $L^p$-sense with $p\in(0,\infty)$ and by allowing the activation function to be more general covering the ReLU, the leaky ReLU, and the softplus activation functions as special cases.

Abstract: A realistic human kinematic model that satisfies anatomical constraints is essential for human-robot interaction, biomechanics and robot-assisted rehabilitation. Modeling realistic joint constraints, however, is challenging as human arm motion is constrained by joint limits, inter- and intra-joint dependencies, self-collisions, individual capabilities and muscular or neurological constraints which are difficult to represent. Hence, physicians and researchers have relied on simple box-constraints, ignoring important anatomical factors. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to learn realistic anatomically constrained upper-limb range of motion (RoM) boundaries from motion capture data. This is achieved by fitting a one-class support vector machine to a dataset of upper-limb joint space exploration motions with an efficient hyper-parameter tuning scheme. Our approach outperforms similar works focused on valid RoM learning. Further, we propose an impairment index (II) metric that offers a quantitative assessment of capability/impairment when comparing healthy and impaired arms. We validate the metric on healthy subjects physically constrained to emulate hemiplegia and different disability levels as stroke patients. [https://sites.google.com/seas.upenn.edu/learning-rom]

Abstract: Object detectors often perform poorly on data that differs from their training set. Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) methods have recently demonstrated strong results on addressing this challenge. Unfortunately, we identify systemic benchmarking pitfalls that call past results into question and hamper further progress: (a) Overestimation of performance due to underpowered baselines, (b) Inconsistent implementation practices preventing transparent comparisons of methods, and (c) Lack of generality due to outdated backbones and lack of diversity in benchmarks. We address these problems by introducing: (1) A unified benchmarking and implementation framework, Align and Distill (ALDI), enabling comparison of DAOD methods and supporting future development, (2) A fair and modern training and evaluation protocol for DAOD that addresses benchmarking pitfalls, (3) A new DAOD benchmark dataset, CFC-DAOD, enabling evaluation on diverse real-world data, and (4) A new method, ALDI++, that achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin. ALDI++ outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by +3.5 AP50 on Cityscapes to Foggy Cityscapes, +5.7 AP50 on Sim10k to Cityscapes (where ours is the only method to outperform a fair baseline), and +0.6 AP50 on CFC Kenai to Channel. ALDI and ALDI++ are architecture-agnostic, setting a new state-of-the-art for YOLO and DETR-based DAOD as well without additional hyperparameter tuning. Our framework, dataset, and state-of-the-art method offer a critical reset for DAOD and provide a strong foundation for future research.

arXiv:2403.16776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anatomical atlases are widely used for population studies and analysis. Conditional atlases target a specific sub-population defined via certain conditions, such as demographics or pathologies, and allow for the investigation of fine-grained anatomical differences like morphological changes associated with ageing or disease. Existing approaches use either registration-based methods that are often unable to handle large anatomical variations or generative adversarial models, which are challenging to train since they can suffer from training instabilities. Instead of generating atlases directly in as intensities, we propose using latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, which transform a general population atlas into one representing a specific sub-population. Our approach ensures structural integrity, enhances interpretability and avoids hallucinations that may arise during direct image synthesis by generating this deformation field and regularising it using a neighbourhood of images. We compare our method to several state-of-the-art atlas generation methods using brain MR images from the UK Biobank. Our method generates highly realistic atlases with smooth transformations and high anatomical fidelity, outperforming existing baselines. We demonstrate the quality of these atlases through comprehensive evaluations, including quantitative metrics for anatomical accuracy, perceptual similarity, and qualitative analyses displaying the consistency and realism of the generated atlases.

<title>M3D: Manifold-based Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Distribution for Non-Deep Transfer Learning in Cross-subject and Cross-session EEG-based Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: Emotion decoding using Electroencephalography (EEG)-based affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) plays a crucial role in affective computing but is limited by challenges such as EEG's non-stationarity, individual variability, and the high cost of large labeled datasets. While deep learning methods are effective, they require extensive computational resources and large data volumes, limiting their practical application. To overcome these issues, we propose Manifold-based Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Distribution (M3D), a lightweight, non-deep transfer learning framework. M3D consists of four key modules: manifold feature transformation, dynamic distribution alignment, classifier learning, and ensemble learning. The data is mapped to an optimal Grassmann manifold space, enabling dynamic alignment of source and target domains. This alignment is designed to prioritize both marginal and conditional distributions, improving adaptation efficiency across diverse datasets. In classifier learning, the principle of structural risk minimization is applied to build robust classification models. Additionally, dynamic distribution alignment iteratively refines the classifier. The ensemble learning module aggregates classifiers from different optimization stages to leverage diversity and enhance prediction accuracy. M3D is evaluated on two EEG emotion recognition datasets using two validation protocols (cross-subject single-session and cross-subject cross-session) and a clinical EEG dataset for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Experimental results show that M3D outperforms traditional non-deep learning methods with a 4.47% average improvement and achieves deep learning-level performance with reduced data and computational requirements, demonstrating its potential for real-world aBCI applications.

Abstract: Minimizing the need for pixel-level annotated data to train PET lesion detection and segmentation networks is highly desired and can be transformative, given time and cost constraints associated with expert annotations. Current unsupervised or weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained only on healthy data. While these approaches reduce annotation dependency, GAN-based methods are notably more challenging to train than non-GAN alternatives (such as autoencoders) due to issues such as the simultaneous optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, and training instability. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised $\textbf{I}$mplicitly-$\textbf{g}$uided $\textbf{CO}$u$\textbf{N}$terfactual diffusion model for $\textbf{D}$etecting $\textbf{A}$nomalies in $\textbf{PET}$ images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases (multi-cancer, multi-tracer) containing both local and public datasets (spanning multiple centers). The training is conditioned on image class labels (healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates "unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUV$_\text{max}$ thresholding. We also highlight the importance of incorporating attention modules in our network for the detection of small anomalies. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ahxmeds/IgCONDA-PET.git.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women and causes high death rates. Earlier models for detecting cervical cancer had limited success. In this work, we propose new models that substantially outperform previous models.
  Previous studies show that pretrained ResNets extract features from cervical cancer images well. Hence, our first model involves working with three ResNets (50, 101, 152). All the existing works use only the last convolution block of their respective ResNet, which captures abstract features (e.g., shapes, objects). However, we believe that detailed features (e.g., color, edges, texture), coming from earlier convolution blocks, are equally important for cancer (specifically cervical cancer) classification. Since now the number of features become large, we use a novel feature selection technique of Global Max Pooling for detailed features and Global Average Pooling for abstract features. Hence, our second model consists of the resulting Cascaded Block Fused variants of the three ResNets. To improve the performance further, we combine and normalize the features of the three standard ResNets as well as our proposed three Cascaded Block Fused ResNets. This type of combination is also new in cancer classification domain (also in cervical cancer), and results in our third and fourth models, respectively. We use a linear SVM for classification.
  We exhaustively perform experiments on two public datasets, IARC and AnnoCerv, achieving an average performance of 97.92% and 92.97% surpassing standard ResNets performance of 90.89% and 87.97%, respectively. We outperform the competitive approach available on IARC dataset with an average gain of 13.20%, while no prior competitive work available on AnnoCerv. Additionally, we introduce a novel SHAP+LIME explainability method, accurately identifying the cancerous region in 97% of cases.

arXiv:2405.09567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: In this paper we develop and evaluate ECG-SMART-NET for occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI) identification. OMI is a severe form of heart attack characterized by complete blockage of one or more coronary arteries requiring immediate referral for cardiac catheterization to restore blood flow to the heart. Two thirds of OMI cases are difficult to visually identify from a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and can be potentially fatal if not identified quickly. Previous works on this topic are scarce, and current state-of-the-art evidence suggests both feature-based random forests and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are promising approaches to improve ECG detection of OMI. Methods: While the ResNet architecture has been adapted for use with ECG recordings, it is not ideally suited to capture informative temporal features within each lead and the spatial concordance or discordance across leads. We propose a clinically informed modification of the ResNet-18 architecture. The model first learns temporal features through temporal convolutional layers with 1xk kernels followed by a spatial convolutional layer, after the residual blocks, with 12x1 kernels to learn spatial features. Results: ECG-SMART-NET was benchmarked against the original ResNet-18 and other state-of-the-art models on a multisite real-word clinical dataset that consists of 10,393 ECGs from 7,397 unique patients (rate of OMI =7.2%). ECG-SMART-NET outperformed other models in the classification of OMI with a test AUC of 0.953 [0.921, 0.978]. Conclusion and Significance: ECG-SMART-NET can outperform the state-of-the-art random forest for OMI prediction and is better suited for this task than the original ResNet-18 architecture.

Abstract: We present a fully constructive analysis of deep ReLU neural networks for classification and function approximation tasks. First, we prove that any dataset with $N$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $M$ output classes can be exactly classified using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) of width $2$ and depth at most $2N + 4M - 1$, with all network parameters constructed explicitly. This result is sharp with respect to width and is interpreted through the lens of simultaneous or ensemble controllability in discrete nonlinear dynamics.
  Second, we show that these explicit constructions yield uniform bounds on the parameter norms and, in particular, provide upper estimates for minimizers of standard regularized training loss functionals in supervised learning. As the regularization parameter vanishes, the trained networks converge to exact classifiers with bounded norm, explaining the effectiveness of overparameterized training in the small-regularization regime.
  We also prove a universal approximation theorem in $L^p(\Omega; \mathbb{R}_+)$ for any bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and $p \in [1, \infty)$, using MLPs of fixed width $d + 1$. The proof is constructive, geometrically motivated, and provides explicit estimates on the network depth when the target function belongs to the Sobolev space $W^{1,p}$. We also extend the approximation and depth estimation results to $L^p(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^m)$ for any $m \geq 1$.
  Our results offer a unified and interpretable framework connecting controllability, expressivity, and training dynamics in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Being prompted to engage in reasoning has emerged as a core technique for using large language models (LLMs), deploying additional inference-time compute to improve task performance. However, as LLMs increase in both size and adoption, inference costs are correspondingly becoming increasingly burdensome. How, then, might we optimize reasoning's cost-performance tradeoff? This work introduces a novel approach based on computational models of metareasoning used in cognitive science, training LLMs to selectively use intermediate reasoning steps only when necessary. We first develop a reward function that incorporates the Value of Computation by penalizing unnecessary reasoning, then use this reward function with Expert Iteration to train the LLM. Compared to few-shot chain-of-thought prompting and STaR, our method significantly reduces inference costs (20-37\% fewer tokens generated across three models) while maintaining task performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to automated jailbreak attacks, where adversarial suffixes crafted by algorithms appended to harmful queries bypass safety alignment and trigger unintended responses. Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly 100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99\% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49\% ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3. Beyond improving jailbreak ability, ADV-LLM provides valuable insights for future safety alignment research through its ability to generate large datasets for studying LLM safety.

<title>Do Vendi Scores Converge with Finite Samples? Truncated Vendi Score for Finite-Sample Convergence Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Evaluating the diversity of generative models without reference data poses methodological challenges. The reference-free Vendi and RKE scores address this by quantifying the diversity of generated data using matrix-based entropy measures. Among these two, the Vendi score is typically computed via the eigendecomposition of an $n \times n$ kernel matrix constructed from n generated samples. However, the prohibitive computational cost of eigendecomposition for large $n$ often limits the number of samples used to fewer than 20,000. In this paper, we investigate the statistical convergence of the Vendi and RKE scores under restricted sample sizes. We numerically demonstrate that, in general, the Vendi score computed with standard sample sizes below 20,000 may not converge to its asymptotic value under infinite sampling. To address this, we introduce the $t$-truncated Vendi score by truncating the eigenspectrum of the kernel matrix, which is provably guaranteed to converge to its population limit with $n=\mathcal{O}(t)$ samples. We further show that existing Nystr\"om and FKEA approximation methods converge to the asymptotic limit of the truncated Vendi score. In contrast to the Vendi score, we prove that the RKE score enjoys universal convergence guarantees across all kernel functions. We conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the concentration of Nystr\"om and FKEA computed Vendi scores around the truncated Vendi score, and we analyze how the truncated Vendi and RKE scores correlate with the diversity of image and text data. The code is available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/truncated-vendi.

Abstract: Current causal discovery approaches require restrictive model assumptions in the absence of interventional data to ensure structure identifiability. These assumptions often do not hold in real-world applications leading to a loss of guarantees and poor performance in practice. Recent work has shown that, in the bivariate case, Bayesian model selection can greatly improve performance by exchanging restrictive modelling for more flexible assumptions, at the cost of a small probability of making an error. Our work shows that this approach is useful in the important multivariate case as well. We propose a scalable algorithm leveraging a continuous relaxation of the discrete model selection problem. Specifically, we employ the Causal Gaussian Process Conditional Density Estimator (CGP-CDE) as a Bayesian non-parametric model, using its hyperparameters to construct an adjacency matrix. This matrix is then optimised using the marginal likelihood and an acyclicity regulariser, giving the maximum a posteriori causal graph. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach, showing it is advantageous to perform multivariate causal discovery without infeasible assumptions using Bayesian model selection.

Abstract: Unequal access to costly datasets essential for empirical research has long hindered researchers from disadvantaged institutions, limiting their ability to contribute to their fields and advance their careers. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.

Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations -- made tractable by the RBM's structure -- we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.

<title>Towards Robust Stability Prediction in Smart Grids: GAN-based Approach under Data Constraints and Adversarial Challenges</title>

Abstract: Smart grids are crucial for meeting rising energy demands driven by global population growth and urbanization. By integrating renewable energy sources, they enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. However, ensuring their availability and security requires advanced operational control and safety measures. Although artificial intelligence and machine learning can help assess grid stability, challenges such as data scarcity and cybersecurity threats, particularly adversarial attacks, remain. Data scarcity is a major issue, as obtaining real-world instances of grid instability requires significant expertise, resources, and time. Yet, these instances are critical for testing new research advancements and security mitigations. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting instability in smart grids using only stable data. It employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where the generator is designed not to produce near-realistic data but instead to generate Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples with respect to the stable class. These OOD samples represent unstable behavior, anomalies, or disturbances that deviate from the stable data distribution. By training exclusively on stable data and exposing the discriminator to OOD samples, our framework learns a robust decision boundary to distinguish stable conditions from any unstable behavior, without requiring unstable data during training. Furthermore, we incorporate an adversarial training layer to enhance resilience against attacks. Evaluated on a real-world dataset, our solution achieves up to 98.1\% accuracy in predicting grid stability and 98.9\% in detecting adversarial attacks. Implemented on a single-board computer, it enables real-time decision-making with an average response time of under 7ms.

Abstract: This paper provides an elementary, self-contained analysis of diffusion-based sampling methods for generative modeling. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on continuous-time processes and then discretize, our treatment works directly with discrete-time stochastic processes and yields precise non-asymptotic convergence guarantees under broad assumptions. The key insight is to couple the sampling process of interest with an idealized comparison process that has an explicit Gaussian-convolution structure. We then leverage simple identities from information theory, including the I-MMSE relationship, to bound the discrepancy (in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence) between these two discrete-time processes. In particular, we show that, if the diffusion step sizes are chosen sufficiently small and one can approximate certain conditional mean estimators well, then the sampling distribution is provably close to the target distribution. Our results also provide a transparent view on how to accelerate convergence by using additional randomness in each step to match higher-order moments in the comparison process.

<title>Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models</title>

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive generation has emerged as a new powerful paradigm with image autoregressive models (IARs) matching state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) in image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) while allowing for a higher generation speed. However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns regarding their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to the ones of DMs as reference points. Concretely, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images (with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% of 86.38% vs. 6.38% for DMs with comparable attacks). We leverage our novel MIA to provide dataset inference (DI) for IARs, and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership (compared to 200 for DI in DMs), confirming a higher information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance. We release the code at https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars for reproducibility.

Abstract: Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Incorporating geometric invariance into neural networks enhances parameter efficiency but typically increases computational costs. This paper introduces new equivariant neural networks that preserve symmetry while maintaining a comparable number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) per parameter to standard non-equivariant networks. We focus on horizontal mirroring (flopping) invariance, common in many computer vision tasks. The main idea is to parametrize the feature spaces in terms of mirror-symmetric and mirror-antisymmetric features, i.e., irreps of the flopping group. This decomposes the linear layers to be block-diagonal, requiring half the number of FLOPs. Our approach reduces both FLOPs and wall-clock time, providing a practical solution for efficient, scalable symmetry-aware architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on prolonged reasoning chains to solve complex tasks. However, this trial-and-error approach often leads to high computational overhead and error propagation, where early mistakes can derail subsequent steps. To address these issues, we introduce Meta-Reasoner, a framework that dynamically optimizes inference-time reasoning by enabling LLMs to "think about how to think." Drawing inspiration from human meta-cognition and dual-process theory, Meta-Reasoner operates as a strategic advisor, decoupling high-level guidance from step-by-step generation. It employs contextual multi-armed bandits to iteratively evaluate reasoning progress and select optimal strategies (e.g., backtrack, clarify ambiguity, restart from scratch, or propose alternative approaches), and reallocates computational resources toward the most promising paths. Our evaluations on mathematical reasoning and puzzles highlight the potential of dynamic reasoning chains to overcome inherent challenges in the LLM reasoning process and also show promise in broader applications, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for reasoning-intensive tasks.

Abstract: The most promising recent methods for AI reasoning require applying variants of reinforcement learning (RL) either on rolled out trajectories from the LLMs, even for the step-wise rewards, or large quantities of human-annotated trajectory data. The reliance on the rolled-out trajectory renders the compute cost and time prohibitively high. In particular, the correctness of a reasoning trajectory can typically only be judged at its completion, leading to sparse rewards in RL or requiring expensive synthetic data generation in expert iteration-like methods. In this work, we focus on the Automatic Theorem Proving (ATP) task and propose a novel verifier-in-the-loop design, which, unlike existing approaches that leverage feedback on the entire reasoning trajectory, employs an automated verifier to give intermediate feedback at each step of the reasoning process. Using Lean as the verifier, we empirically show that the step-by-step local verification produces a global improvement in the model's reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.

Abstract: Time event cameras are a novel technology for recording scene information at extremely low latency and with low power consumption. Event cameras output a stream of events that encapsulate pixel-level light intensity changes within the scene, capturing information with a higher dynamic range and temporal resolution than traditional cameras. This study investigates the contact-free reconstruction of an individual's cardiac pulse signal from time event recording of their face using a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) model. An end-to-end model is trained to extract the cardiac signal from a two-dimensional representation of the event stream, with model performance evaluated based on the accuracy of the calculated heart rate. The experimental results confirm that physiological cardiac information in the facial region is effectively preserved within the event stream, showcasing the potential of this novel sensor for remote heart rate monitoring. The model trained on event frames achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.32 beats per minute (bpm) compared to the RMSE of 2.92 bpm achieved by the baseline model trained on standard camera frames. Furthermore, models trained on event frames generated at 60 and 120 FPS outperformed the 30 FPS standard camera results, achieving an RMSE of 2.54 and 2.13 bpm, respectively.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has led to considerable progress in Speaker Verification (SV). The standard framework uses same-utterance positive sampling and data-augmentation to generate anchor-positive pairs of the same speaker. This is a major limitation, as this strategy primarily encodes channel information from the recording condition, shared by the anchor and positive. We propose a new positive sampling technique to address this bottleneck: Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS). For a given anchor, SSPS aims to find an appropriate positive, i.e., of the same speaker identity but a different recording condition, in the latent space using clustering assignments and a memory queue of positive embeddings. SSPS improves SV performance for both SimCLR and DINO, reaching 2.57% and 2.53% EER, outperforming SOTA SSL methods on VoxCeleb1-O. In particular, SimCLR-SSPS achieves a 58% EER reduction by lowering intra-speaker variance, providing comparable performance to DINO-SSPS.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under (approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their representations. We find that small and large models learn similar representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. In particular, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to 50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability, finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

Abstract: Business Process Simulation (BPS) refers to techniques designed to replicate the dynamic behavior of a business process. Many approaches have been proposed to automatically discover simulation models from historical event logs, reducing the cost and time to manually design them. However, in dynamic business environments, organizations continuously refine their processes to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Existing techniques to process simulation discovery lack adaptability to real-time operational changes. In this paper, we propose a streaming process simulation discovery technique that integrates Incremental Process Discovery with Online Machine Learning methods. This technique prioritizes recent data while preserving historical information, ensuring adaptation to evolving process dynamics. Experiments conducted on four different event logs demonstrate the importance in simulation of giving more weight to recent data while retaining historical knowledge. Our technique not only produces more stable simulations but also exhibits robustness in handling concept drift, as highlighted in one of the use cases.

<title>The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to minimizing tail latency in queues.

Abstract: We present Sleeping-DISCO 9M, a large-scale pre-training dataset for music and song. To the best of our knowledge, there are no open-source high-quality dataset representing popular and well-known songs for generative music modeling tasks such as text-music, music-captioning, singing-voice synthesis, melody reconstruction and cross-model retrieval. Past contributions focused on isolated and constrained factors whose core perspective was to create synthetic or re-recorded music corpus (e.g. GTSinger, M4Singer) and arbitrarily large-scale audio datasets (e.g. DISCO-10M and LAIONDISCO-12M) had been another focus for the community. Unfortunately, adoption of these datasets has been below substantial in the generative music community as these datasets fail to reflect real-world music and its flavour. Our dataset changes this narrative and provides a dataset that is constructed using actual popular music and world-renowned artists.

Abstract: This document is an evaluation of the original "Rank-N-Contrast" (arXiv:2210.01189v2) paper published in 2023. This evaluation is done for academic purposes. Deep regression models often fail to capture the continuous nature of sample orders, creating fragmented representations and suboptimal performance. To address this, we reproduced the Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) framework, which learns continuous representations by contrasting samples by their rankings in the target space. Our study validates RNC's theoretical and empirical benefits, including improved performance and robustness. We extended the evaluation to an additional regression dataset and conducted robustness tests using a holdout method, where a specific range of continuous data was excluded from the training set. This approach assessed the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This replication study validates the original findings and broadens the understanding of RNC's applicability and robustness.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, safety, secondary risks, risk primitives, SecLens

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in critical applications, leading to the need for ensuring their safety and alignment with societal functions. This study introduces the concept of secondary risks, which are non-adversarial failures arising from imperfect generalization during benign interactions. These risks manifest in harmful or misleading behaviors that evade standard safety mechanisms. The authors propose two risk primitives, verbose response, and speculative advice, to define these failure patterns and develop SecLens, a search framework to elicit secondary risk behaviors. Extensive evaluations on popular models demonstrate the prevalence of secondary risks, their transferability across models, and modality independence. The study emphasizes the urgency for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful behaviors of LLMs in real-world applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.

Summary:<br />
Machine unlearning (MU) is crucial for protecting data privacy and mitigating sociotechnical harms in large language models (LLMs). However, a new vulnerability called unlearning trace detection has been identified post-unlearning, where persistent "fingerprints" are left behind in LLMs. These traces can be detected through model behavior and internal representations, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant inputs. Traces are found in intermediate activations and propagate to the final layer, forming learnable manifolds in activation space. Forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in detecting unlearning traces, posing a risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information. The study highlights the need for enhanced security measures in LLMs to prevent the exploitation of unlearning vulnerabilities. <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models (LLMs), commonly referred to as LLM unlearning, seeks to remove specific undesirable data or knowledge from a trained model, while maintaining its performance on standard tasks. While unlearning plays a vital role in protecting data privacy, enforcing copyright, and mitigating sociotechnical harms in LLMs, we identify a new vulnerability post-unlearning: unlearning trace detection. We discover that unlearning leaves behind persistent ''fingerprints'' in LLMs, detectable traces in both model behavior and internal representations. These traces can be identified from output responses, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant inputs. Specifically, a simple supervised classifier can reliably determine whether a model has undergone unlearning based solely on its textual outputs. Further analysis shows that these traces are embedded in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer, forming low-dimensional, learnable manifolds in activation space. Through extensive experiments, we show that forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in detecting unlearning traces across all model sizes. Even with forget-irrelevant inputs, large LLMs maintain high detectability, demonstrating the broad applicability of unlearning trace detection. These findings reveal that unlearning leaves measurable signatures, introducing a new risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information when a model is identified as unlearned given an input query.

Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of current graph generation methods that model the evolution of nodes and edges independently with linear interpolations in Euclidean space. It proposes a new approach, BWFlow, that models the joint evolution of nodes and edges using Markov random fields (MRF) to better capture the non-Euclidean structure and interconnected patterns of graphs. By leveraging optimal transport displacement between MRF objects, BWFlow designs a probability path for graph generation that respects the underlying geometry of graphs and ensures smooth velocities. Experimental evaluations show that BWFlow outperforms existing methods in graph generation, achieving competitive performance, stable training, and guaranteed sampling convergence. <div>

Abstract: Graph generation has emerged as a critical task in fields ranging from molecule design to drug discovery. Contemporary approaches, notably diffusion and flow-based models, have achieved solid graph generative performance through constructing a probability path that interpolates between a reference distribution and the data distribution. However, these methods typically model the evolution of individual nodes and edges independently and use linear interpolations to build the path assuming that the data lie in Euclidean space. We show that this is suboptimal given the intrinsic non-Euclidean structure and interconnected patterns of graphs, and it poses risks to the sampling convergence. To build a better probability path, we model the joint evolution of the nodes and edges by representing graphs as connected systems parameterized by Markov random fields (MRF). We then leverage the optimal transport displacement between MRF objects to design the probability path for graph generation. Based on this, we introduce BWFlow, a flow-matching framework for graph generation that respects the underlying geometry of graphs and provides smooth velocities in the probability path. The novel framework can be adapted to both continuous and discrete flow-matching algorithms. Experimental evaluations in plain graph generation and 2D/3D molecule generation validate the effectiveness of BWFlow in graph generation with competitive performance, stable training, and guaranteed sampling convergence.

<div> Keywords: model MoE-ization, multi-task adaptation, conflict resistance, oblivion resistance, orthogonal experts

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach called model MoE-ization for multi-task adaptation of large-scale foundation models. This method aims to address issues such as task conflict and oblivion in adaptation scenarios. By applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to the weight matrix of a pre-trained model and introducing a learnable router, the method transforms the weight matrix into a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE). Each expert in MoORE corresponds to an outer product of left and right singular vectors, ensuring orthogonality among the experts. Unlike existing methods like LoRA, MoORE maintains the original weight matrix's column space and guarantees resistance to conflicts among new tasks and oblivion of original tasks. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MoORE in terms of conflict- and oblivion-resistance in multi-task adaptation scenarios. The code for the experiments is available on GitHub at https://github.com/DaShenZi721/MoORE.

Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation models in multi-task scenarios often suffers from task conflict and oblivion. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel ''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant multi-task adaptation method. Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our method applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its singular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix becomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert corresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the corresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a learnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts' orthogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix. These two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among the new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that MoORE outperforms existing multi-task adaptation methods consistently, showing its superiority in terms of conflict- and oblivion-resistance. The code of the experiments is available at https://github.com/DaShenZi721/MoORE.

<div> Keywords: Shortcut learning, Semantic distribution, Debiasing approach, Siamese network, Model generalization

Summary:
SCISSOR is a debiasing approach that aims to address shortcut learning in AI models by remapping the semantic space to discourage latent clusters that are exploited as shortcuts. By focusing on imbalances in the semantic distribution of sample embeddings, SCISSOR improves model robustness and generalization to out-of-distribution data. The approach does not require data augmentation or rewriting, making it a practical solution for enhancing model performance. SCISSOR outperforms baselines across various benchmarks, showing significant improvements in F1 scores for computer vision and NLP tasks. The evaluation on different models demonstrates the effectiveness of SCISSOR in mitigating shortcut learning and enhancing the bias resistance of AI systems. Overall, this study highlights the importance of addressing semantic biases in model training to foster more robust and generalizable AI systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shortcut learning undermines model generalization to out-of-distribution data. While the literature attributes shortcuts to biases in superficial features, we show that imbalances in the semantic distribution of sample embeddings induce spurious semantic correlations, compromising model robustness. To address this issue, we propose SCISSOR (Semantic Cluster Intervention for Suppressing ShORtcut), a Siamese network-based debiasing approach that remaps the semantic space by discouraging latent clusters exploited as shortcuts. Unlike prior data-debiasing approaches, SCISSOR eliminates the need for data augmentation and rewriting. We evaluate SCISSOR on 6 models across 4 benchmarks: Chest-XRay and Not-MNIST in computer vision, and GYAFC and Yelp in NLP tasks. Compared to several baselines, SCISSOR reports +5.3 absolute points in F1 score on GYAFC, +7.3 on Yelp, +7.7 on Chest-XRay, and +1 on Not-MNIST. SCISSOR is also highly advantageous for lightweight models with ~9.5% improvement on F1 for ViT on computer vision datasets and ~11.9% for BERT on NLP. Our study redefines the landscape of model generalization by addressing overlooked semantic biases, establishing SCISSOR as a foundational framework for mitigating shortcut learning and fostering more robust, bias-resistant AI systems.

<div> Keywords: deep neural networks, backdoor attacks, dataset purification, FLARE, robustness

Summary:
Dataset purification is a proactive defense strategy against backdoor attacks on deep neural networks. Existing purification methods assume that backdoor connections are simpler to learn than benign features, but this is not always the case in attacks such as all-to-all and untargeted attacks. FLARE is a universal purification method that aggregates abnormal activations from all hidden layers to cluster datasets effectively. By selecting an optimal subspace and assessing cluster stability, FLARE can identify and remove poisoned samples from datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate FLARE's effectiveness against 22 backdoor attacks, including A2O, A2A, and UT attacks, as well as its robustness to adaptive attacks. The code for FLARE is available on GitHub for further implementation and testing. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2411.19479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison datasets with adversary-specified triggers to implant hidden backdoors, enabling malicious manipulation of model predictions. Dataset purification serves as a proactive defense by removing malicious training samples to prevent backdoor injection at its source. We first reveal that the current advanced purification methods rely on a latent assumption that the backdoor connections between triggers and target labels in backdoor attacks are simpler to learn than the benign features. We demonstrate that this assumption, however, does not always hold, especially in all-to-all (A2A) and untargeted (UT) attacks. As a result, purification methods that analyze the separation between the poisoned and benign samples in the input-output space or the final hidden layer space are less effective. We observe that this separability is not confined to a single layer but varies across different hidden layers. Motivated by this understanding, we propose FLARE, a universal purification method to counter various backdoor attacks. FLARE aggregates abnormal activations from all hidden layers to construct representations for clustering. To enhance separation, FLARE develops an adaptive subspace selection algorithm to isolate the optimal space for dividing an entire dataset into two clusters. FLARE assesses the stability of each cluster and identifies the cluster with higher stability as poisoned. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE against 22 representative backdoor attacks, including all-to-one (A2O), all-to-all (A2A), and untargeted (UT) attacks, and its robustness to adaptive attacks.

Summary:
Through generative agent-based modeling, this study examined how the threat of infectious diseases affects social behavior. The experiments showed that generative agents who were exposed to news about disease outbreaks exhibited reduced social engagement, including lower attendance at social gatherings, fewer visits to public places, and decreased conversations. Agents attributed these changes to a desire to avoid infection and were able to differentiate between infectious and noninfectious diseases, adjusting their behavior accordingly. The findings demonstrate the potential of generative agent-based modeling as a tool for studying complex human social dynamics on a large scale. <div>

Abstract: How does the threat of infectious disease influence sociality among generative agents? We used generative agent-based modeling (GABM), powered by large language models, to experimentally test hypotheses about the behavioral immune system. Across three simulation runs, generative agents who read news about an infectious disease outbreak showed significantly reduced social engagement compared to agents who received no such news, including lower attendance at a social gathering, fewer visits to third places (e.g., cafe, store, park), and fewer conversations throughout the town. In interview responses, agents explicitly attributed their behavioral changes to disease-avoidance motivations. A validity check further indicated that they could distinguish between infectious and noninfectious diseases, selectively reducing social engagement only when there was a risk of infection. Our findings highlight the potential of GABM as an experimental tool for exploring complex human social dynamics at scale.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces AlphaDecay, a method for adapting weight decay strengths in large language models (LLMs) based on the spectral properties of each module. It leverages the Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization theory to analyze the empirical spectral density of weight correlation matrices and assign decay rates accordingly. Modules with heavier-tailed spectra, indicating stronger feature learning, receive weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra get stronger decay. This adaptive approach aims to balance the spectral differences across modules, leading to improved performance in pre-training tasks. Experimental results on LLMs of various sizes demonstrate that AlphaDecay outperforms uniform and other adaptive decay methods in terms of perplexity and generalization. The code for AlphaDecay is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.14562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weight decay is a standard regularization technique for training large language models (LLMs). While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify "heavy-tailedness." Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance. Extensive pre-training tasks with various model sizes from 60M to 1B demonstrate that AlphaDecay achieves better perplexity and generalization than conventional uniform decay and other adaptive decay baselines.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Skala, a deep learning-based exchange-correlation (XC) functional for Density Functional Theory (DFT) in electronic structure calculations. DFT is widely used but relies on approximations for the XC functional. Skala bypasses hand-crafted features by learning directly from data and achieves chemical accuracy for small molecule atomization energies, maintaining computational efficiency. It is trained on a large dataset of high-accuracy reference data, improving systematically with more diverse chemistry training data. Skala, with additional tailored high-accuracy data, competes with best hybrid functionals for general main group chemistry, at semi-local DFT cost. Continual dataset expansion can enhance predictive power for first-principles simulations. <div>

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion models, image generation, computational cost, text-to-image generation, routing mechanism 

Summary: 
Diffusion models are known for their high-fidelity image generation but come with high computational costs due to their sequential nature. This work proposes a framework to balance quality and computational cost by varying the amount of computation for each input prompt based on its complexity. The framework automatically routes prompts to the most suitable text-to-image generation function, which could involve different numbers of denoising steps or access to diverse text-to-image models. Unlike traditional cost reduction methods, this approach optimally allocates expensive computational choices for complex prompts and less expensive options for simpler prompts, resulting in improved image quality. Empirical results on COCO and DiffusionDB datasets demonstrate that by leveraging nine pre-trained text-to-image models, the proposed approach outperforms individual models in terms of average image quality. <div>
arXiv:2506.14753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are well known for their ability to generate a high-fidelity image for an input prompt through an iterative denoising process. Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts. We empirically demonstrate on COCO and DiffusionDB that by learning to route to nine already-trained text-to-image models, our approach is able to deliver an average quality that is higher than that achievable by any of these models alone.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs. This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer (MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE) layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains.

<div> Keywords: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, Vision Transformers, Progressive Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism, Attentional Guidance Loss, Foreground Fusion

Summary: 
Progressive Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM) is proposed to address the foreground object mismatch issue in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) using Vision Transformers (ViTs). PCaM filters out background information during cross-attention to focus on and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. An attentional guidance loss enhances cross-domain attention consistency by directing attention towards task-relevant regions. PCaM is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing ViT-based UDA pipelines. Experimental results on various datasets show that PCaM significantly improves adaptation performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in UDA. The effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain adaptation is validated through these experiments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation: foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet, VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results, validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain adaptation.

Summary:
Reasoning models, large language models that provide explicit reasoning for responses, have typically been focused on mathematics and logic. This study demonstrates that reasoning models can be post-trained for chemistry without specific domain pretraining. The ether0 model, a 24B parameter LLM trained on 640,730 chemistry problems using reinforcement learning, excels in natural language reasoning and producing chemical structures. It outperforms general-purpose and specialized chemistry models, as well as human experts, in tasks ranging from synthesizability to human receptor activity. Importantly, the model requires less data compared to specialized models, showcasing its data efficiency. This approach shows promise for training data-efficient language models specialized for scientific domains beyond chemistry. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific domains.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces MLBuf-RePlAce, an open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware analytical global placement framework designed to address timing closure challenges in modern technology nodes. By incorporating an efficient recursive learning-based generative buffering approach, MLBuf-RePlAce predicts buffer types and locations to improve total negative slack (TNS) without compromising post-route power. The framework effectively tackles Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations during global placement, outperforming traditional buffering approaches and machine learning-based methods like BufFormer. In open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts repositories, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves significant improvements in TNS, with maximum and average enhancements of 56% and 31% respectively. Additionally, when evaluated in a commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce demonstrates notable TNS improvements of 53% (maximum) and 28% (average) while maintaining a slight 0.2% enhancement in post-route power. <div>
arXiv:2506.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and (ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS) within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of (53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

Abstract: Interactions between modalities -- redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy -- collectively determine the composition of multimodal information. Understanding these interactions is crucial for analyzing information dynamics in multimodal systems, yet their accurate sample-level quantification presents significant theoretical and computational challenges. To address this, we introduce the Lightweight Sample-wise Multimodal Interaction (LSMI) estimator, rigorously grounded in pointwise information theory. We first develop a redundancy estimation framework, employing an appropriate pointwise information measure to quantify this most decomposable and measurable interaction. Building upon this, we propose a general interaction estimation method that employs efficient entropy estimation, specifically tailored for sample-wise estimation in continuous distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate LSMI's precision and efficiency. Crucially, our sample-wise approach reveals fine-grained sample- and category-level dynamics within multimodal data, enabling practical applications such as redundancy-informed sample partitioning, targeted knowledge distillation, and interaction-aware model ensembling.

<div> Keywords: early exiting, pre-trained language models, prediction certainty, NSP score, Certainty-Aware Probability

Summary: 
This research introduces a novel early exiting method for accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models. Existing methods for early exiting often overestimate prediction certainty by focusing only on class-relevant logits, leading to premature exiting of samples with incorrect predictions. To address this issue, the researchers propose a method based on the Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which considers both logits and a new NSP score that accounts for the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x across all tasks without significant performance degradation. The method outperforms the state-of-the-art ConsistentEE by 28%, striking a better balance between task performance and inference efficiency. The code for the method is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty, causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off between task performance and inference efficiency.

- The approach yields sparser adversarial examples, revealing two types of noises, "obscuring noise" and "leading noise," aiding in understanding how perturbations mislead classifiers.
- The code for the approach is available at https://github.com/fudong03/SparseAttack.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels (i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength. In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition, theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e., "obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

Summary:  
A novel framework called Referi is proposed to verify outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot examples. This framework evaluates candidate outputs by combining different scores inspired by Bayes' rule and selecting confidently determined and contextually coherent responses. Referi significantly improves LLM accuracy by an average gain of 4.8% across different tasks without additional training. This approach addresses the challenges of the stochastic reasoning process and varying conclusions of LLMs. By recycling few-shot examples for verification, Referi enhances response selection and eliminates the need for external verification models or majority voting methods. This framework provides an effective solution to evaluate and refine LLM outputs, contributing to the advancement of language model performance in natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot examples to verify LLM outputs (Referi). Our key idea is to additionally utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm, simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of fixed preference datasets.

Summary:
The article introduces StageRoute, an algorithm designed to efficiently manage the deployment and routing of large language models (LLMs) in a dynamic environment. It addresses the challenge faced by LLM service providers in balancing a constantly evolving inventory of models within set capacity and cost constraints. StageRoute optimistically selects models for deployment based on reward and cost considerations, then routes incoming queries using a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem. The algorithm is proven to achieve a regret of order T^{2/3}, demonstrating its near-optimality. Experimental results confirm the theoretical findings, showing that StageRoute performs close to the optimum in practical scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2506.17254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii) solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to the optimum in practical settings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights, importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity, alongside tolerable latency overhead.

Summary: <br />
- The study aimed to assess the predictive capability of optic nerve head (ONH) biomechanics in different patterns of glaucomatous visual field (VF) loss.
- A Geometric Deep Learning model incorporating biomechanical and structural features showed high accuracy in predicting VF loss patterns.
- The ONH strain significantly improved the prediction of VF loss patterns beyond morphology alone.
- The inferior and inferotemporal rim of the ONH were identified as key strain-sensitive regions contributing to the prediction of VF loss.
- The neuroretinal rim, rather than the lamina cribrosa, was found to be the most critical region in the model predictions. <div>

Abstract: Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these predictions.
  Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects: (1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124). Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains. Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each classification.
  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions, contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive expansion with increasing disease severity.
  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical region contributing to model predictions.

Summary:
Memory constraints can significantly impact an agent's performance in navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement learning algorithms. The dilemma arises from deciding how much memory should be allocated to different internal processes, such as estimating a world model and forming a plan based on it. This study focuses on MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms to explore the effects of memory allocation on performance in both episodic and continual learning scenarios. By examining various memory allocations, the research sheds light on how different distributions of memory resources can influence the efficiency and effectiveness of learning and decision-making processes in constrained environments. <div>

Abstract: Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and decision-making. We explore how memory constraints influence an agent's performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma: how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic and continual learning settings.

Summary:
This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, a training data rephrasing strategy for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization. OAT-Rephrase leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances based on its understanding of ZO dynamics, improving performance and convergence speed. The approach comprises a dual-stage pipeline with a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge to ensure task relevance and logical consistency in rephrased data. Evaluations on multiple tasks and LLM architectures show that OAT-Rephrase significantly enhances MeZO fine-tuning, bringing it closer to first-order methods. The findings suggest that optimization-aware rephrasing is a practical and efficient enhancement for zeroth-order tuning regimes.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization (ZO) offers a memory-efficient alternative to gradient-based methods but suffers from slower convergence and unstable optimization due to noisy gradient estimates. This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, an Optimization-Aware Training data rephrasing strategy that leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances based on its understanding of the ZO dynamics, specifically MeZO, derived directly from its paper. The approach incorporates a dual-stage pipeline featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order tuning regimes.

<title>Does Multimodal Large Language Model Truly Unlearn? Stealthy MLLM Unlearning Attack</title>

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, privacy risks, unlearning methods, LLM unlearning attack, Stealthy Unlearning Attack

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and the privacy risks associated with these models memorizing sensitive personal information and photos. To address this issue, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed to reduce the retention of sensitive data. However, there is a concern regarding whether the unlearned knowledge is truly erased or just concealed within the model. A novel problem of LLM unlearning attack is introduced to recover the unlearned knowledge from MLLMs. The Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework is proposed, which utilizes a universal noise pattern to trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. Experimental results show that the SUA framework can effectively recover forgotten information from MLLMs, with the learned noise having the ability to generalize across unseen images. The use of an embedding alignment loss ensures that the attack remains semantically unnoticeable, making pixel-level perturbations difficult to detect visually. This study suggests that knowledge reappearance from unlearned MLLMs is consistent rather than an occasional failure.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model. Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.

Summary:
CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM) is a novel framework designed to enhance the causal reasoning abilities of vision-language models (VLMs). It addresses the limitations of existing VLMs in fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks by incorporating targeted counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three key training objectives: maintaining cross-modal alignment, reinforcing factual scene representations against counterfactuals, and sharpening sensitivity to causal edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CF-VLM outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art methods in compositional reasoning and generalization tasks. Additionally, it shows promise in reducing visual hallucinations, indicating improved factual consistency. Overall, CF-VLM provides a strong foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios that require reliable reasoning and interpretability.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations, indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring reliable reasoning and interpretability.

Summary: <br />
AlgoSelect introduces a framework for learning optimal algorithm selection using the Comb Operator. This operator enables interpolation between different algorithms through sigmoid-gated selection. The framework is proven to be universal, computationally efficient, and robust. It includes theoretical contributions such as a universal approximation theorem and information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds. The Comb Operator is formalized within linear operator theory, and an N-Path Comb is introduced for multi-algorithm selection. Empirical validation shows near-perfect selection with minimal samples and rapid convergence. AlgoSelect offers a theoretically grounded solution for automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability guarantees, making it applicable to AI and adaptive systems. <div>

Abstract: We introduce AlgoSelect, a principled framework for learning optimal algorithm selection from data, centered around the novel Comb Operator. Given a set of algorithms and a feature representation of problems, AlgoSelect learns to interpolate between diverse computational approaches. For pairs of algorithms, a simple sigmoid-gated selector, an instance of the Comb Operator, facilitates this interpolation. We extend this to an N-Path Comb for multiple algorithms. We prove that this framework is universal (can approximate any algorithm selector), information-theoretically optimal in its learnability (thresholds for selection converge almost surely, demonstrated via Borel-Cantelli arguments), computationally efficient, and robust. Key theoretical contributions include: (1) a universal approximation theorem demonstrating that Comb-based selectors can achieve arbitrary accuracy; (2) information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds; (3) formalization of the Comb Operator within linear operator theory, detailing its boundedness and spectral properties; (4) an N-Path Comb generalization for multi-algorithm selection; and (5) a practical learning framework for the adaptive seeding functions that guide the Comb Operator. Empirical validation on a comprehensive 20$\times$20 problem-algorithm study demonstrates near-perfect selection (99.9\%+ accuracy) with remarkably few samples and rapid convergence, revealing that $H(\text{Algorithm}|\text{Problem}) \approx 0$ in structured domains. AlgoSelect provides a theoretically grounded, practically deployable solution to automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability guarantees, with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.

<div> Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation, CLIP, ViT-B/16, domain shift, OOD abilities 

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach for Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation by enhancing CLIP's performance on challenging real-world benchmarks. Instead of relying solely on CLIP's feature space knowledge, the method introduces a side branch learning directly on the input space to complement dataset-specific knowledge. By utilizing revert attention and greedy text ensemble, the model captures dataset-specific label semantics for downstream adaptation. The fusion of text and visual features is done in a domain-aware manner using a generated domain prompt. Experimental results on 5 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, showcasing significant improvements over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with gains of +5.1 in F1 for iWildCam and +3.1% in WC Acc for FMoW. <div>
arXiv:2506.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP, solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16, performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP, this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for FMoW.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated code, deepfakes, and other synthetic content is an emerging research challenge. As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5 encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3, Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the CodeT5-Authorship architecture, the LLM-AuthorBench benchmark, and all relevant Google Colab scripts on GitHub: https://github.com/LLMauthorbench/.

<div> score matching, diffusion models, creativity, image generation, self-attention <br />
Summary: <br />
The article discusses the role of creativity in diffusion models for image generation. It explores the score matching perspective on diffusion and how it contributes to generating plausible yet distinct images. The study suggests that optimal score matching would only reproduce training samples but diffusion models with a CNN parameterized score exhibit inductive biases leading to the creation of mosaic-like images. The theory, however, does not address the impact of self-attention in this context. The research aims to extend the existing theory to include the role of self-attention in diffusion models with a CNN and final self-attention layer. It hypothesizes that self-attention can promote globally consistent arrangements of local features in generated images, beyond the patch level. Empirical verification on a specialized dataset supports this hypothesis. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how `creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g., (Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process. However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself (translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise `mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

Summary: 
The study addressed the challenge of imbalanced data in diabetes mellitus detection using copula-based data augmentation.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases, results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation, which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied four machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. Our findings indicate that XGBoost combined with A2 copula oversampling achieved the best performance improving accuracy by 4.6%, precision by 15.6%, recall by 20.4%, F1-score by 18.2% and AUC by 25.5% compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we statistically validated our results using the McNemar test. This research represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

Summary: <br />
A new decoder-only transformer model called AutomataGPT has been developed to predict and reconstruct the local update rules of cellular automata (CA) with high accuracy. The model was pretrained on a large dataset of simulated trajectories from 100 different CA rules. When tested on unseen rules from the same CA family, AutomataGPT achieved 98.5% accuracy in forecasting future states and accurately inferred the governing update rules with up to 96% functional accuracy. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer models in inferring and executing CA dynamics solely based on data, without the need for manual priors. The findings have implications for various domains such as biology, tissue engineering, physics, and AI-driven scientific discovery, by providing a data-efficient method for abstracting real-world dynamical phenomena into CA surrogates. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth. However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1 million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional (application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.

Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy. Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions. Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks, while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.

Abstract: Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising energy storage option for the current energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Fast modeling of hydrogen plume migration and pressure field evolution is crucial for UHS field management. In this study, we propose a new neural operator architecture, FFINO, as a fast surrogate model for multiphase flow problems in UHS. We parameterize experimental relative permeability curves reported in the literature and include them as key uncertainty parameters in the FFINO model. We also compare the FFINO model with the state-of-the-art FMIONet model through a comprehensive combination of metrics. Our new FFINO model has 38.1% fewer trainable parameters, 17.6% less training time, and 12% less GPU memory cost compared to FMIONet. The FFINO model also achieves a 9.8% accuracy improvement in predicting hydrogen plume in focused areas, and 18% higher RMSE in predicting pressure buildup. The inference time of the trained FFINO model is 7850 times faster than a numerical simulator, which makes it a competent substitute for numerical simulations of UHS problems with superior time efficiency.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts face unique safety alignment challenges due to their architectural complexity. Existing safety alignment strategies are inadequate for these models. The study formalizes positional vulnerability in MoE models, where safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, posing critical risks. The SAFEx framework identifies and validates safety-critical experts using the SES algorithm, categorizing them into groups responsible for harmful content detection and safe response generation. Experiments on Qwen3-MoE reveal that disabling a small subset of positional experts significantly impacts model safety, with just 12 experts causing a 22% drop in refusal rates. This illustrates the disproportionate impact of a few experts on overall safety in MoE models. <div>

Abstract: Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts have achieved substantial gains in efficiency and scalability, yet their architectural uniqueness introduces underexplored safety alignment challenges. Existing safety alignment strategies, predominantly designed for dense models, are ill-suited to address MoE-specific vulnerabilities. In this work, we formalize and systematically study MoE model's positional vulnerability - the phenomenon where safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, revealing critical risks inherent to MoE architectures. To this end, we present SAFEx, an analytical framework that robustly identifies, characterizes, and validates the safety-critical experts using a novel Stability-based Expert Selection (SES) algorithm. Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of safety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those responsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response generation. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the recently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety mechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling these experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful requests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that disabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal rate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set of experts on overall model safety.

Summary:
In the study, the researchers explored the effectiveness of inference-time techniques in improving the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), especially those trained with reinforcement learning (RL). They found that decoding strategies like majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification enhanced VLM reasoning performance, with generation-reliant methods showing higher gains than verification-reliant methods. However, the self-correction behavior observed in RL-trained models did not lead to measurable improvements. The study uncovered that RL-trained VLMs lack robust self-verification capabilities across visual and textual modalities. Extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework identified this deficiency as a key issue. Overall, the research highlights the importance of effective inference-time techniques in enhancing VLM reasoning capabilities and the need to improve self-verification capabilities in RL-trained models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs), particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

Summary:
Federated learning faces challenges in interpretability and explainability, which are addressed by the introduction of Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs). This novel approach combines Neural Additive Models' feature-specific learning with the decentralized nature of federated learning, ensuring interpretability while enhancing privacy and model efficiency. FedNAMs train on local data from multiple devices, reducing risks associated with centralization and improving model robustness. Studies on various classification tasks demonstrate FedNAMs' strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks. Important predictive features are identified at both client and global levels, offering insights such as the critical features for wine quality, heart disease, and iris classification. This approach not only strengthens privacy and model efficiency but also improves interpretability and robustness across datasets. FedNAMs provide insights into both highly and low interpretable features, making them valuable in sectors like finance and healthcare. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs) approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks, using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on causes of highly and low interpretable features.

Summary: 
Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning techniques aim to reduce the computational and storage costs of large neural networks. However, traditional optimization methods like heavy ball momentum and Adam face challenges when training low-rank parameterizations due to the geometric nature of the optimization landscape. This can lead to difficulty in converging to local optima. To address this issue, novel training strategies based on dynamical low-rank approximation are introduced in this work. By incorporating geometric structure into the optimization process, these new methods show faster convergence and improved validation metrics within specified parameter budgets. Through numerical experiments, the effectiveness of these optimized methods is validated, showcasing their potential to enhance training processes for low-rank parameterizations.

arXiv:2506.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning have recently emerged as promising techniques for reducing the computational and storage costs of large neural networks. Training low-rank parameterizations typically relies on conventional optimizers such as heavy ball momentum methods or Adam. In this work, we identify and analyze potential difficulties that these training methods encounter when used to train low-rank parameterizations of weights. In particular, we show that classical momentum methods can struggle to converge to a local optimum due to the geometry of the underlying optimization landscape. To address this, we introduce novel training strategies derived from dynamical low-rank approximation, which explicitly account for the underlying geometric structure. Our approach leverages and combines tools from dynamical low-rank approximation and momentum-based optimization to design optimizers that respect the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. We validate our methods through numerical experiments, demonstrating faster convergence, and stronger validation metrics at given parameter budgets.

Summary: 
- The study focuses on improving few-shot classification tasks using metric-based models by proposing episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning methods like RDFT, IDFT, and ADFT.
- These methods aim to utilize the labeled support samples more effectively, enabling the fine-tuning of the metric space itself based on the current episode's classes.
- To prevent overfitting due to limited data in each task, the authors suggest training the model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework.
- The proposed approach was tested on three audio datasets, namely ESC-50, Speech Commands V2, and Medley-solos-DB, showcasing consistent performance improvements across different audio domains.
- The experimental results indicate that the approach enhances the performance of various metric-based models, particularly attention-based models, highlighting its potential for rapid adaptation and generalization in few-shot classification tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In few-shot classification tasks (so-called episodes), a small set of labeled support samples is provided during inference to aid the classification of unlabeled query samples. Metric-based models typically operate by computing similarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric space, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled support samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity comparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space itself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a series of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning methods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning (RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and Augmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo support-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for non-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in each task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such fine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the metric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With the combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly adapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding overfitting. We validate our approach on three audio datasets from diverse domains, namely ESC-50 (environmental sounds), Speech Commands V2 (spoken keywords), and Medley-solos-DB (musical instrument). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance for all evaluated metric-based models (especially for attention-based models) and generalizes well across different audio domains.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management, personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context, combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible. In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed, considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views, and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained the best results.

Summary: 
This study introduces improvements to Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adapting pretrained policies with corrective actions. The proposed method enhances sample efficiency and is compatible with stochastic base policies. By incorporating uncertainty estimates of the base policy, exploration can focus on areas where confidence is lacking. Additionally, a modification to off-policy learning allows better handling of stochastic policies by observing base actions. Evaluation on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL shows significant improvement over existing baselines, including finetuning and demo-augmented RL methods. The algorithm outperforms other residual RL methods, demonstrating robustness in simulation benchmarks. Furthermore, real-world deployment showcases the effectiveness of zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. <div>

Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods, and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Summary:
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing, exacerbated by trainable linear transformations. Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC) eliminates these transformations but weakens expressive capacity. Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT) addresses this trade-off by progressively training deep GCNs, stabilizing optimization, adapting shallow layers, and ensuring smooth integration of new layers. LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance in vanilla GCN, improving accuracy in 32-layer settings. It seamlessly integrates with existing methods like PairNorm and ContraNorm for enhanced performance in deeper networks. This architecture-agnostic training framework offers scalability for deep GCNs. The code for LGT is available on GitHub for reproducibility. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast, Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations, maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the model's expressive capacity.
  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1) layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2) low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and (3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method, LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].

Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in the aerospace field, enabling the learning of solution operators that generalize across parameter spaces. However, existing methods either suffer from limited expressiveness due to fixed basis/coefficient designs, or face computational challenges due to the high dimensionality of the parameter-to-weight mapping space. We present LFR-PINO, a novel physics-informed neural operator that introduces two key innovations: (1) a layered hypernetwork architecture that enables specialized parameter generation for each network layer, and (2) a frequency-domain reduction strategy that significantly reduces parameter count while preserving essential spectral features. This design enables efficient learning of a universal PDE solver through pre-training, capable of directly handling new equations while allowing optional fine-tuning for enhanced precision. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on four representative PDE problems, where LFR-PINO achieves 22.8%-68.7% error reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, frequency-domain reduction strategy reduces memory usage by 28.6%-69.3% compared to Hyper-PINNs while maintaining solution accuracy, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and solution fidelity.

Summary:
This paper introduces new algorithms for active multi-distribution learning and provides improved upper and lower bounds for label complexity in both distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings. In the near-realizable setting, the paper establishes upper bounds based on factors such as the maximum disagreement coefficient among distributions, VC dimension of the hypothesis class, multi-distribution error, and target excess error. The research shows that the bounds in the realizable setting are information-theoretically optimal and highlights the importance of certain terms for proper learners in the agnostic setting. Additionally, the paper also presents an instance-dependent sample complexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that transitions between realizable and agnostic regimes smoothly. These findings contribute to advancing the understanding and development of algorithms for active multi-distribution learning. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-distribution learning extends agnostic Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning to the setting in which a family of $k$ distributions, $\{D_i\}_{i\in[k]}$, is considered and a classifier's performance is measured by its error under the worst distribution. This problem has attracted a lot of recent interests due to its applications in collaborative learning, fairness, and robustness. Despite a rather complete picture of sample complexity of passive multi-distribution learning, research on active multi-distribution learning remains scarce, with algorithms whose optimality remaining unknown.
  In this paper, we develop new algorithms for active multi-distribution learning and establish improved label complexity upper and lower bounds, in distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings. Specifically, in the near-realizable setting we prove an upper bound of $\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\Bigr)$ and $\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\Bigl(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\frac{\nu^2}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)+\frac{k\nu}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)$ in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively, where $\theta_{\max}$ is the maximum disagreement coefficient among the $k$ distributions, $d$ is the VC dimension of the hypothesis class, $\nu$ is the multi-distribution error of the best hypothesis, and $\varepsilon$ is the target excess error. Moreover, we show that the bound in the realizable setting is information-theoretically optimal and that the $k\nu/\varepsilon^2$ term in the agnostic setting is fundamental for proper learners. We also establish instance-dependent sample complexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that smoothly interpolates between realizable and agnostic regimes~\citep{blum2017collaborative,zhang2024optimal}, which may be of independent interest.

<div> quantized AllReduce, Large Language Models, efficient, dynamic block-wise, numerical instability

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach called EQuARX for efficiently quantizing AllReduce operations in Large Language Models (LLMs) on TPUs. The EQuARX method utilizes TPU-friendly quantization and deep pipelining to achieve a 1.8X speedup in AllReduce performance compared to the baseline BF16 method, across various network topologies. Additionally, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B and Gemma 3 12B models by 1.25X and 1.1X, respectively, with minimal impact on model quality. This innovative solution addresses the challenge of efficiently distributing LLMs across multiple accelerator devices by optimizing the AllReduce process, allowing for significant performance improvements without sacrificing model quality or stability. <div>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become highly influential, their enormous scale presents significant deployment challenges. Efficiently serving these models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator devices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device communication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations with minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like AllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved, which can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In this work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce within the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization and deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision achieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network topologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by 1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on quality.

<div> Keywords: chronic diseases, machine learning, self-assessment, explainability, preventive care

Summary:
Chronic diseases are a significant public health concern, requiring effective preventive strategies due to their long-term nature. Current machine learning models often rely on medical test data, limiting their applicability for proactive self-assessment. This study introduces deep learning models that predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using personal and lifestyle factors, enabling accessible preventive care. By utilizing SHAP-based explainability, the models identify influential features and validate them against established medical literature, enhancing trustworthiness. The alignment between the models' features and medical literature across various diseases reinforces their reliability. This research sets a groundwork for developing reliable machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care, emphasizing the importance of ethical and responsible use in healthcare settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Chronic diseases require preventive strategies due to their long-term, incurable nature.
- Machine learning models often lack accessibility for proactive self-assessment.
- Deep learning models using personal and lifestyle factors predict the risk of 13 chronic diseases.

Abstract: Chronic diseases are long-term, manageable, yet typically incurable conditions, highlighting the need for effective preventive strategies. Machine learning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases. However, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose levels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment. Additionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be explainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine learning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated against established medical literature, reducing confidence in their reliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and lifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care. Importantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential model features and validate them against established medical literature. Our results show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features and established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness. Critically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases, indicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for chronic disease prediction. This work lays the foundation for developing trustworthy machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care. Future research can explore other approaches for models' trustworthiness and discuss how the models can be used ethically and responsibly.

Summary:
This article discusses the security implications of dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) and the potential vulnerabilities introduced by input-dependent execution pathways. These DDLSs are designed for efficient inference under strict constraints but may be exploited by adversaries to degrade system efficiency, leading to excessive latency, energy usage, and denial-of-service attacks. The study identifies gaps in attack strategies and defense mechanisms, emphasizing the need to investigate efficiency attacks on modern DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to mitigate adversarial threats. Efforts are focused on preserving system robustness under adversarial conditions to ensure reliable and secure operation in real-world environments. <div>

Abstract: The growing deployment of deep learning models in real-world environments has intensified the need for efficient inference under strict latency and resource constraints. To meet these demands, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have emerged, offering input-adaptive computation to optimize runtime efficiency. While these systems succeed in reducing cost, their dynamic nature introduces subtle and underexplored security risks. In particular, input-dependent execution pathways create opportunities for adversaries to degrade efficiency, resulting in excessive latency, energy usage, and potential denial-of-service in time-sensitive deployments. This work investigates the security implications of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs and reveals how current systems expose efficiency vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs. Through a survey of existing attack strategies, we identify gaps in the coverage of emerging model architectures and limitations in current defense mechanisms. Building on these insights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial conditions.

<div> Keywords: time series forecasting, deep learning, large language models, multi-prompt information, cross-modal alignment

Summary:
The article introduces LLM-Prompt, a framework for time series forecasting using large language models. It addresses the shortcomings of existing LLM-based methods by integrating multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment. The framework includes a unified paradigm for textual prompt formulation and considers modality discrepancies between textual prompts and time series data. It utilizes learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts to enhance LLMs' understanding of the forecasting task. Additionally, a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module are designed to fuse temporal and textual information. Comprehensive evaluations on public datasets and carbon emission datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-Prompt in time series forecasting. <div>
arXiv:2506.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, adaptive selection, contextual bandit, online setting, sublinear regret

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given user query. In an online setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query refinement, the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection arises without access to offline datasets or model internals. A contextual bandit framework is proposed for sequential LLM selection under unstructured prompt dynamics, achieving sublinear regret without relying on future context prediction. Budget-aware and positionally-aware extensions are introduced to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early high-quality responses. The algorithms are theoretically grounded, requiring no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experimental results show that these methods outperform existing LLM routing strategies in accuracy and cost-efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution: the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction) extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing strategies in both accuracy and cost-efficiency, validating the power of contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.

<div> personalized utility functions, hypernetwork, ensemble learning, ride-hailing systems, prediction accuracy

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel method for predicting ride-hailing drivers' decision-making behaviors through personalized utility functions, utilizing hypernetworks and ensemble learning. Traditional models like Random Utility Maximization often overlook non-linear relationships among attributes and fail to address individual drivers' unique preferences. The proposed approach dynamically generates weights for a linear utility function using hypernetworks, capturing non-linear interactions effectively. By training an ensemble of hypernetworks on various data segments, the model enhances adaptability and generalization while reducing overfitting. Validation using real-world data showcases the model's accuracy in predicting driver utility as well as its ability to quantify uncertainty. The model not only accurately predicts drivers' decision-making but also offers insights into the personalized preferences that drive their acceptance choices, balancing explainability and uncertainty quantification effectively. <div>
arXiv:2506.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ride-hailing systems, drivers decide whether to accept or reject ride requests based on factors such as order characteristics, traffic conditions, and personal preferences. Accurately predicting these decisions is essential for improving the efficiency and reliability of these systems. Traditional models, such as the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach, typically predict drivers' decisions by assuming linear correlations among attributes. However, these models often fall short because they fail to account for non-linear interactions between attributes and do not cater to the unique, personalized preferences of individual drivers. In this paper, we develop a method for learning personalized utility functions using hypernetwork and ensemble learning. Hypernetworks dynamically generate weights for a linear utility function based on trip request data and driver profiles, capturing the non-linear relationships. An ensemble of hypernetworks trained on different data segments further improve model adaptability and generalization by introducing controlled randomness, thereby reducing over-fitting. We validate the performance of our ensemble hypernetworks model in terms of prediction accuracy and uncertainty estimation in a real-world dataset. The results demonstrate that our approach not only accurately predicts each driver's utility but also effectively balances the needs for explainability and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, our model serves as a powerful tool for revealing the personalized preferences of different drivers, clearly illustrating which attributes largely impact their rider acceptance decisions.

<title>FaithfulSAE: Towards Capturing Faithful Features with Sparse Autoencoders without External Dataset Dependencies</title>

<div> Keywords: Sparse Autoencoders, Fake Features, Dataset, Interpretability, Model-internal features 

Summary: 
FaithfulSAE is proposed as a method to address the instability and limited feature capture of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) when trained on external datasets. By training SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset, FaithfulSAEs achieve greater stability across initialization seeds and outperform SAEs trained on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task. The method results in a lower Fake Feature Ratio in most models, indicating a more accurate representation of the model's internal activations. FaithfulSAEs eliminate the reliance on potentially out-of-distribution data, advancing the interpretability of large language models by better capturing model-internal features. The research highlights the importance of the SAE training dataset in improving the interpretability and reliability of SAE feature decomposition. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features. However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features, which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of SAE training datasets.

Summary:<br />
The article explores the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model extraction attacks (MEAs) and their potential for cost-effective model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. It discusses the importance of adaptive node querying strategies in research, especially in scenarios where labeling data is expensive. The proposed node querying strategy is tailored to situations with limited initial nodes and prohibits bulk queries. Through iterative refinement over multiple learning cycles, historical feedback is leveraged to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets show the superiority of the approach in accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. The study emphasizes the need for ethical and efficient GNN acquisition methods to support low-resource research environments. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research, particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to support low-resource research environments.

<div> Keywords: evolving domain generalization, causal representation learning, structural causal model, time-aware, sequential VAE

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach called Static-Dynamic Causal Representation Learning (SYNC) to address evolving patterns in data distribution for improved model generalization. SYNC utilizes a time-aware structural causal model to incorporate dynamic causal factors and mechanism drifts, aiming to avoid spurious correlations between task-irrelevant factors and the target. By integrating information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework, SYNC effectively captures evolving patterns and preserves intra-class compactness of causal factors across different domains. The method is theoretically shown to produce optimal causal predictors for each time domain. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SYNC outperforms existing methods in achieving superior temporal generalization performance. <div>
arXiv:2506.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization (EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose \textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning (\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains. Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization performance.

Summary: 
This work introduces a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts (PIMOE) network designed to predict battery degradation trajectories using limited, real-world data in a single cycle. The network utilizes an adaptive multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes and generate latent degradation trend embeddings, which are then used for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on a large dataset of batteries and cycles, PIMOE achieves high accuracy with minimal computational time compared to existing models. It supports 150-cycle forecasts with low average and maximum errors and can effectively operate with limited training data. This framework offers a practical solution for assessing, optimizing, and integrating retired electric vehicle batteries into sustainable energy systems without the need for historical data. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts (PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial, field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207 batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time. Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50% average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into the sustainable energy landscape.

Abstract: Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context. These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes" supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis, unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.

Abstract: Studies in neuroscience have shown that biological synapses follow a log-normal distribution whose transitioning can be explained by noisy multiplicative dynamics. Biological networks can function stably even under dynamically fluctuating conditions arising due to unreliable synaptic transmissions. Here we ask: Is it possible to design similar multiplicative training in artificial neural networks? To answer this question, we derive a Bayesian learning rule that assumes log-normal posterior distributions over weights which gives rise to a new Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD) algorithm. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates with both noise and regularization applied multiplicatively. The method is as easy to implement as Adam and only requires one additional vector to store. Our results show that LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch under low-precision forward operations for Vision Transformer and GPT-2. These results suggest that multiplicative dynamics, a biological feature, may enable stable low-precision inference and learning on future energy-efficient hardware.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets, these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model. It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks enables synergistic learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities, confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms, implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes. This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.

<title>Toward Autonomous UI Exploration: The UIExplorer Benchmark</title>

Abstract: Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode (granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment. We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2% of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000 steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.

<title>Beyond instruction-conditioning, MoTE: Mixture of Task Experts for Multi-task Embedding Models</title>

Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning (\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings. Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or number of active parameters.

<title>SING: SDE Inference via Natural Gradients</title>

Abstract: Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable, motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI). However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from slow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We provide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets, including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.

Abstract: Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of this generative solution.

Abstract: Recent literature has examined the relationship between the curvature of the loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of overparameterized networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We show that when the common neural network model (neural network with exponential family negative log likelihood loss) is calibrated, and its prediction error and its confidence in the prediction are not correlated with the first and the second derivatives of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect our flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.

<title>Actionable Interpretability via Causal Hypergraphs: Unravelling Batch Size Effects in Deep Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17826</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.17826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity. Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics. Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT, PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.

<title>Aligning Frozen LLMs by Reinforcement Learning: An Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17828</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible. In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions, and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

<title>Causal Spherical Hypergraph Networks for Modelling Social Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse), and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under uncertainty in dynamic social environments.

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real, high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries: SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN, TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio. Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility, assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case. The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the 1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use, making it more accessible for practitioners.

Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$ is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size. Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning in energy-constrained settings. Our codes are available at https://github.com/zser092/PAPI_FILES.

arXiv:2506.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions. We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies: beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased. Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission, storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101 with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately 78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+ offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+ delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios. Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized predictive modeling.

<title>Choice of Scoring Rules for Indirect Elicitation of Properties with Parametric Assumptions</title>

Abstract: People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a random event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality of predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at the precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the property. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the characterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little literature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at hand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of properties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function of several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted sum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction to a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to different constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the choice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which choice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an interesting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target property changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best configuration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand how it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and then provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties and of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly interprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we especially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be understood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear approximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the parametric space.

Abstract: Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network (GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs. Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of 92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs

<title>Permutation Equivariant Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.

Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions, producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent (Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to a creation of very successful, but by no means humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability. It results in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and answer confidence/reliability measures. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set of synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of La Ni\~na and El Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training - a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction tools.

<title>Adapting Vision-Language Models for Evaluating World Models</title>

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

<title>h-calibration: Rethinking Classifier Recalibration with Probabilistic Error-Bounded Objective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17968</link>

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods, binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration. Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

Abstract: We propose LQ-SGD (Low-Rank Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent), an efficient communication gradient compression algorithm designed for distributed training. LQ-SGD further develops on the basis of PowerSGD by incorporating the low-rank approximation and log-quantization techniques, which drastically reduce the communication overhead, while still ensuring the convergence speed of training and model accuracy. In addition, LQ-SGD and other compression-based methods show stronger resistance to gradient inversion than traditional SGD, providing a more robust and efficient optimization path for distributed learning systems.

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees. Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations. Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.

<title>Data Curation Matters: Model Collapse and Spurious Shift Performance Prediction from Training on Uncurated Text Embeddings</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) derived from raw tabular data can lead to a severe failure mode known as model collapse, where predictions converge to a single class regardless of input. By comparing models trained with identical hyper-parameter configurations on both raw tabular data and their TE-derived counterparts, we find that collapse is a consistent failure mode in the latter setting. We introduce a set of metrics that capture the extent of model collapse, offering a new perspective on TE quality as a proxy for data curation. Our results reveal that TE alone does not effectively function as a curation layer - and that their quality significantly influences downstream learning. More insidiously, we observe that the presence of model collapse can yield artificially inflated and spurious Accuracy-on-the-Line correlation. These findings highlight the need for more nuanced curation and evaluation of embedding-based representations, particularly in out-of-distribution settings.

Abstract: Longitudinal data is commonly utilised across various domains, such as health, biomedical, education and survey studies. This ubiquity has led to a rise in statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods for Longitudinal Data Classification (LDC). However, the intricate nature of the data, characterised by its multi-dimensionality, causes instance-level heterogeneity and temporal correlations that add to the complexity of longitudinal data analysis. Additionally, LDC accuracy is often hampered by the pervasiveness of missing values in longitudinal data. Despite ongoing research that draw on the generative power and utility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address the missing data problem, critical considerations include statistical assumptions surrounding longitudinal data and missingness within it, as well as other data-level challenges like class imbalance and mixed data types that impact longitudinal data imputation (LDI) and the subsequent LDC process in GANs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how GANs have been applied in LDI, with a focus whether GANS have adequately addressed fundamental assumptions about the data from a LDC perspective. We propose a categorisation of main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of methods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions. Our findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve usability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need for more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges presented by longitudinal data with missing values. By synthesising current knowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this survey aims to guide future research efforts in developing more effective GAN-based solutions to address LDC challenges.

Abstract: Understanding how information propagates through Transformer models is a key challenge for interpretability. In this work, we study the effects of minimal token perturbations on the embedding space. In our experiments, we analyze the frequency of which tokens yield to minimal shifts, highlighting that rare tokens usually lead to larger shifts. Moreover, we study how perturbations propagate across layers, demonstrating that input information is increasingly intermixed in deeper layers. Our findings validate the common assumption that the first layers of a model can be used as proxies for model explanations. Overall, this work introduces the combination of token perturbations and shifts on the embedding space as a powerful tool for model interpretability.

<title>Generalization under Byzantine &amp; Poisoning Attacks: Tight Stability Bounds in Robust Distributed Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust distributed learning algorithms aim to maintain good performance in distributed and federated settings, even in the presence of misbehaving workers. Two primary threat models have been studied: Byzantine attacks, where misbehaving workers can send arbitrarily corrupted updates, and data poisoning attacks, where misbehavior is limited to manipulation of local training data. While prior work has shown comparable optimization error under both threat models, a fundamental question remains open: How do these threat models impact generalization? Empirical evidence suggests a gap between the two threat models, yet it remains unclear whether it is fundamental or merely an artifact of suboptimal attacks. In this work, we present the first theoretical investigation into this problem, formally showing that Byzantine attacks are intrinsically more harmful to generalization than data poisoning. Specifically, we prove that: (i) under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of a robust distributed learning algorithm, with optimal optimization error, degrades by an additive factor of $\varTheta ( \frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ the number of misbehaving workers out of $n$; and (ii) In contrast, under Byzantine attacks, the degradation is in $\mathcal{O} \big( \sqrt{ \frac{f}{n-2f}} \big)$.This difference in stability leads to a generalization error gap that is especially significant as $f$ approaches its maximum value $\frac{n}{2}$.

<title>Why Do Some Language Models Fake Alignment While Others Don't?</title>

Abstract: Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals. Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in alignment faking.

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their ``black box" nature raises concerns about transparency and reliability. Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning, Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and code are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TAB.

Abstract: Meta learning aims at learning how to solve tasks, and thus it allows to estimate models that can be quickly adapted to new scenarios. This work explores distributionally robust minimization in meta learning for system identification. Standard meta learning approaches optimize the expected loss, overlooking task variability. We use an alternative approach, adopting a distributionally robust optimization paradigm that prioritizes high-loss tasks, enhancing performance in worst-case scenarios. Evaluated on a meta model trained on a class of synthetic dynamical systems and tested in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, the proposed approach allows to reduce failures in safety-critical applications.

<title>RL for Reasoning by Adaptively Revealing Rationales</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to partial solutions.

Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so, the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved. To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance

<title>Routing Mamba: Scaling State Space Models with Mixture-of-Experts Projection</title>

Abstract: Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However, efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers. At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.

Abstract: This work introduces 4 novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods for association rule mining (ARM): Gaussian process-based association rule mining (GPAR), Bayesian ARM (BARM), multi-armed bandit based ARM (MAB-ARM), and reinforcement learning based association rule mining (RLAR). These methods depart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating prior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic inference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to model item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled inference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen itemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and optional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification through full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM, including its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the itemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a generalizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these approaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for discovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, while also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and interpretability. These innovations mark a significant shift from static, frequency-driven paradigms, offering some prior and dependency-informed, uncertainty-aware or scalable ARM frameworks for diverse application domains such as retail, geography, finance, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention, due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited practical value.

Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process, or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling. Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the \textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.

<title>Memba: Membrane-driven Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Mamba</title>

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful alternatives to attention-based Transformers, with Mamba demonstrating impressive efficiency and scalability. As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt pre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs. However, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT methods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To address this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach specifically designed for Mamba. Memba introduces Leaky Integrate Membrane (LIM) neurons as bio-inspired gating mechanisms that naturally accumulate membrane potentials over time, enhancing selective information retention. By strategically combining LIM neurons with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) and cross-layer membrane transfer, our approach significantly improves Mamba's temporal modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments across language and vision tasks demonstrate that Memba achieves substantial improvements over existing PEFT methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Yale/Memba.

<title>Online Learning of Whittle Indices for Restless Bandits with Non-Stationary Transition Kernels</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18186</link>

Abstract: We consider optimal resource allocation for restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) in unknown, non-stationary settings. RMABs are PSPACE-hard to solve optimally, even when all parameters are known. The Whittle index policy is known to achieve asymptotic optimality for a large class of such problems, while remaining computationally efficient. In many practical settings, however, the transition kernels required to compute the Whittle index are unknown and non-stationary. In this work, we propose an online learning algorithm for Whittle indices in this setting. Our algorithm first predicts current transition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper confidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data over a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the predicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper confidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of episodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over time (rate upper bounded by $\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our proposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain knowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning process. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces Decoupled Supervised Learning with Information Regularization (DeInfoReg), a novel approach that transforms a long gradient flow into multiple shorter ones, thereby mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. Integrating a pipeline strategy, DeInfoReg enables model parallelization across multiple GPUs, significantly improving training throughput. We compare our proposed method with standard backpropagation and other gradient flow decomposition techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of polymers with desired properties by aiding in tasks such as virtual screening via property prediction. However, progress in polymer ML is hampered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, which are necessary for training supervised ML models. In this work, we study the use of the very recent 'Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture' (JEPA), a type of architecture for self-supervised learning (SSL), on polymer molecular graphs to understand whether pretraining with the proposed SSL strategy improves downstream performance when labeled data is scarce. Our results indicate that JEPA-based self-supervised pretraining on polymer graphs enhances downstream performance, particularly when labeled data is very scarce, achieving improvements across all tested datasets.

<title>These are Not All the Features You are Looking For: A Fundamental Bottleneck In Supervised Pretraining</title>

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically, present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards addressing this challenge.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models' evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically, AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

arXiv:2506.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers, thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem, increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality. To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.

<title>Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation: Bridging the Capacity Gap Between Teacher and Student</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) provides an effective way to improve the performance of a student network under the guidance of pre-trained teachers. However, this approach usually brings in a large capacity gap between teacher and student networks, limiting the distillation gains. Previous methods addressing this problem either discard accurate knowledge representation or fail to dynamically adjust the transferred knowledge, which is less effective in addressing the capacity gap problem and hinders students from achieving comparable performance with the pre-trained teacher. In this work, we extend the ideology of prompt-based learning to address the capacity gap problem, and propose Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation (DFPT-KD), which replaces the pre-trained teacher with a novel dual-forward path teacher to supervise the learning of student. The key to DFPT-KD is prompt-based tuning, i.e., establishing an additional prompt-based forward path within the pre-trained teacher and optimizing it with the pre-trained teacher frozen to make the transferred knowledge compatible with the representation ability of the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained students performing better than the vanilla KD. To make the transferred knowledge better compatible with the representation abilities of the student, we further fine-tune the whole prompt-based forward path, yielding a novel distillation approach dubbed DFPT-KD+. By extensive experiments, it is shown that DFPT-KD+ improves upon DFPT-KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy performance.

Abstract: Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However, their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover, Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.

<title>RLPR: Extrapolating RLVR to General Domains without Verifiers</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama, and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6 points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points across seven benchmarks.

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) provides a promising technology for accurate subsurface object detection. In particular, it has shown promise for detecting landmines with low metal content. However, the ground bounce (GB) that is present in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between soil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection performance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated using both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are proposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled as the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The observations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the down-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically to accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated with the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data. The prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating information from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB surface remains smooth. The proposed algorithms are verified in experiments utilizing real data, and their performances are compared with other GB tracking approaches. We demonstrate that improved GB tracking contributes to improved performance for the landmine detection problem.

Abstract: Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$ sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA's efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32% trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA. Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for efficient foundation model adaptation.

Experimental results demonstrate that our solution significantly improves contextual coherence, reduces memory overhead, and enhances response quality, showcasing its potential for real-time applications in interactive systems.

Abstract: For the ACMMM25 challenge, we present a practical engineering approach to multimedia news source verification, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o as the backbone of our pipeline. Our method processes images and videos through a streamlined sequence of steps: First, we generate metadata using general-purpose queries via Google tools, capturing relevant content and links. Multimedia data is then segmented, cleaned, and converted into frames, from which we select the top-K most informative frames. These frames are cross-referenced with metadata to identify consensus or discrepancies. Additionally, audio transcripts are extracted for further verification. Noticeably, the entire pipeline is automated using GPT-4o through prompt engineering, with human intervention limited to final validation.

Abstract: Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research, leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG (ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs. By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable down-stream applications in causal discovery.

Abstract: Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such as image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed, which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability, that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future improvements.

Abstract: Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency, particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing physical principles of ray-surface interactions.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks, yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.

Abstract: We introduce Confucius3-Math, an open-source large language model with 14B parameters that (1) runs efficiently on a single consumer-grade GPU; (2) achieves SOTA performances on a range of mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming many models with significantly larger sizes. In particular, as part of our mission to enhancing education and knowledge dissemination with AI, Confucius3-Math is specifically committed to mathematics learning for Chinese K-12 students and educators. Built via post-training with large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), Confucius3-Math aligns with national curriculum and excels at solving main-stream Chinese K-12 mathematical problems with low cost. In this report we share our development recipe, the challenges we encounter and the techniques we develop to overcome them. In particular, we introduce three technical innovations: Targeted Entropy Regularization, Recent Sample Recovery and Policy-Specific Hardness Weighting. These innovations encompass a new entropy regularization, a novel data scheduling policy, and an improved group-relative advantage estimator. Collectively, they significantly stabilize the RL training, improve data efficiency, and boost performance. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of building strong reasoning models in a particular domain at low cost. We open-source our model and code at https://github.com/netease-youdao/Confucius3-Math.

<title>Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs for Interpretable Learning and Symbolic Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior, achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.

<title>Controlled Generation with Equivariant Variational Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models, or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.

<title>SlimMoE: Structured Compression of Large MoE Models via Expert Slimming and Distillation</title>

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE (3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE architectures. We make our models publicly available at https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-mini-MoE-instruct and https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-tiny-MoE-instruct .

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14% less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics, we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by better representing them in their logical formulations.

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis and monitoring rely increasingly on high-throughput image data, yet conventional clustering methods lack the flexibility to accommodate evolving cellular patterns and quantify uncertainty in real time. We introduce Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of 0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network, enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either filtered or the relevant input data is marked.

Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various environment types, including the Atari-5 benchmark.

Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this, we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the implementations used in this paper can be found at https://github.com/IBM/analog-nas/tree/main/analognasbench.

<title>PuckTrick: A Library for Making Synthetic Data More Realistic</title>

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for decision-making requires high-quality training data. However, access to real-world datasets is often restricted due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and incomplete data availability. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a viable alternative, enabling the creation of artificial datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real data while ensuring privacy compliance. Despite its advantages, synthetic data is often overly clean and lacks real-world imperfections, such as missing values, noise, outliers, and misclassified labels, which can significantly impact model generalization and robustness. To address this limitation, we introduce Pucktrick, a Python library designed to systematically contaminate synthetic datasets by introducing controlled errors. The library supports multiple error types, including missing data, noisy values, outliers, label misclassification, duplication, and class imbalance, offering a structured approach to evaluating ML model resilience under real-world data imperfections. Pucktrick provides two contamination modes: one for injecting errors into clean datasets and another for further corrupting already contaminated datasets. Through extensive experiments on real-world financial datasets, we evaluate the impact of systematic data contamination on model performance. Our findings demonstrate that ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained on purely synthetic, error-free data, particularly for tree-based and linear models such as SVMs and Extra Trees.

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs. ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points, which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT (Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer), a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior. Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$ for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.

<title>Federated Learning from Molecules to Processes: A Perspective</title>

Abstract: We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos, hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering. Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for future industrial applications.

Abstract: We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences, allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows, induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii) the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed behaviors.

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations. These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap, training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap, inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

arXiv:2506.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control, with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal dynamics from population data.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, the softmax parametrization is the standard approach for policies over discrete action spaces. However, it fails to capture the order relationship between actions. Motivated by a real-world industrial problem, we propose a novel policy parametrization based on ordinal regression models adapted to the reinforcement learning setting. Our approach addresses practical challenges, and numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in real applications and in continuous action tasks, where discretizing the action space and applying the ordinal policy yields competitive performance.

Abstract: Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

Abstract: Equivariant models leverage prior knowledge on symmetries to improve predictive performance, but misspecified architectural constraints can harm it instead. While work has explored learning or relaxing constraints, selecting among pretrained models with varying symmetry biases remains challenging. We examine this model selection task from an uncertainty-aware perspective, comparing frequentist (via Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (via the marginal likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation. We find that uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently. We attribute this to a mismatch in Bayesian and geometric notions of model complexity, and discuss possible remedies. Our findings point towards the potential of uncertainty in guiding symmetry-aware model selection.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.

Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally, the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises. Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical evaluation of various clustering tasks.

<title>Federated Loss Exploration for Improved Convergence on Non-IID Data</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration (FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters. This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client scenario. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the art FL algorithms demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome critical barriers in diverse FL applications.

<title>On Union-Closedness of Language Generation</title>

Abstract: We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025]. While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions (uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for uncountable collections.
  Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of boosting.
  Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li, Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in the growing area of language generation.

<title>SaGIF: Improving Individual Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Similarity Encoding</title>

Abstract: Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives: topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs. Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZzoomD/SaGIF.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and modality-specific representations for each utterance remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation (MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JieLi-dd/MAGTKD.

Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs, optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However, many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context, and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs. parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware execution in LLM serving pipelines.

<title>Towards Group Fairness with Multiple Sensitive Attributes in Federated Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: The deep integration of foundation models (FM) with federated learning (FL) enhances personalization and scalability for diverse downstream tasks, making it crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare. Achieving group fairness has become an increasingly prominent issue in the era of federated foundation models (FFMs), since biases in sensitive attributes might lead to inequitable treatment for under-represented demographic groups. Existing studies mostly focus on achieving fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute. This renders them unable to provide clear interpretability of dependencies among multiple sensitive attributes which is required to achieve group fairness. Our paper takes the first attempt towards a causal analysis of the relationship between group fairness across various sensitive attributes in the FFM. We extend the FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously and quantify the causal effect behind the group fairness through causal discovery and inference. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness, offering insights into interpretability towards building trustworthy and fair FFM systems.

Abstract: Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems \emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator $\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be approximated only by learning.

Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.

Abstract: We introduce ContinualFlow, a principled framework for targeted unlearning in generative models via Flow Matching. Our method leverages an energy-based reweighting loss to softly subtract undesired regions of the data distribution without retraining from scratch or requiring direct access to the samples to be unlearned. Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning process. We prove that this induces gradients equivalent to Flow Matching toward a soft mass-subtracted target, and validate the framework through experiments on 2D and image domains, supported by interpretable visualizations and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification model used in BMW Group production facilities.

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions, where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content, making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate 5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing communication and computational overhead.

Abstract: In the study of drug function and precision medicine, identifying new drug-microbe associations is crucial. However, current methods isolate association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial Learning method between the association network view and different similarity views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in predicting potential drug-microbe associations.

Abstract: Multi-agent control problems involving a large number of agents with competing and time-varying objectives are increasingly prevalent in applications across robotics, economics, and energy systems. In this paper, we study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems with disturbances. In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, we consider an online setting where disturbances are adversarial and where each agent seeks to minimize its own, adversarial sequence of convex losses. In this setting, we investigate the robustness of gradient-based controllers from single-agent online control, with a particular focus on understanding how individual regret guarantees are influenced by the number of agents in the system. Under minimal communication assumptions, we prove near-optimal sublinear regret bounds that hold uniformly for all agents. Finally, when the objectives of the agents are aligned, we show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying potential game for which we derive equilibrium gap guarantees.

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.

Abstract: The ability to display rich facial expressions is crucial for human-like robotic heads. While manually defining such expressions is intricate, there already exist approaches to automatically learn them. In this work one such approach is applied to evaluate and control a robot head different from the one in the original study. To improve the mapping of facial expressions from human actors onto a robot head, it is proposed to use 3D landmarks and their pairwise distances as input to the learning algorithm instead of the previously used facial action units. Participants of an online survey preferred mappings from our proposed approach in most cases, though there are still further improvements required.

Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning an unknown partition of $n$ elements into at most $k$ sets using simple queries that reveal information about a small subset of elements. Our starting point is the well-studied pairwise same-set queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same class. It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(n^2)$ queries, while adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known algorithm uses $k-1$ rounds. This problem has been studied extensively over the last two decades in multiple communities due to its fundamental nature and relevance to clustering, active learning, and crowd sourcing. In many applications, it is of high interest to reduce adaptivity while minimizing query complexity. We give a complete characterization of the deterministic query complexity of this problem as a function of the number of rounds, $r$, interpolating between the non-adaptive and adaptive settings: for any constant $r$, the query complexity is $\Theta(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^r-1}}k^{1-\frac{1}{2^r-1}})$. Our algorithm only needs $O(\log \log n)$ rounds to attain the optimal $O(nk)$ query complexity.
  Next, we consider two generalizations of pairwise queries to subsets $S$ of size at most $s$: (1) weak subset queries which return the number of classes intersected by $S$, and (2) strong subset queries which return the entire partition restricted on $S$. Once again in crowd sourcing applications, queries on large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show $\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that there is a non-adaptive algorithm using weak queries that matches this bound up to log-factors for all $s \leq \sqrt{n}$. More generally, we obtain nearly matching upper and lower bounds for algorithms using subset queries in terms of both the number of rounds, $r$, and the query size bound, $s$.

Abstract: The graph reconstruction problem has been extensively studied under various query models. In this paper, we propose a new query model regarding the number of connected components, which is one of the most basic and fundamental graph parameters. Formally, we consider the problem of reconstructing an $n$-node $m$-edge graph with oracle queries of the following form: provided with a subset of vertices, the oracle returns the number of connected components in the induced subgraph. We show $\Theta(\frac{m \log n}{\log m})$ queries in expectation are both sufficient and necessary to adaptively reconstruct the graph. In contrast, we show that $\Omega(n^2)$ non-adaptive queries are required, even when $m = O(n)$. We also provide an $O(m\log n + n\log^2 n)$ query algorithm using only two rounds of adaptivity.

Abstract: Hydrogen's role is growing as an energy carrier, increasing the need for efficient production, with methane steam reforming being the most widely used technique. This process is crucial for applications like fuel cells, where hydrogen is converted into electricity, pushing for reactor miniaturization and optimized process control through numerical simulations. Existing models typically address either kinetic or equilibrium regimes, limiting their applicability. Here we show a surrogate model capable of unifying both regimes. An artificial neural network trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes experimental data from kinetic and equilibrium experiments, interpolated data, and theoretical data derived from theoretical models for each regime. Data augmentation and assigning appropriate weights to each data type enhanced training. After evaluating Bayesian Optimization and Random Sampling, the optimal model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for the composition of the post-reaction mixture under varying operating parameters, indicated by a mean squared error of 0.000498 and strong Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.927. The network's ability to provide continuous derivatives of its predictions makes it particularly useful for process modeling and optimization. The results confirm the surrogate model's robustness for simulating methane steam reforming in both kinetic and equilibrium regimes, making it a valuable tool for design and process optimization.

Abstract: Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes, a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to $p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE); however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables $(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems, $q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.

<title>Differentiable neural network representation of multi-well, locally-convex potentials</title>

Abstract: Multi-well potentials are ubiquitous in science, modeling phenomena such as phase transitions, dynamic instabilities, and multimodal behavior across physics, chemistry, and biology. In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture representations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a log-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes. This log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a smooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for gradient-based learning and inference.
  A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both the number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression, enabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of the LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase transformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological gene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability distributions. These examples highlight the effectiveness of the LSE-ICNN in capturing complex multimodal landscapes while preserving differentiability, making it broadly applicable in data-driven modeling, optimization, and physical simulation.

<title>Conformal Safety Shielding for Imperfect-Perception Agents</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in a local safety guarantee. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs.

<title>A Framework for Generating Conversational Recommendation Datasets from Behavioral Interactions</title>

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems typically follow two complementary paradigms: collaborative filtering, which models long-term user preferences from historical interactions, and conversational recommendation systems (CRS), which interact with users in natural language to uncover immediate needs. Each captures a different dimension of user intent. While CRS models lack collaborative signals, leading to generic or poorly personalized suggestions, traditional recommenders lack mechanisms to interactively elicit immediate needs. Unifying these paradigms promises richer personalization but remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale conversational datasets grounded in real user behavior. We present ConvRecStudio, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogs grounded in timestamped user-item interactions and reviews. ConvRecStudio follows a three-stage pipeline: (1) Temporal Profiling, which constructs user profiles and community-level item sentiment trajectories over fine-grained aspects; (2) Semantic Dialog Planning, which generates a structured plan using a DAG of flexible super-nodes; and (3) Multi-Turn Simulation, which instantiates the plan using paired LLM agents for the user and system, constrained by executional and behavioral fidelity checks. We apply ConvRecStudio to three domains -- MobileRec, Yelp, and Amazon Electronics -- producing over 12K multi-turn dialogs per dataset. Human and automatic evaluations confirm the naturalness, coherence, and behavioral grounding of the generated conversations. To demonstrate utility, we build a cross-attention transformer model that jointly encodes user history and dialog context, achieving gains in Hit@K and NDCG@K over baselines using either signal alone or naive fusion. Notably, our model achieves a 10.9% improvement in Hit@1 on Yelp over the strongest baseline.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.
  Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning. Code for the experiments is available at the following

Abstract: We present Mercury, a new generation of commercial-scale large language models (LLMs) based on diffusion. These models are parameterized via the Transformer architecture and trained to predict multiple tokens in parallel. In this report, we detail Mercury Coder, our first set of diffusion LLMs designed for coding applications. Currently, Mercury Coder comes in two sizes: Mini and Small. These models set a new state-of-the-art on the speed-quality frontier. Based on independent evaluations conducted by Artificial Analysis, Mercury Coder Mini and Mercury Coder Small achieve state-of-the-art throughputs of 1109 tokens/sec and 737 tokens/sec, respectively, on NVIDIA H100 GPUs and outperform speed-optimized frontier models by up to 10x on average while maintaining comparable quality. We discuss additional results on a variety of code benchmarks spanning multiple languages and use-cases as well as real-world validation by developers on Copilot Arena, where the model currently ranks second on quality and is the fastest model overall. We also release a public API at https://platform.inceptionlabs.ai/ and free playground at https://chat.inceptionlabs.ai

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, the lack of systematic methods to assess their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks presents a critical security gap. We introduce the jailbreak oracle problem: given a model, prompt, and decoding strategy, determine whether a jailbreak response can be generated with likelihood exceeding a specified threshold. This formalization enables a principled study of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Answering the jailbreak oracle problem poses significant computational challenges -- the search space grows exponentially with the length of the response tokens. We present Boa, the first efficient algorithm for solving the jailbreak oracle problem. Boa employs a three-phase search strategy: (1) constructing block lists to identify refusal patterns, (2) breadth-first sampling to identify easily accessible jailbreaks, and (3) depth-first priority search guided by fine-grained safety scores to systematically explore promising low-probability paths. Boa enables rigorous security assessments including systematic defense evaluation, standardized comparison of red team attacks, and model certification under extreme adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect (ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves "imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts. Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual counterfactuals (non-actual).

Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes. These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

<title>Efficient Malware Detection with Optimized Learning on High-Dimensional Features</title>

Abstract: Malware detection using machine learning requires feature extraction from binary files, as models cannot process raw binaries directly. A common approach involves using LIEF for raw feature extraction and the EMBER vectorizer to generate 2381-dimensional feature vectors. However, the high dimensionality of these features introduces significant computational challenges. This study addresses these challenges by applying two dimensionality reduction techniques: XGBoost-based feature selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We evaluate three reduced feature dimensions (128, 256, and 384), which correspond to approximately 5.4%, 10.8%, and 16.1% of the original 2381 features, across four models-XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, and Random Forest-using a unified training, validation, and testing split formed from the EMBER-2018, ERMDS, and BODMAS datasets. This approach ensures generalization and avoids dataset bias. Experimental results show that LightGBM trained on the 384-dimensional feature set after XGBoost feature selection achieves the highest accuracy of 97.52% on the unified dataset, providing an optimal balance between computational efficiency and detection performance. The best model, trained in 61 minutes using 30 GB of RAM and 19.5 GB of disk space, generalizes effectively to completely unseen datasets, maintaining 95.31% accuracy on TRITIUM and 93.98% accuracy on INFERNO. These findings present a scalable, compute-efficient approach for malware detection without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) has emerged as an effective technique for modeling graph-structured data. When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in real-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful applications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus on preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order group interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world networks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static homogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in HTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order interaction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of heterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge construction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a novel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to fully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical attention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal message-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich semantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN performs contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order correlated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural ambiguity issue. Detailed experimental results on three real-world HTG datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed HTHGN for modeling high-order interactions in HTGs and demonstrate significant performance improvements.

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of graph metrics for measuring distances between graphs of different sizes. The proposed metric family defines a general form of the graph generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and is also proved to satisfy the metric properties. Similarly to the graph GOSPA metric, the proposed graph GOSPA metric family also penalises the node attribute costs for assigned nodes between the two graphs, and the number of unassigned nodes. However, the proposed family of metrics provides more general penalties for edge mismatches than the graph GOSPA metric. This paper also shows that the graph GOSPA metric family can be approximately computed using linear programming. Simulation experiments are performed to illustrate the characteristics of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family with different choices of hyperparameters. The benefits of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family for classification tasks are also shown on real-world datasets.

Abstract: In this study, we apply machine learning and software engineering in analyzing air pollution levels in City of Baltimore. The data model was fed with three primary data sources: 1) a biased method of estimating insurance risk used by homeowners loan corporation, 2) demographics of Baltimore residents, and 3) census data estimate of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. The dataset covers 650,643 Baltimore residents in 44.7 million residents in 202 major cities in US. The results show that air pollution levels have a clear association with the biased insurance estimating method. Great disparities present in NO2 level between more desirable and low income blocks. Similar disparities exist in air pollution level between residents' ethnicity. As Baltimore population consists of a greater proportion of people of color, the finding reveals how decades old policies has continued to discriminate and affect quality of life of Baltimore citizens today.

Abstract: Radiology students often struggle to develop perceptual expertise due to limited expert mentorship time, leading to errors in visual search and diagnostic interpretation. These perceptual errors, such as missed fixations, short dwell times, or misinterpretations, are not adequately addressed by current AI systems, which focus on diagnostic accuracy but fail to explain how and why errors occur. To address this gap, we introduce MAARTA (Multi-Agentic Adaptive Radiology Teaching Assistant), a multi-agent framework that analyzes gaze patterns and radiology reports to provide personalized feedback. Unlike single-agent models, MAARTA dynamically selects agents based on error complexity, enabling adaptive and efficient reasoning. By comparing expert and student gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed findings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies. MAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their errors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology education.

Abstract: The prediction of crystal properties is essential for understanding structure-property relationships and accelerating the discovery of functional materials. However, conventional approaches relying on experimental measurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations are often resource-intensive, limiting their scalability. Machine learning (ML) models offer a promising alternative by learning complex structure-property relationships from data, enabling faster predictions. Yet, existing ML models often rely on labeled data, adopt representations that poorly capture essential structural characteristics, and lack integration with physical principles--factors that limit their generalizability and interpretability. Here, we introduce CLOUD (Crystal Language mOdel for Unified and Differentiable materials modeling), a transformer-based framework trained on a novel Symmetry-Consistent Ordered Parameter Encoding (SCOPE) that encodes crystal symmetry, Wyckoff positions, and composition in a compact, coordinate-free string representation. Pre-trained on over six million crystal structures, CLOUD is fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks and achieves competitive performance in predicting a wide range of material properties, demonstrating strong scaling performance. Furthermore, as proof of concept of differentiable materials modeling, CLOUD is applied to predict the phonon internal energy and heat capacity, which integrates the Debye model to preserve thermodynamic consistency. The CLOUD-DEBYE framework enforces thermodynamic consistency and enables temperature-dependent property prediction without requiring additional data. These results demonstrate the potential of CLOUD as a scalable and physics-informed foundation model for crystalline materials, unifying symmetry-consistent representations with physically grounded learning for property prediction and materials discovery.

Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content reconstruction.

Abstract: This monograph studies the relations between two approaches using positive definite kernels: probabilistic methods using Gaussian processes, and non-probabilistic methods using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). They are widely studied and used in machine learning, statistics, and numerical analysis. Connections and equivalences between them are reviewed for fundamental topics such as regression, interpolation, numerical integration, distributional discrepancies, and statistical dependence, as well as for sample path properties of Gaussian processes. A unifying perspective for these equivalences is established, based on the equivalence between the Gaussian Hilbert space and the RKHS. The monograph serves as a basis to bridge many other methods based on Gaussian processes and reproducing kernels, which are developed in parallel by the two research communities.

Abstract: Localizing acoustic sound sources in the ocean is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of the environment. Factors such as high background noise, irregular underwater geometries, and varying acoustic properties make accurate localization difficult. To address these obstacles, we propose a multi-branch network architecture designed to accurately predict the distance between a moving acoustic source and a receiver, tested on real-world underwater signal arrays. The network leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust spatial feature extraction and integrates Conformers with self-attention mechanism to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Log-mel spectrogram and generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) features are employed as input representations. To further enhance the model performance, we introduce an Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) layer, that adaptively adjusts the amplitude of input features, ensuring consistent energy levels across varying ranges, signal strengths, and noise conditions. We assess the model's generalization capability by training it in one domain and testing it in a different domain, using only a limited amount of data from the test domain for fine-tuning. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in similar settings, establishing new benchmarks for underwater sound localization.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios, e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g., AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp, including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness.
